The Company is incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report.
The Company is registered in England and Wales.
The address of the registered office is 12 Smithfield Street, London EC1A 9BD.
The separate financial statements of the Company are also reported.
The financial statements represent the period from 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016.
The comparatives are for the period from 29 September 2014 to 30 September 2015.
The significant accounting policies have been disclosed below.
The policies for the Group and the Company are consistent unless otherwise stated.
Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, and changes in accounting policy a.
New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted In the current year, there have been no new standards, amendments or interpretations adopted.
Changes in accounting policy There have been no changes to accounting policy in the period.
c. New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective The table below sets out changes to accounting standards which will be effective for periods beginning on or after: Effective for period beginning on or after 1 IFRS 2 Amendments to Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions 1 Jan 2018 1 IFRS 4 Amendments to applying IFRS 9 with IFRS 4 1 Jan 2018 1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 Jan 2018 IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Amendments to Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exemption 1 Jan 2016 IFRS 11 Amendments to Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations 1 Jan 2016 1 IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts 1 Jan 2016 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 Jan 2018 1 IFRS 15 Clarifications to Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 Jan 2018 1 IFRS 16 Leases 1 Jan 2019 IAS 1 Amendments to Disclosure Initiative 1 Jan 2016 1 IAS 7 Amendments to Disclosure Initiative 1 Jan 2017 1 IAS 12 Amendments to Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses 1 Jan 2017 IAS 16 and IAS 38 Amendments to Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 1 Jan 2016 IAS 16 and IAS 41 Amendments to Bearer Plants 1 Jan 2016 IAS 27 Amendments to Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements 1 Jan 2016 Annual Improvements to IFRS 2012 2014 Cycle 1 Jan 2016 1 These amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
The Directors are reviewing the impact of these new standards, amendments and interpretations but do not intend to adopt the standards early.
It is not expected currently that these will have a material impact except for those mentioned below.
114 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION IFRS 16 Leases In January 2016 the International Accounting Standards Board IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases.
Under IFRS 16 a single lessee accounting model is introduced that replaces the current model where leases are either recognised as a finance or operating lease.
Under the single lessee model, an asset and corresponding liability will be recognised with movements through the profit and loss representing depreciation, additions or releases on the liability and unwinding of the discount.
IFRS 16 is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 this standard is yet to be endorsed by the EU with early adoption being permitted provided IFRS 15 is being applied.
Therefore, it will be first effective for the Groups accounting period ending 30 September 2020.
A full impact analysis is yet to be completed, the Directors expect IFRS 16 to have a material impact on the assets and the liabilities of the Group when the operating leases are recognised on the balance sheet see note 34.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements for both the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs adopted by the European Union, Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and Companies Act 2006. b.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the functional currency of the Company, rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
c. Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company and its subsidiaries.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
In accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC has taken advantage of the legal dispensation not to present its own Statement of Comprehensive Income or Income Statement.
The amount of the profit for the financial period dealt with in the financial statements of the Company is disclosed in the Company Statement of Changes in Equity and note 31. d. Going concern The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Further detail is contained in the going concern statement and the viability statement included in the Strategic Report on page 45. brewin.
co. uk 115 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued e. Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the Income Statement as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
f. Transaction date accounting All securities transactions entered into on behalf of clients are recorded in the accounts on the date of the transaction.
The underlying investments are not shown in the financial statements of the Group.
g. Foreign currencies In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Nonmonetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
h. Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents commissions, investment management fees, renewal commissions and other income, excluding VAT, receivable in respect of the period.
Investment management fees and renewal commissions are recognised in the period in which the related service is provided and commissions are recognised when the transaction is performed.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the Income Statement to the extent that they represent a realised profit and loss for the Company.
Other operating income Interest receivable and payable on client free money balances is netted to calculate the Groups share of interest receivable and included under the heading Other operating income.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and bank overdrafts.
116 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION k. Leases Rentals on operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are recognised as a liability.
The aggregate benefit of incentives is spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
l. Share-based payments Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at fair value of the equity instruments at the date of grant.
The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set out in note 33.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
m. Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in other years anditems that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
co. uk 117 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued n. Investments in subsidiaries In the Companys financial statements investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
o. Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest if any in the entity over the net of the identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not reversed in a subsequent period see note 3 v for the Impairment accounting policy.
When the consideration transferred by the Group is deferred or contingent, this is valued at its acquisition date fair value, and is included in the consideration transferred in a business combination.
Changes in the deferred or contingent consideration, which occur in the measurement period, are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments to goodwill.
Subsequent to the measurement period, the deferred and contingent considerations are revised annually at the balance sheet date and any corresponding adjustments are posted to the Income Statement.
Such deferred or contingent consideration may be settled in shares see note 3 t for the Shares to be issued accounting policy.
ii Client relationships Intangible assets classified as client relationships are recognised when acquired as part of a business combination or when separate payments are made to acquire funds by adding teams of investment managers.
Client relationships acquired separately are initially recognised at cost.
If acquired as part of a business combination the initial cost of client relationships is the fair value at the acquisition date.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
When separate payments are made to acquire funds by adding teams of investment managers, elements of the total consideration may be deferred or contingent.
In such cases the cost of the recognised client relationships includes the Companys best estimate of the future consideration likely to be made, discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, and is revised at each balance sheet date.
Client relationships are amortised over seven to fifteen years.
iii Computer software Computer software which is not an integral part of the related hardware is classified as an intangible asset.
Costs of acquiring computer software are treated as an intangible asset and amortised over three to ten years, dependent upon the assessment of the expected useful life of the software, on a straight-line basis from the date the software is operating as management intended.
The assessment of the expected useful life of computer software is based on the contractual terms or, where appropriate, past experience of the life of similar assets.
118 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION p. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment.
Depreciation has been provided on the basis of equal annual instalments to write off the cost less estimated residual values of tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful lives as follows: Computer equipment 3 to 4 years Office equipment 4 to 10 years Leasehold improvements to the earlier of the first break clause of the lease or 10 years Motor vehicles 5 years The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
Fair value measurement The Group measures financial instruments and certain non-financial assets at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.
In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.
Fair value for measurement and or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2, leasing transactions that are within the scope of IAS 17, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as value in use in IAS 36.
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date: Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
r. Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
i Financial assets Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL : available-for-sale financial assets: and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
co. uk 119 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Financial assets at FVTPL Financial assets are classified as FVTPL where the financial asset is held-for-trading.
A financial asset is classified as held-for-trading if it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future.
Financial assets classified as FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss.
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividends or interest earned on the financial asset and is included in the Income Statement.
"Their value is determined in the manner described in note 3 q. Available-for-sale financial assets ""AFS"" Certain shares held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value."
Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 3 q.
Gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the revaluation reserve with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised directly in profit or loss.
Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the revaluation reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.
Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in profit and loss when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments and are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets.
For listed and unlisted equity investments classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of the impairment.
When an AFS financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss in the period.
In subsequent periods if the amount of impaired loss decreases, in respect of AFS equity securities, impairment losses previously recognised in profit or loss are not reversed through profit or loss.
Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.
ii Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at FVTPL or other financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities are classified as FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss.
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability and is included in the other gains and losses line item in the Income Statement.
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
120 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION s. Netting of balances Amounts due to and from counterparties due to settle on balance are shown net where there is a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognised amounts and an operational intention to settle net.
Amounts due to and from counterparties due to settle against delivery of stock are shown gross.
t. Shares to be issued including premium Shares to be issued represent the Companys best estimate of the amount of ordinary shares in the Company, which are likely to be issued following business combinations or the acquisition of client relationships which involve deferred payments in the Companys shares.
The sum payable which will be converted into shares of equivalent value is discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and is revised annually in the light of actual results.
The resulting interest charge from the unwind of the discount is included within finance costs.
Where shares are due to be issued within a year the sum is included in current liabilities.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on scheme assets excluding interest are recognised immediately in the Balance Sheet with a charge or credit to the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur.
Remeasurement recorded in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income is not recycled.
Any past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
The defined benefit pension scheme asset liability recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
v. Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
For the purposes of impairment testing, client relationships and goodwill are allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units.
Fair value is established by valuing clients funds in each of the cash-generating units at the period end: the percentages of funds being used depending on values attributed in recent public transactions for the purchase of advisory and discretionary funds.
If the carrying amount relating to any cash-generating unit exceeds the calculated fair value less costs to sell, a value in use is calculated using a discounted cash flow method.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
If the recoverable amount of any asset other than client relationships or goodwill is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
co. uk 121 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued w. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows where the effect of the time value of money is material.
Where some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received and the amount receivable can be measured reliably.
Onerous contracts Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions.
An onerous contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale.
Components of the Group are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered or settled principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as being met only when the sale is highly probable and the component is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Components of the Group classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
No depreciation is charged on businesses classified as held for sale.
Employee share ownership trusts Brewin Dolphin Limited is the sponsoring employer of the Brewin Dolphin Share Incentive Plan Trust and the Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Employee Share Ownership Trust.
The assets and liabilities of the trusts are recognised as those of Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC and obligations of the trusts are regarded as obligations of Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC.
Shares of Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC held by the trusts are treated as own shares held and shown as a deduction in equity.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies There have been no critical judgements required in applying the Groups accounting policies in this period, apart from those involving estimations which are detailed separately below.
122 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION b.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty i.
Goodwill and client relationships Amortisation of client relationships The useful economic life over which client relationships are amortised is determined by the expected duration of the client relationships which are determined with reference to past experience of account closures, in particular the average life of those relationships, and future expectations.
During the period, client relationships were amortised over a 7 to 15 year period.
The amortisation for the period was 6,287,000 2015: 9,219,000 : a reduction in the average amortisation period by one year would increase the amortisation expense for the period by 2,144,000 2015: 2,248,000.
Impairment of goodwill and client relationships Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
For the purposes of impairment testing, the Group values the recoverable amount of goodwill and client relationships at the fair value less costs of disposal.
The calculation of the fair value less costs of disposal is based on the valuation of the funds, which make up the relevant intangible asset.
A percentage is applied to funds 3% for discretionary funds and 1% for advisory funds to determine the fair value.
These percentages have been based on recent public transactions.
Therefore, the recoverable amount is sensitive to movements in the valuation of funds.
The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained in note 17. ii.
Defined benefit pension scheme The calculation of the present value of the defined benefit pension scheme is determined by using actuarial valuations.
Management make key assumptions in determining the inputs into the actuarial valuations, which may differ from actual developments in the future.
These assumptions are governed by IAS 19 Employee Benefits revised 2011, and include the determination of the discount rate, life expectancies and future salary increases.
Due to the complexities in the valuation, the defined benefit pension scheme obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions.
The detailed assumptions, including a sensitivity analysis, are set out in note 21. iii.
Share-based payments Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP During the period, the Group granted its third award under the LTIP.
The scheme includes performance based vesting conditions, which impacts the amount of benefit paid.
The Group has made assumptions on the likelihood of meeting the performance conditions in determining the expense in the period.
If all of the performance conditions were assumed to be met, the charge for the period would increase by 1,692,000 2015: 1,535,000 : an absolute increase of 10% in the vesting assumptions would increase the charge for the period by 300,000 2015: 251,000.
Further information on the scheme is disclosed in note 33. iv.
Provisions Onerous leases The Group recognises a provision for onerous leases of 4,135,000 2015: 4,069,000.
The valuation of an onerous lease is based on the best estimate of the likely future costs discounted to present value.
Where the provision is in relation to premises and it is more likely than not that the premises will be sublet, an allowance for sublease income has been included in the valuation.
If the assumptions regarding the sublet income are removed, the provision would increase by 6,355,000 2015: 1,232,000 to 10,490,000 2015: 5,301,000.
Further information is disclosed in note 27. brewin.

For client relationships, impairment testing is performed at each reporting date.
The recoverable amount for each of the CGUs is the fair value less costs of disposal.
The fair value is determined by applying percentages to the funds for each CGU.
The percentages applied are a Level 2 input based on recent observable market transactions.
Discretionary funds are valued at 3% and advisory funds are valued at 1% of assets under management.
Sensitivity analysis of the key assumptions A 10bps absolute change in the value of funds used for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing impacts the valuation of the CGUs collectively by 3.5% or 24 million movement on the estimated value of funds of 682 million of the CGUs which have goodwill balances as at 30 September 2016.

Defined benefit pension scheme The Group operates a registered Defined Contribution Scheme the Brewin Dolphin Senior Staff Pension Fund and a registered Defined Benefit Scheme the Brewin Dolphin Limited RBS in the UK which both offer pensions in retirement and death benefits to members.
The disclosures provided are in respect of the Defined Benefit Scheme only the Scheme.
Pension benefits are related to the members final salary at retirement and their length of service.
The pension is payable for life and has elements increasing in payment in line with inflation up to a maximum of 5% p. a.
Since 1 April 2003 the Scheme has been closed to new members.
Members under age 55 at 1 April 2004 ceased to accrue further service in the Scheme from that date.
Contributions to the Scheme for the year beginning 1 October 2016 are expected to be 3.0 million.
The Scheme is an HMRC registered pension scheme and is subject to standard UK pensions and tax law.
This means that the payment of contributions and benefits are subject to the appropriate tax treatments and restrictions and the Scheme is subject to the Scheme funding requirements outlined in Section 224 of the Pensions Act 2004.
The Scheme was established under trust and is governed by the Schemes Trust Deed and Rules.
In accordance with UK trust and pensions law, the Scheme has appointed Trustees.
Although the Group bears the financial cost of the Scheme, the responsibility for the management and governance of the Scheme lies with the Trustees, who have a duty to act in the best interest of members at all times.
Valuation for funding purposes The valuation as at 31 December 2014: 000 Value of scheme assets 81,609 Actuarial value of scheme liabilities in respect of In-service members 17,598 Deferred pensioners 31,459 Current pensioners and dependants 43,926 Value of scheme liabilities 92,983 Scheme deficit 11,374 Funding level 88% The Scheme is valued for funding purposes at intervals of not more than three years by an independent qualified actuary.
The latest valuation for funding purposes was as at 31 December 2014.
The Group and the Schemes Trustees agreed a deficit reduction plan following the 2014 valuation and it was agreed that Brewin Dolphin Limited would pay contributions of 250,000 per month from 1 January 2015 with a view to eliminate the deficit by 28 February 2019.
The next actuarial valuation of the Scheme is due as at 31 December 2017 and a revised deficit reduction plan will be considered as part of this exercise.
The administration costs of the Scheme, including investment management fees and Scheme levy payments, are currently paid by Brewin Dolphin Limited as they fall due.
co. uk 137 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 21.
Defined benefit pension scheme continued Summary of amounts recognised in the financial statements under IAS 19 In the consolidated financial statements, the Group accounts for pension costs, other post-retirement benefits and related redundancy provisions in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
Under the standard, the difference between the market values of Scheme assets and the present value of Scheme liabilities is reported as a surplus to the extent a surplus may be seen or deficit in the Balance Sheet.
The accounting value is different from the result obtained using the funding basis.
The accounts show the Scheme has a smaller deficit than that revealed by the last funding valuation.
The main reasons for this are the difference between the experience of the Scheme over the period from 1 January 2015 to 30 September 2016 and that assumed for the purposes of the funding valuation as at 31 December 2014, and the differences in the assumptions used to value the liabilities in the accounting and funding valuations for the Scheme.
In the preparation of the valuations under IAS 19 referred to in this note, the actuary has used the assumptions indicated below, which the Group has directed for the purposes of accounting and disclosure under IAS 19.
Risks The main risks to which the Group is exposed in relation to the pension scheme are: Mortality risk the assumptions adopted by the Group make allowance for future improvements in life expectancy.
However, if life expectancy improves at a faster rate than assumed, this would result in greater payments from the Scheme and consequently increases in the Schemes liabilities.
The Group and the Schemes Trustees review the mortality assumption on a regular basis to minimise this risk.
Investment risk the Scheme invests its assets in a diversified portfolio of assets.
There are risks that the assets underperform relative to increases in the value of the Schemes liabilities increasing the cost to the Group of the benefit provision.
There is a risk that the assets invested in do not sufficiently match the characteristics of the Schemes liabilities and so a fall in asset values is not similarly matched by a fall in the value of the liabilities.
While certain assets are chosen that match the characteristics of the Schemes liabilities and membership profile, the Scheme currently invests in a high proportion of equities and assets that are not expected to closely match the majority of the Schemes liabilities.
The Schemes Trustees review the performance of the assets and structure of the portfolio on a regular basis to ensure the risks being taken under investment are commensurate with normal Trustee principles and the ability of the Group to mitigate adverse investment experience.
Price inflation risk some of the Schemes benefits increase in line with price inflation and so if inflation is greater than expected, the costs of providing these benefits will increase.
The Scheme holds government bonds with payments also linked to inflation to assist in mitigating this risk.
Scheme investment strategy and level of matching The Schemes investment strategy is to invest broadly 82.5% in higher return seeking assets e. g. equities, high yielding bonds etc.
and 17.5% in matching assets e. g. fixed interest gilts and index-linked gilts.
The objective is to target an investment return of 2.5% per annum net of fees in excess of a portfolio of gilts that closely matches the behaviour of the Schemes funding liabilities.
This return objective will fall over time, as the proportion of matching assets are increased as the scheme matures, to 0.6% per annum net of fees once all the members have retired.
The Scheme also has liability matching swaps in place so that, along with the matching assets, the majority of the movement in the Schemes funding liabilities should be matched by similar movements in the assets.
This strategy reflects the Schemes liability profile and the Trustees and Companys attitude to risk.
The asset allocations as at 30 September 2016 and 30 September 2015 are provided below, disaggregated between assets that are believed to have a quoted market price in an active market and those that are unquoted.
138 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION None of the assets of the pension schemes are invested in the Groups own financial instruments and none of the assets are properties or other assets used by the Group.

The timing of the settlements is unknown, but it is expected that they will be resolved within 12 months.
The onerous contracts provision is in respect of both surplus office space and contracts associated with discontinued operations.
The valuation of an onerous contract is based on the best estimate of the likely costs discounted to present value.
Provision of 4.1 million 2015: 4.1 million has been made for surplus office space, which the Group may not be able to sublet in the short term.
The maximum exposure is the current estimated amount that the Group would have to pay to meet the future obligations under these lease contracts, which is approximately 11.3 million as at 30 September 2016 2015: 6.9 million, if the assumption regarding sublets is removed and the time value of money is ignored.
The longest lease term covered by the provision has 16.5 years remaining and accounts for 3.6 million of the provision.
Provision of 0.2 million 2015: 10.3 million has been made in relation to onerous contracts resulting from discontinued operations.
These costs arise over the term of the contract.
The contracts covered by the provision have a maximum remaining term of three months and the maximum exposure is 0.2 million, if the time value of money is ignored.
During the period settlement has been made in relation to certain contracts.
The Group recognises a provision of 1.9 million 2015: 2.3 million for leasehold dilapidations.
These costs are expected to arise at the end of the lease.
The leases covered by the provision have a maximum remaining term of 16.5 years.

Financial instruments and risk management Overview This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the financial instrument key risks market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk, the Groups policy and procedures for measuring and managing risk and the Groups management of capital.
Risk management The Board of Directors have overall responsibility for establishing and overseeing the Groups Risk Management Framework and risk appetite.
The Board have established a clear relationship between the Groups strategic objectives and the level of capital which the Board is prepared to place at risk through a Risk Appetite Statement.
The Risk Appetite Statement outlines the nature and quantum of risk that the Board wishes the Group to bear its risk appetite in order to achieve its strategic objectives whilst remaining within all regulatory constraints and its own defined levels of capital and liquidity.
The Board reviews the statement and related qualitative and quantitative measures on at least an annual basis to ensure the document continues to reflect the Boards appetite for risk within the context of the environment in which the Group operates.
The Groups Board Risk Committee provides oversight of the adequacy of the Groups Risk Management Framework based on the risks to which the Group is exposed.
It monitors how management comply with the Groups risk management policies and procedures.
It is assisted in the discharge of this duty by the Groups Risk & Compliance Department which has responsibility for monitoring the overall risk environment of the Group.
The Board Risk Committee also regularly monitors exposure against the Groups Risk Appetite.
The Groups Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the financial statements and working closely with the Board Risk Committee, for both review and oversight of internal controls.
The Audit Committee is assisted in the discharge of its obligations by Internal Audit who undertake periodic and ad-hoc reviews on the effectiveness of controls and compliance with risk management policies.
148 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION The Groups risk management policies are intended to ensure that risks are identified, evaluated and subject to ongoing monitoring and mitigation where appropriate.
The risk policies also serve to set the appropriate control framework, the adequacy and effectiveness of which is also subject to ongoing testing and review.
The aim is to promote a robust risk culture with employees across the Group understanding their role and obligations under the framework.
Capital structure and capital management The capital structure of the Group and Company consists of issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated and Company Statement of Changes in Equity.
Capital generated from the business is both reinvested in the business to generate future growth and returned to shareholders, principally in the form of dividends.
Consideration is given to regulatory capital requirements and to ensure the Group is adequately capitalisedto withstand periods of market stress.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the period.
Regulatory capital requirements The Group conducts an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, as required by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA to assess the appropriate amount of regulatory capital to be held by the Group.
There are two regulated entities in the Group: Brewin Dolphin Limited BDL regulated by the FCA and Tilman Brewin Dolphin Limited regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.
The Jersey branch of BDL is regulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission.
The Pillar II capital assessment of the ICAAP is the Board of Directors opinion of the level of capital the Group should hold against the risks to which the Group is exposed.
This takes into the account the Groups Principal Risk Register which is updated on a regular basis.
The ICAAP is kept updated throughout the year to take account of changes to the Groups Principal Risks and for any material changes to strategy or business plans.
The ICAAP is discussed and approved at a Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Board meeting at least annually.
Regulatory capital adequacy is monitored by management.
The Group uses the standardised approach to Credit Risk to calculate PillarI requirements.
The Group complied with the FCAs regulatory capital requirements throughout the period.
The regulatory capital resources of the Group were as follows: 2016 2015 000 000 Share capital 2,830 2,793 Share premium account 151,836 142,135 Own shares 29,294 28,153 Revaluation reserve 24 Merger reserve 70,553 70,553 Profit and loss account 46,908 31,823 242,809 219,151 Shares to be issued 9,304 Regulatory capital resources before deductions 242,809 228,455 Deduction Intangible assets net of deferred tax liability 78,746 83,076 Deduction Free deliveries 82 88 Total regulatory capital resources after deductions 163,981 145,291 Information disclosure under Pillar 3 of the Capital Requirements Directive will be published on the Groups website before 31 December 2016 at www.

Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of the Groups market risk management is to both control and manage exposure within the Groups risk appetite whilst accepting the inherent risk of market fluctuations.
The Group undertakes investment management and stockbroking activities on an agency basis on behalf of its clients.
The Group holds financial instruments as principal, but does not trade as principal.
All trades are matched in the market see note 20.
The Group transacts foreign currency deals in order to fulfil our client obligations and any non-sterling costs to our business.
Foreign currency exposure is matched intra-day and at the end of each day.
The total net foreign exchange exposure resulting from income yet to be converted to sterling at the year end was a debtor of 537,000 2015: 495,000.
At the period end Tilman Brewin Dolphin Limited TBD had net assets of 3.6 million 2015: 3.6 million denominated in its local currency Euros.
The Group is exposed to translation risk in respect of the foreign currency value of the net assets of TBD.
The Group does not hold any derivatives 2015: none.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk during the period.
150 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION Equity price risk The Group is exposed to equity risk arising from both available-for-sale and held-for-trading investments.
Equity price sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at the reporting date.
If equity prices had been 5% higher lower: Pre-tax profit for the period ended 30 September 2016 would have been 52,000 higher lower 2015: 47,000 higher lower due to changes in the value of held-for-trading investment: and Other equity reserves as at 30 September 2016 would increase decrease by 6,400 2015: increase decrease by 2,300 pre-tax for the Group as a result of the changes in fair value of available-for-sale investments.
The Groups sensitivity to equity prices has not changed significantly from the prior period.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in respect of the Groups cash and in respect of client deposits.
The Group holds client deposits on demand and in 30 day notice accounts variable interest rates.
During the period a 1% increase in base rate would have increased pre-tax profitability by 1,068,000 2015: 939,000. Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a client or other counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Groups exposure to credit risk arises principally from the settlement of client and market transactions settlement risk and cash deposited at banks.
Settlement risk Exposures to settlement risk are spread across a large number of counterparties and clients.
A delivery versus payment DVP settlement method is also used for the majority of transactions, ensuring that securities and cash are exchanged within a short period of time.
