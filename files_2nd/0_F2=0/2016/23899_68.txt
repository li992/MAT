Fidessa group plc 89 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 21 Financial risk management continued Capital management The Board monitors the total equity, distributable reserves and the cash and cash equivalents balance in considering its retained capital along with when and how a return of capital to shareholders is appropriate.
A strong capital base is maintained so as to provide employee, customer, market, investor and creditor confidence in the business and to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern.
Fidessa has strong cash generation due to being consistently profitable and non-acquisitive in nature.
The annual dividends paid during 2016 represented 42.9% 2015: 49.2% of the profit for the year attributable to shareholders.
This provides a reasonable return to shareholders whilst also providing funds for potential acquisitions and replenishing the cash balance.
However, in the absence of acquisitions, Fidessa has a track record of returning the additional cash to shareholders in the form of special dividends.
Fair values Unless otherwise disclosed, there is no significant difference between the carrying values shown in the balance sheet and the fair values of the financial instruments.
For current trade and other receivables and payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the amortised cost is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Fidessa does not have any derivative financial instruments and therefore no analysis is required in respect of financial instruments not measured at fair value.
