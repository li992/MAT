Accounting Policies The Company is a public limited company PLC incorporated in England and Wales, with registered office of 50 Lothian Road, Festival Square, Edinburgh EH3 9WJ.
The principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year in the preparation of these Financial Statements, are set out below: a Basis of preparation The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of investments, and in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice GAAP and the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies and dated November 2014 and the Companies Act 2006.
The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as set out on page 68.
The Directors believe this is appropriate as the Companys net assets consist almost entirely of liquid securities which are quoted on recognised stock exchanges.
In preparing these financial statements the Company has applied FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Ireland for the first time.
Aside from presentational aspects relating to the Statement of Cash Flows, no significant changes have arisen from the adoption of the new standards.
Where changes have arisen, they are substantially in relation to presentation, disclosure and non-quantifiable aspects there has been no impact to the financial position or the financial performance and no comparative figures required restating.
In preparing these financial statements the Company has early adopted amendments to FRS 102: Fair value hierarchy disclosures March 2016 published by the FRC see note 17 on beginning on page 55.
Presentation of the Income Statement In order to reflect better the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with the SORP, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Income Statement.
The net revenue return is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Sections 1158 and 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
Judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty The preparation of the financial statements requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the Statement of Financial Position date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.
However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
In the process of applying the Companys accounting policies, the Directors have made the following judgement, apart from those involving estimations, which has the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements: X1@ MFIMGL AFN KLE FL AF #JGKLJGO 9HAL9D - @9K : F N9DM :Q L@ !AJ :LGJK 9L LOG LAE K #JGKLJGO K 9FFM9D J :MJJAF?
revenues with a 10% liquidity discount applied.
b Investments held at fair value through profit or loss As the Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of dividends, interest or increases in fair value, investments are designated at fair value through profit or loss and are initially recognised at fair value.
The Company manages and evaluates the performance of these investments on a fair value basis in accordance with its investment strategy, and information about the investments is provided internally on this basis to the Board.
Fair value for quoted investments is deemed to be bid market prices, or last traded price, depending on the convention of the stock exchange on which they are quoted.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss, and gains and losses on disposal are recognised in the Income Statement as a capital item.
All purchases and sales of investments are accounted for on the trade date basis.
The Companys policy is to expense transaction costs on acquisition through the capital column of the Income Statement.
The total of such expenses, showing the total amounts included in disposals and acquisitions are disclosed in note 9 on page 53.

Accounting Policies continued c Investment Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised on the ex-dividend date.
Fixed returns on non-equity shares are recognised on a time apportionment basis.
Special dividends: In deciding whether a dividend should be regarded as a capital or revenue receipt, the Company reviews all relevant information as to the reasons for and sources of the dividend on a case by case basis depending upon the nature of the receipt.
The limited liability partnership LLP profit share is recognised in the financial statements when the entitlement to the income is established.
d Dividend Payments Dividends paid by the Company on its shares are recognised in the financial statements in the period in which they are paid and are shown in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
e Expenditure and Finance Charges All the expense and finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue column of the Income Statement except as follows: 1 expenses which are incidental to the acquisition or disposal of an investment are treated as part of the cost or proceeds of that investment as explained in 1 b above : 2 expenses are taken to the capital reserve via the capital column of the Income Statement, where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In line with the Boards expected long term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income from the Companys portfolio, 67% of the portfolio management fee, AIFM fee and finance costs are taken to the capital reserve: f Taxation Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not been reversed by the Statement of Financial Position date other than those differences regarded as permanent.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the reversal of timing differences can be deducted.
Any liability to deferred tax is provided for at the rate of tax enacted or substantially enacted.
Any tax relief obtained in respect of AIFM and portfolio management fees, finance costs and other capital expenses charged or allocated to the capital column of the Income Statement is reflected in the Capital Reserve and a corresponding amount is charged against the revenue column of the Income Statement.
The tax relief is the amount by which corporation tax payable is reduced as a result of these capital expenses.
g Foreign currency Transactions recorded in overseas currencies during the year are translated into Sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in overseas currencies at the Statement of Financial Position date are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
h Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and demand deposits readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
i Nature and purpose of reserves Special reserve The special reserve arose following Court approval in July 2002 to transfer 13.16 million from the share premium account.
This reserve is distributable and has historically been used to fund any share buy-backs by the Company.
Capital redemption reserve This reserve arose when ordinary shares were redeemed by the Company and subsequently cancelled, at which point the amount equal to the par value of the ordinary share capital was transferred from the ordinary share capital to the capital redemption reserve.

Risk Management As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objective as stated on page 16.
In pursuit of its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the revenue returns available for distribution.
The Companys financial instruments comprise mainly of equity investments, cash balances, borrowings, debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The principal risks inherent in managing the Companys financial instruments are market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
These risks and the Directors approach to the management of them are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 22 to 24.
Market risk Market risk comprises three types of risk: market price risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.
Market price risk As an investment company, performance is dependent on the performance of the underlying companies and securities in which it invests.
The market price of investee companies shares is subject to their performance, supply and demand for the shares and investor sentiment regarding the company or the industry sector in which it operates.
Consequently market price risk is one of the most significant risks to which the Company is exposed.
At 30 September 2016, the fair value of the Companys assets exposed to market price risk was 956,592,000 2015: 692,951,000 see page 58.
If the fair value of the Companys investments at the Statement of Financial Position date increased or decreased by 20%, while all other variables remained constant, the capital return and net assets attributable to shareholders for the year ended 30 September 2016 would have increased or decreased by 191,318,000 or 134.4p per share 2015: 138,590,000 or 114.6p per share.
No derivatives or hedging instruments are currently utilised to manage market price risk.

Risk Management continued Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.

Borrowings varied throughout the year as part of the Boards endorsed policy.
Borrowings at the year-end amounted to 34,500,000 2015: 29,000,000 at an interest rate of 1.86% LIBOR plus 1.30% per annum.
If the above level of borrowing was maintained for a year a 1% increase decrease in LIBOR would decrease increase the revenue return by 114,000, 2015: 96,000 decrease increase the capital return by 231,000 2015: 194,000, and decrease increase the net assets by 345,000 2015: 290,000.
The weighted average interest rate, during the year, on borrowings under the above mentioned revolving credit facility was 1.88% 2015: 1.87%.
On the 4 October 2016 the Board renewed the facility agreement with Scotiabank, for a further three years.
Under the new agreement interest is charged at LIBOR plus 1.05% per annum, previously charged at LIBOR plus 1.30% per annum.

Risk Management continued Currency risk The Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the functional currency and presentational currency of the Company.
At 30 September 2016, the Companys investments, with the exception of five, were priced in sterling.
The five exceptions, Heineken, listed in the Netherlands, Remy Cointreau listed in France, and Dr. Pepper Snapple, The Kraft Heinz Company and Mondelez International, all listed in the United States, represent 18% of the portfolio see page 9.
The AIFM and the Portfolio Manager monitor the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a continuous basis and regularly report to the Board.
The Company does not hedge against foreign currency movements, but the Portfolio Manager takes account of the risk when making investment decisions.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between its receipt and the time that the income is included in the Financial Statements.
The following table details the sensitivity of the Companys capital or revenue return after taxation for the year to a % increase and decrease in sterling against foreign currency, after applying the average rate of volatility of the currency over the year.
The average rate of volatility for each currency over the year: U. S. dollars 4.4% increase and decrease 2015: 1.8%, Canadian dollars 5.9% 2015: 4.0% and Euros 5.0% 2015: 3.6%.
If sterling had weakened against the foreign currencies, as stated above, this would have had the following effect: 2016 2015 US$ Canadian$ Euro US$ Canadian$ Euro 000 000 000 000 000 000 Increase in revenue return 17 27 4 3 Increase in capital return 3,880 4,492 1,148 442 2,066 Total return after tax increase in shareholders funds 3,897 4,519 1,152 442 2,069 If sterling had strengthened against the foreign currency as stated above, this would have had the following effect: 2016 2015 US$ Canadian$ Euro US$ Canadian$ Euro 000 000 000 000 000 000 Decrease in revenue return 16 25 4 2 Decrease in capital return 3,555 4,068 1,106 408 1,922 Total return after tax decrease in shareholders funds 3,571 4,093 1,110 408 1,924 Credit Risk Credit risk is the Companys exposure to financial loss from the failure of a counterparty to deliver securities or cash for acquisition or disposals of investments which could result in the Company suffering a financial loss.
Credit risk is managed as follows: Investment transactions are carried out only with brokers whose creditworthiness is reviewed by the Portfolio Manager.
Transactions are ordinarily undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis whereby the Companys custodian bank ensures that the counterparty to any transactions entered into by the Company has delivered its obligation before any transfer of cash or securities away from the Company is completed.
Any failing trades in the market are closely monitored by both the AIFM and the Portfolio Manager.
Cash is only held at banks that have been identified by the Board as reputable and of high credit quality.
