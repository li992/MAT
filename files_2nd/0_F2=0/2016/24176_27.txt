The principal accounting policies and measurement bases adopted are the same as those disclosed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, except as noted below, and have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless stated otherwise.
Judgments made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies which have a significant effect on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment, have been disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason the directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Exemptions In accordance with section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement.
The Company has taken advantage of certain disclosure exemptions in FRS 101, in part because its financial statements are included in the publicly-available consolidated financial statements of G4S plc.
These disclosure exemptions relate to: the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: the statement of compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union: new IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective and which have not been applied by the Company: comparative information for the movements from the beginning to the end of the year in respect of intangible assets and certain other additional comparative information: information on the assumptions used in the determination of fair value and recoverable amounts of cash-generating units containing goodwill and managements approach to determining these amounts: financial instruments disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement: certain related-party disclosures on key management compensation and transactions entered into between two or more whollyowned members of a Group: and capital management disclosures.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
The accounting policy for impairments is disclosed in note 3 j to the consolidated financial statements.
Amounts owed by to Group undertakings Amounts owed by to Group undertakings are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Finance income and expense are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
Impairment of financial assets The Company provides for impairments in financial assets when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that impact the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets.
Integr Integrated ated Repor Report t and and Accounts 2016 Accounts 2016 G4S plc G4S plc 179 179 Notes to the parent company financial statements continued c Significant accounting policies continued Share-based payments The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value of share-based payments is determined at the date of grant and is either expensed or capitalised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary, with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
The amount expensed or capitalised is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.
The Company also issues cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees, which are recognised as a liability at fair value at the date of grant.
The value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date on which the liability is settled.
The fair value of share-based payments is expensed in the income statement if it relates to employees of the Company and capitalised as an investment in the relevant subsidiary if it relates to employees of a subsidiary company.
Financial guarantees The Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group.
The Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
The Company therefore treats such contracts as a contingent liability unless and until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.

The source of the market prices is Bloomberg and in addition the third party relationship counterparty banks.
The relevant currency yield curve is used to forecast the floating-rate cash flows anticipated under the instrument, which are discounted back to the reporting date.
This value is compared to the original transaction value giving a fair value of the instrument at the reporting date.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach and using inputs based on observable market data.
Judgment is used to determine the relevant inputs, currency yield curves and discount rates.
Although these judgments, estimates and associated assumptions are based on managements best knowledge of current events and circumstances, the actual results may differ.
Currency risk and cross-currency swaps The Group conducts business in many currencies.
The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and as a consequence is subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The Company, together with its subsidiary G4S International Finance plc, hedges a substantial portion of the Groups exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of the Group's overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in equity to match exchange differences on foreign currency equity investments, as they qualify as net-investment hedges.
However, in the Company's own financial statements, exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in the income statement and are in part hedged by cross-currency swaps.
Cross-currency swaps with a nominal value of 25m are outstanding.
These swaps were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on US$50m of the second US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively fixing the sterling value on this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
These swaps will mature in July 2018.
182 182 G4S G4S plc plc Integrated Integrated Repor Report and t and Accounts Accounts 2016 2016 Financial report Interest-rate risk and interest-rate swaps Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Company to fair value interest-rate risk, which the Company manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
When fixed floating interest-rate debt in the preferred mix is unavailable directly from investors, interest-rate swaps are utilised to create the desired blend and meet Treasury policy, with the proportion of fixed interest rate held reducing on a sliding scale over forward periods up to a maximum of five years.
The quantity of interest-rate swaps outstanding in the Company is expected to continue to decline as treasury activity is increasingly conducted by G4S International Finance plc.
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fixed-rate market, with investors preferring a fixed-rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of the first issue in March 2007, the Group was comfortable with the proportion of floating-rate exposure not hedged by interest-rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fixed-rate debt it arranged fixed-to-floating swaps, effectively converting the fixed coupon on the Private Placement to a floating rate.
Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is LIBOR 60bps.
These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fixed-interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profit and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 and on the 350m public notes issued in May 2009, was initially kept at fixed rate.
In April 2014, the interest rate on 44m of the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 and on all of the 350m public notes issued in May 2009 was swapped from fixed to floating for a period of three years using derivatives.
These swaps have also been documented as fair-value hedges.
The 350m public notes have a coupon step-up of 1.25%, which is triggered should the credit rating of the Company fall below investment grade.
k Retirement benefit obligations The Company is the sponsoring company for the Groups UK defined benefit pension scheme, to which it provides a guarantee over all payments to be made to the scheme by the operating companies.
The required disclosures for this scheme are given in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.
The following disclosures relate to the UK scheme only and are given because the same disclosures in note 32 of the Group financial statements refer to the consolidated Group position and include certain non-UK schemes.
The amounts recognised in the statement of financial position and the various components of income, other comprehensive income and cash flow are as follows: Obligation Assets Provision 2016 m m m At 1 January 2016 2,218 2,029 189 Amounts recognised in income Current service cost in cost of sales 4 4 Interest on obligations and assets in finance costs 82 76 6 Administration costs paid from plan assets in administration expenses 2 2 Total amounts recognised in income 88 76 12 Re-measurements Actuarial loss change in financial assumptions 539 539 Actuarial gain change in demographic assumptions 82 82 Actuarial gain experience 22 22 Return on assets in excess of interest 273 273 Re-measurement effects recognised in other comprehensive income 435 273 162 Cash Employer contributions 43 43 Benefits paid from plan assets 82 82 Net cash 82 39 43 At 31 December 2016 2,659 2,339 320 Integr Integrated ated Repor Report t and and Accounts 2016 Accounts 2016 G4S plc G4S plc 183 183 Notes to the parent company financial statements continued k Retirement benefit obligations continued Obligation Assets Provision 2015 m m m At 1 January 2015 2,222 1,983 239 Amounts recognised in income Current service cost in cost of sales 5 5 Interest on obligations and assets in finance costs 81 73 8 Administration costs paid from plan assets in administration expenses 2 2 Total amounts recognised in income 88 73 15 Re-measurements Actuarial gain change in financial assumptions 13 13 Actuarial loss change in demographic assumptions 34 34 Actuarial gain experience 33 33 Return on assets in excess of interest 3 3 Re-measurement effects recognised in other comprehensive income 12 3 15 Cash Employer contributions Employee contributions 50 50 Benefits paid from plan assets 80 80 Net cash 80 30 50 At 31 December 2015 2,218 2,029 189 Contributions in 2016 included 39m 2015: 44m of additional contributions in respect of the deficit in the UK scheme.
l Deferred tax assets The reconciliation of deferred tax assets is as follows: Retirement Other Intangible benefit Share-based temporary Total assets obligation payments Tax losses differences m m m m m m At 1 January 2016 36 1 6 43 Credit charge to the income statement 1 1 58 6 54 Credit to equity 24 24 Charge to equity change in tax rate 3 3 At 31 December 2016 1 57 2 58 118 At 1 January 2015 48 1 49 Charge credit to the income statement 7 6 1 Charge to equity 3 3 Charge to equity change in tax rate 2 2 At 31 December 2015 36 1 6 43 At 31 December 2016, the Company had unutilised tax losses of approximately 298m 2015: 304m potentially available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset of 58m 2015: nil has been recognised in respect of approximately 298m 2015: nil of gross losses based on profitability from approved budgets and business plans.
The recognition of additional deferred tax assets on tax losses during the period is predicated on the projected generation of income in the Company which should result in the utilisation of the available tax losses within a foreseeable period.
This income stream is driven by the current and future global results of the Group in line with business plans.
The timing of recognition of the tax losses as a deferred tax asset in 2016 is supported by the improved profit profile of the Company, which itself is underpinned by the continuing progress of the Groups transformation strategy to generate future sustainable, profitable growth.
