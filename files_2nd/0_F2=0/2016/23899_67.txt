These policies are designed to reduce the financial risks being faced, which primarily relate to credit, interest, liquidity and currency risks, and arise in the normal course of business.
Credit risk Financial instruments which potentially expose Fidessa to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
The largest customer accounts for less than 5% of revenue and the 10 largest customers account for less than 30% of revenue.
Cash equivalents are deposited only with major financial institutions that satisfy certain credit criteria as specified in Fidessas treasury policy.
The policy limits the maximum deposit with a counterparty and the maximum duration of a deposit.
The trade receivables as at 31st December are aged as in the table below.
2016 2015 000 000 Not due 49,097 46,935 Not more than three months past due 12,954 11,311 More than three months but not more than six months past due 2,346 1,256 More than six months past due 2,350 1,209 Total trade receivables 66,747 60,711 Material trade receivable balances relate to sales transactions with financial institutions.
Credit to customers is provided in the normal course of business and the amount that appears in the balance sheet is net of an allowance for specific doubtful receivables, the allowance generally being due to concerns regarding a customers solvency or the age of a receivable.
Allowances are made when the settlement of a receivable becomes doubtful and the potential exposure is not covered by a related amount in deferred revenue.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful receivables is in the table below.

Interest receivable and payable Fidessa holds net funds and hence its interest risks are associated with short-term cash deposits.
The overall objective with respect to these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of the funds, accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
In practice, this means that deposits are unlikely to be made with a maturity date greater than three months.
All deposits are at current market rates.
There are no borrowings due to the cash reserves and strong cash generation of the business.
Foreign currency risk Fidessa operates internationally and is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and on the translation of the balance sheet and income statement of foreign operations into sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the United States dollar and the Japanese yen.
Revenue is split 57% in US dollars, 28% in sterling, 6% in yen and 9% in other currencies.
The trade debtor currency exposure is consistent with the split of revenue by currency.
In managing currency risks the aim is to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the cash inflows and outflows in a foreign currency.
There are both cash inflows and outflows in these currencies that create a high level of natural hedge.
Hedging contracts have not been entered into for cash positions denominated in foreign currencies.
Over the longer term, permanent changes in foreign exchange would have an impact on consolidation of foreign subsidiaries earnings.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in the value of sterling against other currencies would have decreased the profit before tax by approximately 227,000 for the year ended 31st December 2016 2015: 208,000.
