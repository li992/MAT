Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2016 14.
VALUATION OF INVESTMENT PROPERTY continued Immature stores: value uncertainty continued C&W consider this approach to be a valuation assumption but not a Special Assumption, the latter being an assumption that assumes facts that differ from the actual facts existing at the valuation date and which, if not adopted, could produce a material difference in value.
As noted above, C&W have not assumed that the entire portfolio of properties owned by the entity would be sold as a single lot and the value for the whole portfolio in the context of a sale as a single lot may differ significantly from the aggregate of the individual values for each property in the portfolio, reflecting the lotting assumption described above.
Valuation assumption for purchasers costs The Groups investment property assets have been valued for the purposes of the financial statements after deducting notional purchasers cost of circa 6.1% to 6.8% of gross value, as if they were sold directly as property assets.
The valuation is an asset valuation which is entirely linked to the operating performance of the business.
The assets would have to be sold with the benefit of operational contracts, employment contracts and customer contracts, which would be very difficult to achieve except in a corporate structure.
This approach follows the logic of the valuation methodology in that the valuation is based on a capitalisation of the net operating income after allowing a deduction for operational cost and an allowance for central administration costs.
Sale in a corporate structure would result in a reduction in the assumed Stamp Duty Land Tax but an increase in other transaction costs reflecting additional due diligence resulting in a reduced notional purchasers cost of 2.75% of gross value.
All the significant sized transactions that have been concluded in the UK in recent years were completed in a corporate structure.
The Group therefore instructed C&W to carry out a Red Book valuation on the above basis, and this results in a higher property valuation at 31 March 2016 of 1,190.4 million 64.2 million higher than the value recorded in the financial statements.
The total valuations in the two Armadillo Partnerships performed by Jones Lang LaSalle are 2.1 million higher than the value recorded in the financial statements, of which the Groups share is 0.4 million.
The sum of these is 64.6 million and translates to 40.8 pence per share.
We have included this revised valuation in the adjusted diluted net asset calculation see note 14.
