2 Act 2015 and Finance Act 2016 provide for reductions in the main rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% for the financial year beginning 1 April 2017 and to 17% for the financial year beginning 1 April 2020.
UK deferred tax at the balance sheet date has been calculated at 17%.
Deferred tax in other territories has been calculated at enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when assets are realised or liabilities are settled.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
In addition to the amount charged to the income statement, the following amounts relating to tax have been recognised directly in other comprehensive income: 2016 2015 000 000 Deferred tax Arising on income and expenses recognised in other comprehensive income: Actuarial loss on defined benefit pension schemes 9,973 478 Total income tax charge recognised directly in other comprehensive income 9,973 478 In addition to the amount charged to the income statement and other comprehensive income, the following amounts relating to tax have been recognised directly in equity: 2016 2015 000 000 Current tax Excess tax deductions related to share-based payments on exercised options 124 - Deferred tax Change in estimated excess tax deductions related to share-based payments 167 12 Total income tax recognised directly in equity 43 12 The difference between the total current tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the profit before tax is as follows: 2016 2015 000 000 Group profit before tax 67,621 34,761 Tax on Group profit at standard UK corporation tax rate of 20.0% 2015: 20.25% 13,524 7,039 Tax effects of: Income expenses that are not taxable allowable in determining taxable profits 2,405 3,360 Effect of change in UK tax rate 5 1,353 Losses for which no deferred tax asset recognised 1,576 1,237 Change in unrecognised deferred tax assets - 1,799 Different tax rates of subsidiaries operating in other jurisdictions 2,683 528 CFC exemption 4,327 2,763 Non-taxable gain on disposal 1,835 - Patent Box 813 - Adjustments in respect of prior years 3,855 2,781 Tax expense for the year 9,363 9,772 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc.
Notes to accounts Group 109 11 Tax continued Included within the tax reconciliation are a number of non-recurring items, principally the non-taxable gain on the disposal of the ID business and the non-recognition of deferred tax assets for certain UK expenses.
In addition, a deferred tax asset was not recognised for certain expenses in our Canadian business and this will continue to be assessed annually.
The differences attributable to the UK CFC exemption, Patent Box and higher overseas tax rates are expected to recur in the future.
Prior year adjustments arise in all the major territories where the Group operates and for a variety of reasons.
Factors contributing to the increased prior year tax credit in 2016 include the identification of additional tax deductions and new claims for reliefs in the UK, the release of provisions against expiring uncertain tax positions and adjustments to deferred tax balances.

Notes to accounts Group 110 14 Goodwill 2016 2015 000 000 Cost At 1 January 428,166 348,598 Exchange differences 55,577 8,627 Recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries - 70,579 Derecognised on disposal see note 32 8,305 - Other changes 3,127 362 At 31 December 478,565 428,166 Accumulated impairment losses At 1 January 52,281 49,638 Exchange differences 10,691 2,643 Carrying amount at 31 December 415,593 375,885 Other changes in 2016 and 2015 relate to the re-assessment of initial fair values.
In 2016 this relates to Herley adjustments predominantly to inventory and provisions and to Furnace Parts adjustments to deferred tax balances.
The Groups , which represent Cash Generating Unit CGU groupings, are: Aerospace, Infrastructure, Nuclear, Communications, C2ISR, Maritime, Land and Underwater Warfare.
These represent the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Subsequent adjustments are made to this allocation to the extent operations, to which goodwill relates, are transferred between CGU groups.
The size of a CGU group varies but is never larger than a reportable operating segment.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
In determining the value-in-use for each CGU, the Group prepares cash flows derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plan, representing the best estimate of future performance.
These plans, which have been approved by the Board, include detailed financial forecasts and market analysis covering the expected development of each CGU over the next five years.
The cash flows for the following ten years are also included and assume a growth rate of 2.5% per annum.
Cash flows beyond that period are not included in the value-in-use calculation.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, future revenues, growth rates, forecast gross margins and underlying operating profit.
Management estimates the discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the Group, being the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
The WACC is then risk-adjusted to reflect risks specific to each business.
Future revenues are based on orders already received, opportunities that are known and expected at the time of setting the budget and strategic plans and future growth rates.
Budget and strategic plan growth rates are based on a combination of historic experience, available government spending data and management and industry expectations of the growth rates that are expected to apply in the major markets in which each CGU operates.
Longerterm growth rates, applied for the ten-year period after the end of the strategic planning period, are set at 2.5%.
Ultra considers the long-term growth rate to be appropriate for the sectors in which it operates.
Forecast gross margins reflect past experience, factor in expected efficiencies to counter inflationary pressures, and also reflect likely margins achievable in the shorter-term period of greater defence spending uncertainty.
Within each of the strategic plans a number of assumptions are made about business growth opportunities, contract wins, product development and available markets.
A key assumption is that there will be continued demand for Ultras products and expertise from a number of US government agencies and prime contractors during the strategic plan period.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value-in-use calculations to: i reduce the post-2021 growth assumption from 2.5% to nil: ii apply a 20% reduction to forecast operating profits in each year of the modelled cash inflows: and iii consider specific market factors as noted above.
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 see footnote on page 144 6.
Notes to accounts Group 111 14 Goodwill continued Certain of these sensitivity scenarios give rise to a potential impairment in Infrastructure.
Headroom, which represents the value derived from the key growth assumptions in the Infrastructure value-in-use calculations, is 5.2m.
Sensitivity ii results in a 1.5m impairment in Infrastructure: the CGU grouping is sensitive to the ability of the remaining operations to win sufficient new customers over the medium term.
For all other CGUs, the value-in-use calculations exceed the CGU carrying values in the sensitivity scenarios.
The amortisation of intangible assets charge is included within administrative expenses.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortised over their estimated useful lives, typically as follows: Customer relationships 5 to 21 years Intellectual property 5 to 10 years Profit in acquired order book 1 to 3 years Other acquired 1 to 5 years Development costs 2 to 10 years Other intangibles: 3 to 5 years Software 3 to 5 years Patents and trademarks 10 to 20 years Ultra Electronics Holdings plc.
Included within Land and Buildings is nil 2015: nil of assets in the course of construction.
17 Interest in associate 2016 2015 000 000 Total revenue of associate - 3,511 Groups share of loss recognised - 581 The Groups interest in associate was represented by its 49% holding of ordinary shares in Al Shaheen Adventure LLC ASA, a company incorporated in the UAE.
The Group had significant influence over the entity but did not control it, consequently ASA was accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
On 30 December 2015, the Group reached agreement to transfer the whole of its 49% equity interest in ASA to Emirates Advanced Investments Group EAI.
During 2015 Ultra received an interim cash dividend of 5,343,000 and received a further final dividend of 3,111,000 in January 2017 which will be accounted for in 2017.
A non-underlying impairment charge of 2,693,000 was recorded in 2015 as disclosed in note 6.

The average credit period on sale of goods is 36 days 2015: 28 days.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
The ageing profile of unprovided overdue trade receivables was as follows: Related Related 2016 provision Total 2015 provision Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 1 to 3 months 15,765 157 15,608 20,039 315 19,724 4 to 6 months 1,968 56 1,912 1,067 76 991 7 to 9 months 434 72 362 591 276 315 Over 9 months 1,666 1,022 644 292 292 - Total overdue 19,833 1,307 18,526 21,989 959 21,030 The Group provides against its trade receivables where there are serious doubts as to future recoverability based on prior experience, on assessment of the current economic climate and on the length of time that the receivable has been overdue.
All trade receivables that have been overdue for more than a year are provided for in full.
Notes to accounts Group 114 20 Trade and other receivables continued Movement in the provision for trade receivables was as follows: 2016 2015 Current 000 000 Balance at beginning of year 959 1,043 Foreign exchange differences 105 24 Increase in provision for trade receivables regarded as potentially uncollectable 633 217 Decrease in provision for trade receivables recovered during the year 390 277 Balance at end of year 1,307 959 2016 2015 Non-current 000 000 Balance at beginning of year - 6,884 Decrease in provision for trade receivables regarded as potentially uncollectable - 6,884 Balance at end of year - - Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group mitigates this risk of financial loss by only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Whilst the Group has elements of concentration of credit risk, with exposure to a number of large counter parties and customers, the customers are mainly government agencies or multi-national organisations with whom the Group has long-term business relationships.
The Group has a small number of customers with individually significant amounts outstanding.
These customers are considered to have low credit risk.

Notes to accounts Group 115 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management Derivative financial instruments Exposure to currency and interest rate risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to all significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted unadjusted active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that includes inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of Ultras financial instruments have been assessed as Level 2.

Notes to accounts Group 116 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Liquidity risk The Group maintains committed banking facilities with core banks to provide prudent levels of borrowing headroom.
The Groups banking facilities are provided by a small group of banks, led by The Royal Bank of Scotland.
During the year there were three facilities in place.
The first provides 100 million of revolving credit and expires in August 2019.
The second facility, which was put in place in August 2014, provides 200 million of revolving credit which expires in August 2019.
Both facilities are denominated in Sterling, US Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Euros and are used for balance sheet and operational needs.
A US$225m term loan facility, which expires in August 2019, was put in place at the time of the Herley acquisition.
The same covenants are in place across the three facilities.
A further 15 million overdraft is available for short-term working capital funding.
All bank loans are unsecured.
Interest was predominantly charged at 1.35% 2015: 1.00% over base or contracted rate.
At 31 December 2016, the Group had available 213,000,000 2015: 159,756,000 of undrawn, committed borrowing facilities.
The Group is strongly cash-generative and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally to fund short-term local working capital requirements.
Where additional funding is required, this is provided centrally through the Groups committed banking facilities.
The Group, through its Canadian subsidiary Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems UETCS, participates in two Canadian programmes that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products.
Further disclosure is provided in note 24.
The Group has a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. US$10m of loan notes were issued in 2011 with a maturity date of July 2018 and a further US$60m of loan notes were issued in January 2012 with a maturity date of January 2019.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 22, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Currency risk The Group uses currency derivatives in the form of forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency transaction risk.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollars and Canadian Dollars.
At 31 December 2016, the net fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be a liability of approximately 23,847,000 2015: liability 4,744,000, comprising 254,000 assets 2015: 1,347,000 and 24,101,000 liabilities 2015: 6,091,000.
The loss on derivative financial instruments included in the Groups consolidated income statement for the period was 19,103,000 2015: loss 3,988,000.
Notes to accounts Group 117 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued The net notional, or net contracted, amounts of foreign currency related forward sales contracts, classified by year of maturity are shown below.

The value of the borrowings does not exceed the net investments, meeting the conditions required to qualify as effective hedges.
The value of the net investment hedge was US$295m 2015: US$325m.
Interest rate risk The Group holds interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
The interest rate swaps, denominated in US dollars, have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.
The swaps mature in July 2019 and have a fixed swap rate, including the bank margin, of 1.232%.
The floating rates are US Dollar LIBOR.
At the year end the nominal amounts of the interest rate swaps were US$120m 2015: US$120m.
The hedging contracts fix US$120m of borrowings to 30 December 2016, reducing to US$90m by December 2017, US$60m by December 2018 and US$45m by July 2019.
The interest rate swaps were designated effective cash flow hedges and the change in fair value is charged to equity.
At 31 December 2016, the net fair value of interest rate swaps was 315,000 2015: 198,000.
The amount recycled from the income statement during the year was 495,000 and has been charged to interest cost in the year 2015: nil.
The fair value will be realised in the income statement on a quarterly basis over the next 2.5 years.
The Group also has US$70m of fixed rate debt with Pricoa at an interest rate of 3.60%, due for repayment in July 2018 and January 2019.
The interest rate swaps and fixed rate Pricoa debt were entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.
The effective interest rates and repricing dates of the Groups financial assets and liabilities were as follows: Effective Within interest Total 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years 5 years rate 000 000 000 000 000 2016 Cash and cash equivalents 0.36% 74,625 74,625 --- Loan notes 3.60% 56,897 - 8,128 48,769 - Unsecured bank loans 2.09% 268,120 - 48,769 219,351 - Government loans 4.43% 6,308 --- 6,308 2015 Cash and cash equivalents 0.43% 45,474 45,474 --- Loan notes 3.60% 47,236 -- 47,236 - Unsecured bank loans 1.69% 289,521 -- 289,521 - Government loans 4.43% 4,289 --- 4,289 Market risk sensitivity analysis Interest rate risk During 2016 the Groups net borrowings were predominantly at floating interest rates.
The Group has estimated the impact on the income statement of a 1% increase in market interest rates, from the average rates applicable during 2016.
There is no significant difference between the amount recharged to the income statement and equity in the year.

Under the Strategic Aerospace and Defence Initiative SADI, the Canadian Federal Government provides a long-term funding arrangement in respect of certain eligible research and development project costs.
Under this arrangement, up to $32m will be provided to UETCS and reimbursed at favourable rates of interest.
Up to $8m will be provided to UEMS and reimbursed at favourable rates of interest over the period 2020 to 2033.
The benefit of the below-market rate of interest has been calculated as the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of the loans and has been credited to profit in the year.
The fair value of the loans has been calculated using a market interest rate for a similar instrument.
Following delays on some of the UETCS programme, a two-year extension of the project competition date to December 2017 and related repayments to 2032 has been agreed with Industry Canada.
The revised repayment profile and reassessment of the discount rate resulted in a reduction of the loan element and an increase in the grant element during 2015 and a reduction in capitalised development in 2015.
UETCS also participates in the Investissement Quebec IQ research and development programme, whereby IQ shares in the cost of research and development of certain specified new products.
Under this arrangement IQ will finance up to $14m of eligible costs associated with these specified projects.
This funding is repayable under a royalty arrangement over the period 2014 to 2021 if these products are successfully brought to market.
Royalties only become payable when sales of these products are made.
As there is no minimum repayment, funding received in respect of the IQ programme has been included in the income statement.
Amounts recognised in the financial statements in respect of these programmes were as follows: 2016 2015 000 000 Fair value of SADI loan brought forward 4,289 5,728 Contributions 262 662 Reassessment as grant income - 2,249 Reduction in capitalised development - 784 Interest charged to finance costs 837 953 Foreign exchange differences 920 21 Fair value of SADI loan carried forward 6,308 4,289 Government grants credited to profit in the year 2016 2015 000 000 SADI 1,663 3,551 Other - 163 1,663 3,714 Ultra Electronics Limited received a 163,000 grant from the Technology Strategy Board in 2015.
Notes to accounts Group 119 25 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting period.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets, in excess of offsetting deferred tax liabilities, are recognised for tax loss carry forwards and deductible temporary differences to the extent that utilisation against future taxable profits is probable.
UK deferred tax assets of 1.4m and Canadian deferred tax assets of 12.0m have not been recognised 2015: 11.3m because their recovery is uncertain.
The absence of any consolidated or group basis of taxation in Canada contributes significantly to the uncertainty over the recovery of the Canadian deferred tax asset.
Such costs are generally incurred within two years after delivery.
Contract related provisions will be utilised over the period as stated in the contract to which the specific provision relates.
Other provisions include re-organisation costs, contingent consideration, dilapidation costs and provisions associated with the Oman Airport IT contract termination.
Dilapidations will be payable at the end of the contracted life which is up to fifteen years.
Contingent consideration is payable when earnings targets are met: 1,598,000 of the provision was utilised in the year when the final Forensic Technology earn-out target was met.

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price.
Share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year.
The weighted average share price during the year was 18.07.
The fair value of options granted during the year that are expected to vest was 2,969,796 2015: 2,878,631.
Notes to accounts Group 122 27 Share capital and share options continued The Groups equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value for all schemes other than the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 March LTIP schemes are measured by use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2016 Weighted average share price 17.25 17.34 16.99 17.56 Weighted average exercise price 15.51 17.39 16.96 n a Expected volatility % 21.3 23.3 24.4 18.4 Expected option life years 3.6 653 Risk-free interest rate % 0.7 1.5 1.7 0.6 Expected dividends % 2.5 2.4 2.3 0.0 Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2015 Weighted average share price 17.04 17.40 17.41 17.10 Weighted average exercise price 15.89 17.36 17.38 n a Expected volatility % 22.4 25.0 24.2 18.7 Expected option life years 3.5 653 Risk-free interest rate % 0.8 1.6 1.2 0.7 Expected dividends % 2.4 1.8 2.3 0.0 Figures in the above table show an average across the invested schemes at year end.
For the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 March LTIP awards, the stochastic model has been used to calculate the fair value of the awards at grant date as this is the most accurate way of modelling the TSR performance condition.
The fair value of these schemes has been calculated using the following assumptions: 2016 2015 Exercise price n a n a Share price at grant 17.63 17.79 Expected option life years 3.0 3.0 Expected volatility % 20.5 21.9 Risk-free interest rate % 0.6 0.7 Figures in the above table show an average across the schemes.

The scheme is a final salary scheme with the majority of members accruing 1 60th of their final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service.
The scheme was closed to new members in 2003.
A defined contribution plan was introduced for other employees and new joiners in the UK.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2016.
Following a consultation period and discussions with the Trustee, the UK defined benefit scheme was closed to future benefit accrual from 5 April 2016.
The Group also operates two defined contribution schemes for overseas employees.
In addition to these schemes, the Groups Tactical Communication Systems business based in Montreal, Canada, has three defined benefit schemes and the Swiss business of the Forensic Technology group has a defined benefit scheme.
Defined contribution schemes The total cost charged to income in respect of the defined contribution schemes was 8,837,000 2015: 7,610,000.
Defined benefit schemes All the defined benefit schemes were actuarially assessed at 31 December 2016 using the projected unit method.
In the UK, Ultra Electronics Limited sponsors the Ultra Electronics Pension Scheme, a funded defined benefit pension scheme.
The scheme is administered within a trust which is legally separate from the Company.
Trustees are appointed by both the Company and the schemes membership and act in the interest of the scheme and all relevant stakeholders, including the members and the Company.
The Trustees are also responsible for the investment of the schemes assets.
This scheme provides pensions and lump sums to members on retirement and to their dependants on death.
Members who leave service before retirement are entitled to a deferred pension.
Active members of the scheme pay contributions via salary sacrifice and the Company pays the balance of the cost as determined by regular actuarial valuations.
The Trustees are required to use prudent assumptions to value the liabilities and costs of the scheme whereas the accounting assumptions must be best estimates.
Responsibility for making good any deficit within the scheme lies with the Company and this introduces a number of risks for the Company.
The major risks are: interest rate risk, inflation risk, investment risk and longevity risk.
The Company and Trustees are aware of these risks and manage them through appropriate investment and funding strategies.
The Trustees manage governance and operational risks through a number of internal controls policies, including a risk register.
The scheme is subject to regular actuarial valuations, which are usually carried out every three years.
The last actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 6 April 2016.
This valuation has been finalised and will result in an increase in the additional deficit payment required to 9.5m in 2017, 10.0m in 2018, 10.5m in 2019 and 11.0m per annum for the following five years.
The next actuarial valuation is due to be carried out with an effective date of 6 April 2019.
These actuarial valuations are carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Pensions Act 2004 and so include deliberate margins for prudence.
This contrasts with these accounting disclosures, which are determined using best estimate assumptions.
The results of the 6 April 2016 valuation have been projected to 31 December 2016 by a qualified independent actuary.
The figures in the following disclosure were measured using the Projected Unit Method.
Key financial assumptions used in the valuation of these schemes were as follows: UK Canada Switzerland UK Canada Switzerland 2016 2016 2016 2015 2015 2015 Discount rate 2.55% 3.50% 0.35% 3.75% 3.75% 0.80% Inflation rate RPI 3.30% 3.30% 0.80% 3.05% 3.05% 0.80% Inflation rate CPI 2.30% 2.30% 0.80% 2.05% 2.05% 0.80% Expected rate of salary increases n a 3.55% 1.00% 3.30% 3.30% 1.00% Future pension increases pre 6 4 08 3.05% n a n a 2.85% n a n a Future pension increases post 6 4 08 1.95% n a n a 1.90% n a n a Ultra Electronics Holdings plc.
Notes to accounts Group 125 31 Retirement benefit schemes continued For each of these assumptions there is a range of possible values.
Relatively small changes in some of these variables can have a significant impact on the level of the total obligation.
For the UK scheme, a 0.1% increase in the inflation assumption to 3.40% and a 0.1% decrease in the discount rate to 2.45% would increase the schemes liabilities by 1.8% and 2.0% respectively.
If the members life expectancy were to increase by 1 year, the scheme liabilities would increase by 3.9%.
The average duration of the scheme liabilities is 20 years 2015: 20 years.
The key demographic assumption used was in relation to the mortality rates of current and future pensioners.
Due to the size of the scheme the mortality rates were based on standard tables, namely: Current pensioners 100% SAPS S2PMA L 84% SAPS S2PFA L c2007 CMI 2015 1.25% imps from 2007 UK only Future pensioners 100% SAPS S2PMA L 84% SAPS S2PFA L c2007 CMI 2015 1.25% imps from 2007 UK only The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the UK scheme make appropriate allowance for future improvements in longevity and are set out below: 2016 2015 Current pensioners at 65 males 23 years 22 years Current pensioners at 65 females 26 years 24 years Future pensioners at 65 males 25 years 24 years Future pensioners at 65 females 28 years 26 years Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes were as follows: UK Canada Switzerland Total UK Canada Switzerland Total 2016 2016 2016 2016 2015 2015 2015 2015 m m m m m m m m Current service cost 1.3 0.1 0.2 1.6 4.9 0.1 0.3 5.3 Administration expenses 0.6 0.2 - 0.8 0.5 0.1 - 0.6 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 11.4 0.3 0.1 11.8 11.2 0.3 0.1 11.6 Curtailment gain 15.5 - - 15.5 ---- Expected return on pension scheme assets 8.4 0.4 - 8.8 8.2 0.3 0.1 8.6 Charge credit 10.6 0.2 0.3 10.1 8.4 0.2 0.3 8.9 Of the current service cost for the year, 1.0 million 2015: 3.9 million has been included in cost of sales, and 0.6 million 2015: 1.4 million has been included in administrative expenses.

Sales to Group companies were 496,000.
The following table summarises the information, before any intra-group eliminations, relating to the Groups former subsidiary Ultra Electronics in Collaboration with Oman Investment Corporation, incorporated in the Sultanate of Oman, that had a material non-controlling interest held by Oman Investment Corporation OIC.
On 4 March 2015 the entity was placed into voluntary liquidation and no longer meets the IFRS 10 criteria for consolidation as a subsidiary of the Group see note 7.
2016 2015 Ithra 000 000 Non-controlling interest percentage -% -% Profit allocated to non-controlling interest - - Loss incurred by Ultra upon deemed disposal of Ithra - 13,751 Other comprehensive income allocated to non-controlling interest - 128 35 Contingent liabilities The Group has entered into a number of guarantee and performance bond arrangements in the normal course of business totalling 40.3m 2015: 70.6m.
The nature of much of the contracting work performed by the Group means that there are occasional contractual issues, variations and renegotiations that arise.
In addition, the Group is, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
In particular, as set out in note 7, the Oman Airport IT contract was terminated in February 2015.
This has given rise to significant uncertainty regarding the likely outcome of proceedings in respect of this termination event, and it is not possible to reliably estimate the outcome.
