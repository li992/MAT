In assessing the adequacy of its capital resources, the Group considers its risk appetite, the material risks to which it is exposed and the appropriate strategies required to manage those risks.
The Group prepares an annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process document that sets out how Metro Bank identifies and manages the key risks to which it is exposed and details the Groups capital requirements, capital resources and capital adequacy over the planning period.
The Group produces regular reports on the current and forecasted level of capital, as well as the results of stress scenarios, to the Board and the Executive Leadership Team chaired by the Chief Executive Officer.
The key assumptions and risk drivers used to create the stress tests are regularly monitored and reported.
