Long term incentive plan The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP is open to Executive Directors and designated senior managers, and awards are made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Awards are subject to market and non-market performance criteria.
Awards granted under the LTIP vest subject to achievement of performance conditions measured over a period of at least three years, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
Awards may be in the form of conditional share awards or nil-cost options or any other form allowed by the Plan rules.
Vesting of awards will be dependent on a range of financial, operational or share price measures, as set by the Committee, which are aligned with the long-term strategic objectives of the Group and shareholder value creation.
Not less than 30% of an award will be based on share price measures.
The remainder will be based on either financial and or operational measures.
At the threshold performance, no more than 25% of the award will vest, rising to 100% for maximum performance.
For awards granted in 2017, vesting will be based on EPS 35%, relative TSR 35% and Operational Excellence 30% targets.
The details of measures, targets and weightings may be varied by the Committee prior to grant based on the Groups strategic objectives.
Deferred bonus plan The Deferred Bonus Plan is a discretionary executive share bonus plan under which the Remuneration Committee determines that a proportion of a participants annual bonus will be deferred.
The market value of the shares granted to any employee will be equal to one-third of the total annual bonus that would otherwise have been payable to the individual.
The awards will be granted on the day after the announcement of the Groups annual results.
The awards will normally vest over a three-year period.
