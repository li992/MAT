In 2015, the Group used 38 million of previously unrecognised tax losses against taxable profits reducing the prior year current tax charge.
The uncertainties preventing recognition of these losses will not be resolved until 2017 at the earliest and a corresponding provision was created against their use.
Management tax rate The tax charge arising on management profits of subsidiaries of 605 million 2015: 544 million was 144 million 2015: 133 million giving an effective tax rate of 24% 2015: 24%.
GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 137 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2016 6 Taxation continued a Tax expense continued Judgements and estimates The Group operates in many jurisdictions and is subject to tax audits which are often complex and can take several years to conclude.
Therefore, the accrual for current tax includes provisions for uncertain tax positions which require estimates for each matter and the exercise of judgement in respect of the interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of challenge to historical tax positions.
Management uses in-house tax experts, professional advisers and previous experience when assessing tax risks.
Where appropriate, estimates of interest and penalties are included in these provisions.
As amounts provided for in any year could differ from eventual tax liabilities, subsequent adjustments which have a material impact on the Groups tax rate and or cash tax payments may arise.
Tax payments comprise payments on account and payments on the final resolution of open items and, as a result, there can be substantial differences between the charge in the income statement and cash tax payments.
Where companies utilise brought forward tax losses such that little or no tax is paid, this also results in differences between the tax charge and cash tax payments.
With regard to deferred tax, judgement is required for the recognition of deferred tax assets, which is based on expectations of future financial performance in particular legal entities or tax groups.

These territories have both recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where, based on management projections, the future availability of taxable profits to absorb the deductions before any applicable time limits expire is probable.
Deferred tax assets including tax losses are not recognised where the Groups ability to utilise them is not probable, for example where management projections indicate there will be insufficient future profits before losses expire, or in cases where the quantum of losses is uncertain i. e. subject to cases such as the FII GLO.
Other deferred tax arises mainly in relation to items that are taxable or tax deductible in a different period than the income or expense is accrued in the financial statements.
Other deferred tax assets include 139 million relating to derivatives 2015: 85 million.
e Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets that have not been recognised are shown below.

If these earnings were remitted in full, tax of 41 million 2015: 18 million would be payable.
