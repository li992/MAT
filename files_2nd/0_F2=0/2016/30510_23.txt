Retirement benefit obligations WH Smith PLC has operated a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
The main pension arrangements for employees are operated through a defined benefit scheme, WHSmith Pension Trust, and a defined contribution scheme, WHSmith Retirement Savings Plan.
The most significant scheme is WHSmith Pension Trust, which is described in Note 4 a i.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet within non-current liabilities for the respective schemes at the relevant reporting dates were: m 2016 2015 WHSmith Pension Trust 5 5 United News Shops Retirement Benefits Scheme 2 1 Retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet 7 6 Recognised as: Current liabilities 1 1 Non-current liabilities 6 5 a Defined benefit pension schemes i The WHSmith Pension Trust The WHSmith Pension Trust Final Salary Section is a funded final salary defined benefit scheme: it was closed to defined benefit service accrual on 2 April 2007 and has been closed to new members since 1996.
Benefits are based on service and salary at the date of closure or leaving service, with increases currently based on CPI inflation in deferment and RPI inflation in payment.
WH Smith PLC Strategic Corporate Financial Other Annual report and accounts 2016 77 report governance statements information 4.
Retirement benefit obligations continued The WHSmith Pension Trust is independent of the Group and is administered by a Trustee.
The Trustee is responsible for the administration and management of the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the Trust Deed and relevant legislation.
Responsibilities include the investment of funds, the triennial valuation and determining the deficit funding schedule.
Under the terms ofthe Trust Deed there are ten Trustee directors of which three are appointed by the Sponsor, four are member-nominated directors, andthree are independent.
Trustee directors are appointed for a term of six years, and are then eligible for re-appointment.
The WHSmith Pension Trust, has assets valued at 1,424m as at 31 August 2016 managed by third party investment managers.
In September 2005, the Pension Trust Trustee adopted a Liability Driven Investment LDI policy where the assets in the investment fund were invested such that they are expected to alter in value in line with changes in the pension liability caused by changes in interest rates and inflation.
The LDI structure that is in place has a number of inflation and interest rate hedges and equity option agreements, with collateral posted daily to or from the scheme to the relevant counterparty.
The risk of failure of counterparties could expose the scheme to loss.
The schemes liabilities are also subject to changes in longevity.
The principal risks associated with the Groups defined benefit pension arrangements are as follows: Longevity risk Liabilities are sensitive to life expectancy, with increases in life expectancy leading to an increase in the valuation of liabilities.
Interest rate and Inflation risk Liabilities are sensitive to movements in interest rates and inflation, with lower interest rates or higher inflation leading to an increase inthe valuation of liabilities.
As a result of the LDI policy outlined above, these risks are largely hedged.
An Investment Committee of the Trustees to the scheme meets regularly to review the performance of the investment managers and the scheme as a whole.
The Company is represented on this Committee.
Although investment decisions are the responsibility of the Trustee, the Group is an active participant of the investment sub-committee to ensure that pension plan risks are managed efficiently The risk of failure of counterparties and of the investment manager is monitored regularly by the Committee.
The Trustees have the right to determine the level of contributions and the Company has agreed with the Trustees a deficit funding schedule.
A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the Pension Trust was carried out as at 31 March 2014 by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
At 31 March 2014 the deficit was 24m, and a revised deficit funding schedule of approximately 3m per annum was agreed with the Trustee, with effect from 1 October 2014 for the following nine years.
With effect from 1 September 2015 the Group agreed to pay certain investment management costs directly.
The annual deficit funding agreement is around 1m per annum with effect from 1 September 2015.
During the year ending 31 August 2016, the Group made a contribution of 3m to the WHSmith Pension Trust 2015: 4m in accordance with the agreed pension deficit funding schedule, being 1m of deficit funding payable to the Trustee and 2m in relation to investment management costs.

Management has determined that no impairment was necessary for the current financial year 2015: nil.
All goodwill relates to the acquisitions of groups of retail stores and each CGU is sensitive to movements in the same key assumptions.
The key assumptions on which forecast three-year cash flows of the CGUs are based include sales growth, product mix and operating costs.
The values assigned to each of these assumptions were determined based on the extrapolation of historical trends within the Group, and external information on expected future trends in the UK retail industry.
These cash flows are extrapolated for up to an additional nine years representing the average length of the lease for the relevant group of stores based on estimated long-term growth rates of between 0 and 2.5 per cent.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows was ten per cent pre-tax 2015: ten per cent.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by management.
This included an increase in the discount rate of up to one per cent and a decrease in the long-term growth rate of up to one per cent.
The sensitivity analysis showed that no impairment would arise under each scenario.

Other intangible assets Other intangible assets comprise capitalised software costs that are not deemed to be an integral part of the related hardware whichisclassified within property, plant and equipment and certain tenancy rights.
The amortisation period for capitalised software costs is over a maximum period of five years.
Other intangible assets are either considered to have an indefinite life, therefore no amortisation has been charged, or are amortised over their useful economic life.
These assets are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment.

Included in other intangible assets are certain assets considered to have an indefinite life, 4m 2015: 4m, representing certain rights under tenancy agreements, which include the right to renew leases.
Management has determined that the useful economic life of these assets is indefinite because the Company can continue to occupy and trade from certain premises for an indefinite period.

Contingent liabilities and capital commitments m 2016 2015 Bank and other loans guaranteed 6 6 Other potential liabilities that could crystallise are in respect of previous assignments of leases where the liability could revert to the Group if the lessee defaulted.
Pursuant to the terms of the Demerger Agreement with Connect Group PLC formerly Smiths News PLC, any such contingent liability which becomes an actual liability, will be apportioned between the Group and Connect Group PLC in the ratio 65:35 provided that the actual liability of Connect Group PLC in any 12-month period does not exceed 5m.
The Groups 65 per cent share of these leases has an estimated future rental commitment at 31 August 2016 of 3m 2015: 4m.
The movement in the future rental commitment is due to the crystallisation of lease liabilities, lease expiries and the effluxion of time.

Risk management The Groups treasury function seeks to reduce exposures to interest rate, foreign exchange and other financial risks, and to ensure liquidity is available to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
The Group does not engage in speculative trading in financial instruments and transacts only in relation to underlying business requirements.
The Groups treasury policies and procedures are periodically reviewed and approved by the Groups Audit Committee and are subject to regular Group Internal Audit review.
WH Smith PLC 90 Annual report and accounts 2016 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 23.
Financial instruments continued Capital risk The Groups objectives with respect to managing capital defined as net debt funds plus equity are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, in order to optimise returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
Refer to Note 20 for the value of the Groups net debt funds and refer to the Group statement of changes in equity for the value of the Groups equity.
In managing the Groups capital levels the Board regularly monitors the level of debt in the business, the working capital requirements, forecast financing and investing cash flows.
Based on this analysis, the Board determines the appropriate return to investors while ensuring sufficient capital is retained in the business to meet its strategic objectives.
The Board has a progressive dividend policy and expects that, over time, dividends would be broadly covered twice by earnings calculated on a normalised tax basis.
As at 13 October 2016 the Group has in place a 93.3m committed multi-currency revolving credit facility, carrying certain financial covenants which have been met throughout the period.
The covenants, tested half-yearly, are based on fixed charges cover and net borrowings.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by reviewing the cash resources required to meet its business objectives through both short and long-term cash flow forecasts.
The Group has a five-year committed multi-currency revolving credit facility with a number offinancial institutions which is available to be drawn for general corporate purposes including working capital.
The Group has a policy of pooling cash flows in order to optimise the return on surplus cash and also to utilise cash within the Group to reduce the costs of external short-term funding.
The table below shows the maturity analysis of the undiscounted remaining contractual cash flows of the Groups financial liabilities: Due within Due between Due between Due over 2016 m 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years Total Non-derivative financial liabilities Bank loans and overdrafts 18 18 Trade and other payables 242 242 Finance leases 3 3 8 14 Total cash flows 263 3 8 274 Due within Due between Due between Due over 2015 m 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years Total Non-derivative financial liabilities Bank loans and overdrafts 9 9 Trade and other payables 258 1 259 Finance leases 2 2 6 1 11 Total cash flows 269 3 6 1 279 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty may default on their obligation to the Group in relation to lending, hedging, settlement and other financial activities.
The Groups principal financial assets are trade and other receivables and bank balances and cash.
The Group has credit risk attributable to its trade and other receivables including a number of sale or return contracts with suppliers.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The Group has low retail credit risk due to the transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with the exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is considered to be low, as the Board approved Group treasury policy limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
These limits are based on a combination of short-term credit ratings of P-1 and long-term ratings of A2 or better.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Group does not hold collateral over any of these financial assets.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
At 31 August 2016, the Group had drawn down 18m 2015: 9m from its committed revolving credit facility.
The Group draws down on its facility, but does not view any draw down as long-term in nature and therefore does not enter into interest rate derivatives to mitigate this risk.

Financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk Foreign exchange rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of the changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups foreign currency exposures are principally to the US dollar, euro and Australian dollar.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The hedging instruments have been used to hedge purchases in US dollars and to minimise foreign exchange risk in movements of the USD GBP exchange rates.
These are designated as cash flow hedges.
At 31 August 2016, the Group had no material un-hedged currency exposures.
The Groups euro and Australian dollar exposure is principally operational and arises mainly through the operation of retail stores in France, Ireland, Spain and Australia.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposure.
Forward foreign exchange contracts have been used to hedge France and Ireland retail stores purchases in GBP to minimise foreign exchange risk in movements of the GBP EUR exchange rates.
The fair value of cash flow hedges recognised on the balance sheet within derivative assets liabilities is shown below: m 2016 2015 Fair value of derivative assets 2 At 31 August 2016, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the Group has committed is US$30m 2015: US$31m and 4m 2015:nil.
These instruments will be used to hedge cash flows occurring within up to two years of the balance sheet date.
Gains totalling nil 2015: nil have been transferred to both the income statement and inventories in respect of contracts that matured during the year ended 31 August 2016.
In the year to 31 August 2016, the fair value gain on the Groups currency derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges amounted to 2m 2015: nil.
All the derivatives held by the Group at fair value are considered to have fair values determined by level 2 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy of IFRS 13, Fair value measurement.
There are no non-recurring fair value measurements nor have there been any transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
Sensitivity analysis as at 31 August 2016 Financial instruments affected by market risks include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates, and USD GBP, EUR GBP and AUD GBP exchange rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash flow hedge relationship affect the hedging reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives.
Group debt and hedging activities remain constant, reflecting the positions at 31 August 2016 and 31 August 2015 respectively.
As aconsequence, the analysis relates to the position at those dates and is not necessarily representative of the years then ended.
The above assumptions are made when illustrating the effect on the Groups income statement and equity given reasonable movements in foreign exchange and interest rates before the effect of tax.
The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement in GBP LIBOR base rate to be one per cent, based on interest rate history.
Similarly, sensitivity to movements in USD GBP, EUR GBP and AUD GBP exchange rates of ten per cent are shown, reflecting changes of reasonable proportion in the context of movement in those currency pairs over time.
Using these assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Group income statement and equity.
