The schemes hold a significant proportion of growth assets equities and diversified growth funds which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, but can give rise to volatility and risk in the short-term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored such that it is suitable with the schemes long-term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the schemes liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk The majority of the schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
In conjunction with its investment advisers, the trustees have structured the schemes investments with the objective of balancing investment returns and levels of risk.
The asset allocation for the main scheme has three principal elements: holding of cash funds and bonds which are expected to be less volatile than most other asset classes and reflects market movements in the schemes liabilities a proportion of equities, with fund managers having freedom in making investment decisions to maximise returns investment of a proportion of the schemes assets in alternative asset classes which give the potential for diversification currently property and diversified growth.
The liabilities of the defined benefit schemes are measured by using the projected unit credit method which is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected increases in pensionable pay.
The future cash flows arising from the payment of the defined benefits are expected to be settled primarily in the period between 15 and 40 years from the balance sheet date.
The last triennial actuarial valuation of the principal defined benefit scheme was at 31 March 2013.
The Group has made a deficit recovery contribution of 23.7 million to the main scheme during the year 2015 11.0 million.
The Group monitors funding levels on an annual basis and expects to pay total contributions of around 10 million during the year ended 31 March 2017. www.
