LOANS AND ADVANCES TO BANKS AND CUSTOMERS continued Accounting policy Sale and repurchase agreements: Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements repos remain on the balance sheet, the counterparty liability is included in deposits by banks or customer accounts, as appropriate.
Securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse-repos are recorded as loans and advances to other banks or customers, as appropriate.
The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method.
Securities lent to counterparties are also retained in the financial statements.
Securities borrowed are not recognised in the financial statements, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the purchase and sale are recorded with the gain or loss included in trading income.
Derecognition: Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
If substantially all the risks and rewards have been neither retained nor transferred and the Group has retained control, the assets continue to be recognised to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished.
A financial liability is extinguished when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
If the Group purchases its own debt, it is removed from the balance sheet and the difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the consideration paid is included in Other income.
Repos and securities borrowing and lending transactions: These transactions typically entitle the Group and its counterparties to have recourse to assets similar to those provided as collateral in the event of a default.
Securities sold subject to repos, either by way of a Global Master Repurchase Agreement GMRA, or through a securities sale and TRS continue to be recognised on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially the associated risks and rewards of the securities, the TRS is not recognised.
The counterparty liability is included in deposits by banks or customer accounts, as appropriate.
Assets sold under repurchase agreements are considered encumbered as the Group cannot pledge these to obtain funding.
The table below sets out the financial assets provided as collateral for repurchase transactions.

LOANS AND ADVANCES TO BANKS AND CUSTOMERS continued Reverse repurchase agreements The Group also undertakes reverse repurchase reverse repo lending agreements with counterparties, typically financial institutions, in exchange for collateral.
Reverse repo agreements entitle the Group to have recourse to assets similar to those received as collateral in the event of a default.
In addition the Group also obtains collateral on terms that permit the Group to repledge or resell the collateral to others.
The Group does not recognise the securities bought under reverse repos as collateral on its balance sheet as the Group is not substantially entitled to the risks and rewards associated with those assets, and instead recognises the lending as loans and advances to banks or customers, as appropriate.
Reverse repos are set out in the table below.

As a result, the Group continues to recognise the assets on its balance sheet, together with the associated liability instruments issued by the SEs.
The holders of the liability instruments have recourse only to the assets transferred to the SEs.
The following table sets out the carrying value and fair value of the assets transferred and the carrying value and fair value of the associated liabilities.
