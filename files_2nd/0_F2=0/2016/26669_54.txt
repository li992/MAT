Impairment testing of acquired brands The carrying values of acquired brands are subject to annual impairment reviews on a value in use basis.
The recoverable amount of each brand is calculated based on anticipated future income generated by that brand.
The key assumptions used in the impairment testing of brands are a pre-tax discount rate of 5.5% 2015: 6.0% and a long-term growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the cash flow projection period of one year of 2.0% 2015: 2.0% in line with an expected long-term growth rate which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry.
These assumptions are based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects, and take account of economic forecasts, marketing plans, political factors and assessments of competitors strategy.
The above impairment tests demonstrated that the Group had sufficient levels of headroom and as such no impairment of acquired brands was required in the current or prior period.
