a Since 2010, vesting of the deferred shares has been subject to a safety and environmental sustainability hurdle, and this will continue.
If the committee assesses that there has been a material deterioration in safety and environmental performance, or there have been major incidents, either of which reveal underlying weaknesses in safety and environmental management, then it may conclude that shares should vest only in part, or not at all.
In reaching its conclusion, the committee will obtain advice from the SEEAC.
There is no identified minimum vesting threshold level.
b Bob Dudley and Dr Byron Grote received awards in the form of ADSs.
The above numbers reflect calculated equivalents in ordinary shares.
One ADS is equivalent to six ordinary shares.
c Represents vestings of shares made at the end of the relevant performance period based on performance achieved under rules of the plan and includes reinvested dividends on the shares vested.
The market price of each share used to determine the total value at vesting on the vesting dates of 9 February 2016 and 24 February 2017 were 3.34 and 4.47 respectively and for ADSs on 9 February 2016 and 24 February 2017 were $28.95 and $33.50 respectively.
d The face value has been calculated using the market price of ordinary shares on 11 February 2015 of 4.46. e The market price at closing of ordinary shares on 4 March 2016 was 3.68 and for ADSs was $31.15.
The sterling value has been used to calculate the face value.
f All matching shares have been pro-rated to reflect actual service during the performance period and these figures have been used to calculate the face value.
g Bob Dudley has voluntarily agreed to defer vesting of these awards until after retirement.
Therefore the performance period is expected to exceed the minimum term of three years.
Each performance period ends on 31 December of the third year.
There is no identified overall minimum vesting threshold level but to comply with UK regulations a value of 44.4%, which is conditional on the TSR, operating cash flow and each of the strategic imperatives reaching the minimum threshold, has been calculated.
The market price of each share at the vesting date of 28 April 2016 was 3.82 and for ADSs was $33.49.
For the assumed vestings dated May 2017 a price of 4.73 per ordinary share and $35.39 per ADS has been used.
These are the average prices from the fourth quarter of 2016. d The 2013-2015 award vested on 28 April 2016, which resulted in an increase in value at vesting of 4,405 for Iain Conn and a decrease of $23,233 for Byron Grote.

The operation of variable pay is supported by a focus on stewardship.
There is an expectation that executives will build up a holding of five times salary over a period of five years following appointment and maintain that level during employment.
How are performance measures linked to the strategy under the new policy?
Variable pay is linked to performance measures designed to deliver the BP strategy.
At the start of each year, the remuneration committee reviews the measures, targets and weightings to ensure they remain consistent with the priorities in the annual plan and the group strategy.

BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 111 Longer-term viability In accordance with provision C. 2.2 of the Code, the directors have assessed the prospects of the company over a period significantly longer than 12 months.
The directors believe that an assessment period of three years is appropriate based on managements reasonable expectations of the position and performance of the company over this period, taking account of its short-term and longer-range plans.
Taking into account the companys current position and its principal risks, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over three years.
The directors assessment included a review of the financial impact of the most severe but plausible scenarios that could threaten the viability of the company and the likely effectiveness of the potential mitigations that management reasonably believes would be available to the company over this period.
In assessing the prospects of the company, the directors noted that such assessment is subject to a degree of uncertainty that can be expected to increase looking out over time and, accordingly, that future outcomes cannot be guaranteed or predicted with certainty.
Going concern In accordance with provision C. 1.3 of the Code, the directors have made an assessment of the groups ability to continue as a going concern and consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Fair, balanced and understandable The board considers the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the companys position and performance, business model and strategy.

Our assessment of the risks of material misstatement We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team.
In addressing these risks, we designed and performed the procedures below for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the financial statements as a whole.
We do not express any opinion on these individual risks.
Other than as described, these matters are unchanged from those we reported in our 2015 audit opinion.

purchases, trade receivables and trade payables.
Changes from the prior year Our risk assessment and audit approach evolve as circumstances which impact the groups business or financial statements change.
Since the 2015 audit we have changed our assessment of the risk of material misstatement as this relates to the groups investment in Rosneft.
The continued demonstration of significant influence by the group over Rosneft, along with the relative stabilization of the current environment in Russia, meant that in our view the profile of this risk had reduced and no longer had a significant effect on our audit strategy or our allocation of resources.
The scope of our audit Tailoring the scope Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each entity within the group.
Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
We take into account size, risk profile, the organization of the group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each component.
In scoping the audit we reflect the groups structure Upstream, Downstream, Rosneft and Other businesses and corporate, plus the groups functions.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, we performed full or specific scope audit procedures over 50 components covering the UK, US, Angola, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Germany, India, Iraq, Russia, Singapore, Trinidad and the group functions, representing the principal business units within the group.
Of the 50 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of 9 components full scope components which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics.
For the remaining 41 components specific scope components, we This page does not form part of BPs Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.
116 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 Financial statements performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.
For the current year, the full scope components contributed 29% of the groups loss before tax 2015 43%, 41% of the groups revenue 2015 41% and 10% of the groups property, plant and equipment 2015 11%.
The specific scope components contributed 32% of the groups loss before tax 2015 10%, 26% of the groups revenue 2015 29% and 54% of the groups property, plant and equipment 2015 55%.
The audit scope of the specific scope components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the group.
Of the 41 specific scope components, we instructed 10 of these locations to perform specified procedures over impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, recoverability of certain receivables and the carrying value of certain investments held by the group.
The remaining components not subject to full or specific group scoping are not significant individually or in the aggregate.
They include many small, low risk components and balances: each remaining component represents an average of 0.11% of the total group loss before tax and 0.11% of total group revenue.
For these components, we performed other procedures, including evaluating and testing managements group wide controls across a range of geographies and segments, specifically testing the oversight and review controls that management has in place to ensure there are no material misstatements in these locations.
We performed analytical and enquiry procedures to address the risk of residual misstatement on a segment-wide and component basis.
We tested consolidation journals to identify the existence of any further risks of misstatement that could have been material to the group financial statements.
Involvement with component teams In establishing our overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction.
Of the 9 full scope components, audit procedures were performed on 5 of these directly by the primary audit engagement team.
For the 41 specific scope components, audit procedures were performed on 25 of these directly by the primary audit engagement team.
Testing of managements group wide controls was performed by component auditors.
Where work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the group as a whole.
The group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor or his designate visits significant locations to ensure the audit is executed and delivered in accordance with the planned approach and to confirm the quality of the audit work undertaken.
During the current years audit cycle, visits were undertaken by the primary audit engagement team to the component teams in Germany, India, Russia, Singapore, Trinidad and the US.
Part of the purpose of these visits is to confirm that appropriate procedures have been performed by the auditors of the components and that the significant audit areas were covered as communicated in the detailed audit instructions, including the risks of material misstatement as outlined above.
The primary audit engagement team review included examining key working papers and conclusions where these related to areas of management and auditor judgement with specific focus on the risks detailed above.
The primary audit engagement team also participated in the component teams planning, during visits made earlier in the audit period.
Telephone and video meetings were held with the auditors at locations which the primary audit engagement team did not visit in person.
This, together with additional procedures performed at group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the group financial statements.
One of the significant locations is Russia, which includes Rosneft, a material associate not controlled by BP.
We were provided with appropriate access to Rosnefts auditor in order to ensure they had completed the procedures required by ISA 600 on the financial statements of Rosneft, used as the basis for BPs equity accounting.
Our application of materiality We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.
Materiality The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements.
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the group to be $0.5 billion 2015 $0.5 billion.
For our current year audit we changed the basis of determining materiality from current year underlying replacement cost profit before interest and taxation as defined on page 284 that was used in 2015.
In setting audit materiality for the current year we considered the activity levels within the business and the fact that the commodity prices experienced in the current period are below those expected in the coming years by the group and the wider market.
We believe it is appropriate in these circumstances to determine materiality based on 5% of the average 2016 underlying replacement cost profit before interest and taxation and how those results would look if the oil and gas prices forecast by the company for 2017 and 2018 had prevailed in the year.
These forward earnings have been determined using BPs Rules of Thumb, available on the website, applied to the 2016 actual results as the base year.
Underlying replacement cost profit before interest and taxation remains the most appropriate measure upon which to calculate materiality, due to the fact it excludes the impact of changes in crude oil, gas and product prices and items disclosed as non-operating items, which can significantly distort the groups results in a given period.
For details of non-operating items please see page 241 of the Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016.
During the course of our audit, we re-assessed initial materiality in the context of the groups performance and forward expectations and this resulted in no change from our original assessment of materiality.
Performance materiality The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level.
It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the groups overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% 2015 75% of our materiality, namely $375 million 2015 $375 million.
We have set performance materiality at this percentage to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 117 Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality.
The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.
In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was $75 million to $281 million 2015 $75 million to $300 million.
Reporting threshold An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of $25 million 2015 $25 million, which is set at 5% of materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the groups and the parent companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the group financial position of BP p. l. c. at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 and the group results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2016, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, BP p. l. c. s internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2016, based on criteria established in the UK Financial Reporting Councils Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting and our report dated 6 April 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion.

120 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 Financial statements Consolidated financial statements of the BP group Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The board of directors and shareholders of BP p. l. c. We have audited BP p. l. c. s internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2016, based on criteria established in the UK Financial Reporting Councils Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting.
BP p. l. c. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements report on internal control over financial reporting on page 267.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company: 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company: and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, BP p. l. c. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2016, based on the UK Financial Reporting Councils Guidance.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the group balance sheets of BP p. l. c. as of 31 December 2016 and 2015, and the related group income statement, group statement of comprehensive income, group statement of changes in equity and group cash flow statement for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2016, and our report dated 6 April 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions Authorization of financial statements and statement of compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards The consolidated financial statements of the BP group for the year ended 31 December 2016 were approved and signed by the group chief executive and chairman on 6 April 2017 having been duly authorized to do so by the board of directors.
BP p. l. c. is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006.
IFRS as adopted by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB.
The differences have no impact on the groups consolidated financial statements for the years presented.
The significant accounting policies and accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions of the group are set out below.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with IFRS and IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations issued and effective for the year ended 31 December 2016.
The accounting policies that follow have been consistently applied to all years presented.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million dollars $ million, except where otherwise indicated.
Significant accounting policies: use of judgements, estimates and assumptions Inherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements is the need for BP management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.
The accounting judgements and estimates that could have a significant impact on the results of the group are set out in boxed text below, and should be read in conjunction with the information provided in the Notes on financial statements.
The areas requiring the most significant judgement and estimation in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are: accounting for interests in other entities: oil and natural gas accounting, including the estimation of reserves: the recoverability of asset carrying values, including trade receivables: derivative financial instruments, including the application of hedge accounting: provisions and contingencies, including provisions and contingencies related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill: pensions and other post-retirement benefits: and income taxes.
Basis of consolidation The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of BP p. l. c. and its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that control ceases.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
Intra-group balances and transactions, including unrealized profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated.
Unrealized losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Non-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to BP shareholders.
Interests in other entities Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount recognized for any non-controlling interest and the acquisition-date fair values of any previously held interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
At the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, expected to benefit from the combinations synergies.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill arising on business combinations prior to 1 January 2003 is stated at the previous carrying amount under UK generally accepted accounting practice, less subsequent impairments.
See Note 13 for further information.
Goodwill may also arise upon investments in joint ventures and associates, being the surplus of the cost of investment over the groups share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities.
Any such goodwill is recorded within the corresponding investment in joint ventures and associates.
Interests in joint arrangements The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting as described below.
Certain of the groups activities, particularly in the Upstream segment, are conducted through joint operations.
BP recognizes, on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated financial statements, its share of the assets, liabilities and expenses of these joint operations incurred jointly with the other partners, along with the groups income from the sale of its share of the output and any liabilities and expenses that the group has incurred in relation to the joint operation.
Interests in associates The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting as described below.
Significant judgement: accounting for interests in other entities Judgement is required in assessing the level of control obtained in a transaction to acquire an interest in another entity: depending upon the facts and circumstances in each case, BP may obtain control, joint control or significant influence over the entity or arrangement.
Transactions which give BP control of a business are business combinations.
If BP obtains joint control of an arrangement, judgement is also required to assess whether the arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture.
If BP has neither control nor joint control, it may be in a position to exercise significant influence over the entity, which is then classified as an associate.
Since 21 March 2013, BP has owned 19.75% of the voting shares of Rosneft Oil Company Rosneft, a Russian oil and gas company.
The Russian federal government, through its investment company JSC Rosneftegaz, owned 50% plus one share of the voting shares of Rosneft at 31 December 2016.
BP uses the equity method of accounting for its investment in Rosneft because under IFRS it is considered to have significant influence.
Significant influence is defined as the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee 126 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 Financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions continued but is not control or joint control.
IFRS identifies several indicators that may provide evidence of significant influence, including representation on the board of directors of the investee and participation in policy-making processes.
BPs group chief executive, Bob Dudley, has been a member of the board of directors of Rosneft since 2013 and he is a member of the Rosneft boards Strategic Planning Committee.
A second BP-nominated director, Guillermo Quintero, has been a member of the Rosneft board and its HR and Remuneration Committee since 2015.
BP also holds the voting rights at general meetings of shareholders conferred by its 19.75% stake in Rosneft.
In managements judgement, the group has significant influence over Rosneft, as defined by the relevant accounting standard, and the investment is, therefore, classified as an associate and accounted for using the equity method.
BPs share of Rosnefts oil and natural gas reserves is included in the estimated net proved reserves of equity-accounted entities.
The equity method of accounting Under the equity method, the investment is carried on the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the groups share of net assets of the entity, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of the investment.
Loans advanced to equity-accounted entities that have the characteristics of equity financing are also included in the investment on the group balance sheet.
The group income statement reflects the groups share of the results after tax of the equity-accounted entity, adjusted to account for depreciation, amortization and any impairment of the equity-accounted entitys assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The group statement of comprehensive income includes the groups share of the equity-accounted entitys other comprehensive income.
The groups share of amounts recognized directly in equity by an equity-accounted entity is recognized directly in the groups statement of changes in equity.
Financial statements of equity-accounted entities are prepared for the same reporting year as the group.
Where material differences arise, adjustments are made to those financial statements to bring the accounting policies used into line with those of the group.
Unrealized gains on transactions between the group and its equity-accounted entities are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the equity-accounted entity.
The group assesses investments in equity-accounted entities for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is compared with its recoverable amount, being the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment is written down to its recoverable amount.
Segmental reporting The groups operating segments are established on the basis of those components of the group that are evaluated regularly by the group chief executive, BPs chief operating decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the groups accounting policies described in this note, except that IFRS requires that the measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker.
For BP, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit before interest and tax which reflects the replacement cost of inventories sold in the period and is arrived at by excluding inventory holding gains and losses from profit.
Replacement cost profit for the group is not a recognized measure under IFRS.
For further information see Note 5.
Foreign currency translation In individual subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of those entities at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
Any resulting exchange differences are included in the income statement, unless hedge accounting is applied.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities, other than those measured at fair value, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition.
In the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates, and related goodwill, are translated into US dollars at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
The results and cash flows of non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into US dollars using average rates of exchange.
In the consolidated financial statements, exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into US dollars are recognized in a separate component of equity and reported in other comprehensive income.
Exchange gains and losses arising on long-term intra-group foreign currency borrowings used to finance the groups non-US dollar investments are also reported in other comprehensive income.
On disposal or partial disposal of a non-US dollar functional currency subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the related accumulated exchange gains and losses recognized in equity are reclassified from equity to the income statement.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets.
Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, and actions required to complete the plan of sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortized once classified as held for sale.
Intangible assets Intangible assets, other than goodwill, include expenditure on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources, computer software, patents, licences and trademarks and are stated at the amount initially recognized, less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition and is recognized separately from goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights.
BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 127 1.
Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions continued Intangible assets with a finite life, other than capitalized exploration and appraisal costs as described below, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.
For patents, licences and trademarks, expected useful life is the shorter of the duration of the legal agreement and economic useful life, and can range from three to 15 years.
Computer software costs generally have a useful life of three to five years.
The expected useful lives of assets are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives are accounted for prospectively.
Oil and natural gas exploration, appraisal and development expenditure Oil and natural gas exploration, appraisal and development expenditure is accounted for using the principles of the successful efforts method of accounting as described below.
Licence and property acquisition costs Exploration licence and leasehold property acquisition costs are capitalized within intangible assets and are reviewed at each reporting date to confirm that there is no indication that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
This review includes confirming that exploration drilling is still under way or planned or that it has been determined, or work is under way to determine, that the discovery is economically viable based on a range of technical and commercial considerations, and sufficient progress is being made on establishing development plans and timing.
If no future activity is planned, the remaining balance of the licence and property acquisition costs is written off.
Lower value licences are pooled and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of exploration.
Upon recognition of proved reserves and internal approval for development, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property, plant and equipment.
Exploration and appraisal expenditure Geological and geophysical exploration costs are recognized as an expense as incurred.
Costs directly associated with an exploration well are initially capitalized as an intangible asset until the drilling of the well is complete and the results have been evaluated.
These costs include employee remuneration, materials and fuel used, rig costs and payments made to contractors.
If potentially commercial quantities of hydrocarbons are not found, the exploration well costs are written off.
If hydrocarbons are found and, subject to further appraisal activity, are likely to be capable of commercial development, the costs continue to be carried as an asset.
If it is determined that development will not occur then the costs are expensed.
Costs directly associated with appraisal activity undertaken to determine the size, characteristics and commercial potential of a reservoir following the initial discovery of hydrocarbons, including the costs of appraisal wells where hydrocarbons were not found, are initially capitalized as an intangible asset.
When proved reserves of oil and natural gas are determined and development is approved by management, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property, plant and equipment.
Development expenditure Expenditure on the construction, installation and completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of development wells, including service and unsuccessful development or delineation wells, is capitalized within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated from the commencement of production as described below in the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment.
Significant judgement: oil and natural gas accounting The determination of whether potentially economic oil and natural gas reserves have been discovered by an exploration well is usually made within one year of well completion, but can take longer, depending on the complexity of the geological structure.
Exploration wells that discover potentially economic quantities of oil and natural gas and are in areas where major capital expenditure e. g. an offshore platform or a pipeline would be required before production could begin, and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends on the successful completion of further exploration work in the area, remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as additional exploration or appraisal work is under way or firmly planned.
It is not unusual to have exploration wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells remaining suspended on the balance sheet for several years while additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and natural gas field is performed or while the optimum development plans and timing are established.
All such carried costs are subject to regular technical, commercial and management review on at least an annual basis to confirm the continued intent to develop, or otherwise extract value from, the discovery.
Where this is no longer the case, the costs are immediately expensed.
One of the facts and circumstances which indicate that an entity should test such assets for impairment is that the period for which the entity has a right to explore in the specific area has expired or will expire in the near future, and is not expected to be renewed.
BP has leases in the Gulf of Mexico making up a prospect, some with terms which were scheduled to expire at the end of 2013 and some with terms which were scheduled to expire at the end of 2014.
A significant proportion of our capitalized exploration and appraisal costs in the Gulf of Mexico relate to this prospect.
This prospect requires the development of subsea technology to ensure that the hydrocarbons can be extracted safely.
BP is in negotiation with the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement in relation to seeking extension of these leases so that the discovered hydrocarbons can be developed.
BP remains committed to developing this prospect and expects that the leases will be renewed and, therefore, continues to carry the capitalized costs on its balance sheet.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the initial estimate of any decommissioning obligation, if any, and, for assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, finance costs.
The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
The capitalized value of a finance lease is also included within property, plant and equipment.
Expenditure on major maintenance refits or repairs comprises the cost of replacement assets or parts of assets, inspection costs and overhaul costs.
Where an asset or part of an asset that was separately depreciated is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group, the expenditure is capitalized and the carrying amount of the replaced asset is derecognized.
Inspection costs associated with major maintenance programmes are capitalized and amortized over the period to the next inspection.
Overhaul costs for major maintenance programmes, and all other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Oil and natural gas properties, including related pipelines, are depreciated using a unit-of-production method.
The cost of producing wells is amortized over proved developed reserves.
Licence acquisition, common facilities and future decommissioning costs are amortized over total proved reserves.
The unit-of-production rate for the depreciation of common facilities takes into account expenditures incurred to date, together 128 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 Financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions continued with estimated future capital expenditure expected to be incurred relating to as yet undeveloped reserves expected to be processed through these common facilities.
Other property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life.
The typical useful lives of the groups other property, plant and equipment are as follows: Land improvements 15 to 25 years Buildings 20 to 50 years Refineries 20 to 30 years Petrochemicals plants 20 to 30 years Pipelines 10 to 50 years Service stations 15 years Office equipment 3 to 7 years Fixtures and fittings 5 to 15 years The expected useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives are accounted for prospectively.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item is included in the income statement in the period in which the item is derecognized.
Significant judgements and estimates: estimation of oil and natural gas reserves Significant technical and commercial judgements are required to determine the groups estimated oil and natural gas reserves.
Reserves estimates are regularly reviewed and updated.
Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact on the determination of the groups estimates of its oil and natural gas reserves.
BP bases its proved reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.
The estimation of oil and natural gas reserves and BPs process to manage reserves bookings is described in Supplementary information on oil and natural gas on page 187, which is unaudited.
Details on BPs proved reserves and production compliance and governance processes are provided on page 252.
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves determined by applying US Securities and Exchange Commission regulations are used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization charges for the groups oil and gas properties.
The impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortizing the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected future production.
Oil and natural gas reserves estimates also have a direct impact on the assessment of the recoverability of asset carrying values reported in the financial statements.
If proved reserves estimates determined by applying managements assumptions are revised downwards, earnings could be affected by changes in depreciation expense or an immediate write-down of the propertys carrying value.
The 2016 movements in proved reserves are reflected in the tables showing movements in oil and natural gas reserves by region in Supplementary information on oil and natural gas unaudited on page 187.
Information on the carrying amounts of the groups oil and natural gas properties, together with the amounts recognized in the income statement as depreciation, depletion and amortization is contained in Note 11 and Note 5 respectively.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and goodwill The group assesses assets or groups of assets, called cash-generating units CGUs, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or CGU may not be recoverable: for example, changes in the groups business plans, changes in the groups assumptions about commodity prices, low plant utilization, evidence of physical damage or, for oil and gas assets, significant downward revisions of estimated reserves or increases in estimated future development expenditure or decommissioning costs.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the group makes an estimate of the assets or CGUs recoverable amount.
Individual assets are grouped into CGUs for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.
A CGUs recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
Where the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the CGU is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
The business segment plans, which are approved on an annual basis by senior management, are the primary source of information for the determination of value in use.
They contain forecasts for oil and natural gas production, refinery throughputs, sales volumes for various types of refined products e. g. gasoline and lubricants, revenues, costs and capital expenditure.
As an initial step in the preparation of these plans, various assumptions regarding market conditions, such as oil prices, natural gas prices, refining margins, refined product margins and cost inflation rates are set by senior management.
These assumptions take account of existing prices, global supply-demand equilibrium for oil and natural gas, other macroeconomic factors and historical trends and variability.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are adjusted for the risks specific to the asset group and are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
Fair value less costs of disposal is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants and does not reflect the effects of factors that may be specific to the group and not applicable to entities in general.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized.
If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the lower of its recoverable amount and the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.
Impairment reversals are recognized in profit or loss.
After a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs to which the goodwill relates should be assessed.
In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is compared with its recoverable amount.
Where the recoverable amount of the group of BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 129 1.
Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions continued CGUs is less than the carrying amount including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized.
An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values Determination as to whether, and by how much, an asset, CGU, or group of CGUs containing goodwill is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as the effects of inflation and deflation on operating expenses, discount rates, production profiles, reserves and resources, and future commodity prices, including the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas and refined products.
Judgement is required when determining the appropriate grouping of assets into a CGU or the appropriate grouping of CGUs for impairment testing purposes.
See Note 13 for details on how these groupings have been determined in relation to the impairment testing of goodwill.
As disclosed above, the recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal.
Fair value less costs of disposal may be determined based on similar recent market transaction data or, where recent market transactions for the asset are not available for reference, using discounted cash flow techniques.
Where discounted cash flow analyses are used to calculate fair value less costs of disposal, accounting judgements are made about the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset, CGU or group of CGUs containing goodwill and the test is performed on a post-tax basis.
Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, BP is required to test annually for impairment of goodwill acquired in business combinations.
The group carries goodwill of approximately $11.2 billion on its balance sheet 2015 $11.6 billion, principally relating to the Atlantic Richfield, Burmah Castrol, Devon Energy and Reliance transactions.
In testing goodwill for impairment, the group uses the approach described above to determine recoverable amount.
If there are low oil or natural gas prices for an extended period, the group may need to recognize goodwill impairment charges.
Details of impairment charges and reversals recognized in the income statement are provided in Note 4 and details on the carrying amounts of assets are shown in Note 11, Note 13 and Note 14.
Specific judgements and estimates made in impairment tests in 2016 relating to discount rates, oil and gas properties and oil and gas prices are discussed below.
Discountrates For value-in-use calculations, future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the cash-generating unit and are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate.
The pre-tax discount rate is based upon the cost of funding the group derived from an established model, adjusted to a pre-tax basis.
Fair value less costs of disposal calculations use the post-tax discount rate.
The discount rates applied in impairment tests are reassessed each year.
In 2016 the discount rate used to determine recoverable amounts based on fair value less costs of disposal was revised to 6% 2015 7%.
The discount rate used to determine recoverable amounts based on value in use was revised to 9% 2015 11%.
In both cases, where the cash-generating unit is located in a country which is judged to be higher risk an additional 2% premium was added to the discount rate 2015 2%.
Oil andnatural gasproperties For oil and natural gas properties, expected future cash flows are estimated using managements best estimate of future oil and natural gas prices and production and reserves volumes.
The estimated future level of production in all impairment tests is based on assumptions about future commodity prices, production and development costs, field decline rates, current fiscal regimes and other factors.
Reserves assumptions for value-in-use tests are restricted to proved and probable reserves.
When estimating the fair value of our Upstream assets, assumptions reflect all reserves and resources that a market participant would consider when valuing the asset, which in some cases are broader in scope than the reserves used in a value-in-use test.
In determining a fair value, risk factors may be applied to reserves and resources which do not meet the criteria to be treated as proved.
Depending upon the classification of the reserves and resources, this can result in associated forecast cash flows being reduced by a factor of between 10% and 90% from their estimated full potential value.
Changing the risk factor applied will in some cases have an impact upon the carrying value of the asset concerned.
A 10% increase in the risk factors used in any single test could have an impact of up to $0.4 billion upon the carrying value of that asset.
The recoverability of intangible exploration and appraisal expenditure is covered under Oil and natural gas exploration, appraisal and development expenditure above.
Oil andgasprices During the third quarter of 2016, the price assumptions used in impairment tests were revised.
The long-term price assumptions used to determine recoverable amount based on fair value less costs of disposal from 2022 onwards are derived from $75 per barrel for Brent and $4 mmBtu for Henry Hub both in 2015 prices inflated for the remaining life of the asset.
For 2015 the equivalent values were $80 per barrel for Brent and $5 mmBtu for Henry Hub.
To determine recoverable amount based on value in use, the price assumptions were inflated to 2022 but from 2022 onwards were not inflated.
For both value-in-use and fair value less costs of disposal impairment tests, the price assumptions used for the five-year period to 2021 have been set such that there is a gradual transition from current market prices to the long-term price assumptions as noted above.
For 2015, market prices were used for the first five years ranging from $40 per barrel for Brent and $2.38 mmBtu for Henry Hub in 2016 to $56 per barrel for Brent and $3.18 mmBtu in 2020.
Prices used this year were revised due to a lack of liquidity in the market beyond the very near term.
Current market prices for oil reflect the elevated level of oil stocks following strong growth in US shale and OPEC production volumes in recent years.
US production fell during 2016 in response to lower prices and, towards the end of the year, OPEC and a number of non-OPEC countries announced an agreement to reduce production volumes.
BPs long-term assumption for oil is higher than current market prices because prices are expected to increase as the current record level of oil inventories is gradually unwound, underpinned by solid demand growth and muted increases in supply.
US gas prices have fallen back recently in response to the unusually mild winter.
BPs long-term price assumption for US gas is higher than current market prices because we expect demand for US gas to grow with increased exports of liquefied natural gas LNG, underpinned by strong growth in the global demand for gas.
We expect natural gas to be the fastest growing fossil fuel over the next 20 years, supported by increasing environmental regulation encouraging a switch from coal to cleaner, lower carbon fuels including gas, as well as renewables.
130 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 Financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions continued Inventories Inventories, other than inventories held for short-term trading purposes, are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
Cost is determined by the first-in first-out method and comprises direct purchase costs, cost of production, transportation and manufacturing expenses.
Net realizable value is determined by reference to prices existing at the balance sheet date, adjusted where the sale of inventories after the reporting period gives evidence about their net realizable value at the end of the period.
Inventories held for short-term trading purposes are stated at fair value less costs to sell and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement.
Supplies are valued at the lower of cost on a weighted average basis and net realizable value.
Leases Agreements under which payments are made to owners in return for the right to use an asset are accounted for as leases.
Leases that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are recognized as finance leases.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases.
Finance leases are capitalized at the commencement of the lease term at the fair value of the leased item or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Finance charges are allocated to each period so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability and are charged directly against income.
Capitalized leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Financial assets Financial assets are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as follows: Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognized in income when the loans and receivables are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortization process.
This category of financial assets includes trade and other receivables.
Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and generally have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income statement.
Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging instruments, are classified as held for trading and are included in this category.
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge These derivatives are carried on the balance sheet at fair value.
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluation is described below in the accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.
Held-to-maturity financial assets Held-to-maturity financial assets are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value, with gains or losses recognized within other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses, and, for available-for-sale debt instruments, foreign exchange gains or losses, interest recognized using the effective interest method, and any changes in fair value arising from revised estimates of future cash flows, which are recognized in profit or loss.
Impairment of loans and receivables The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced, with the amount of the loss recognized in the income statement.
Significant judgement: recoverability of trade receivables Judgements are required in assessing the recoverability of overdue trade receivables and determining whether a provision against those receivables is required.
Factors considered include the credit rating of the counterparty, the amount and timing of anticipated future payments and any possible actions that can be taken to mitigate the risk of non-payment.
See Note 28 for information on overdue receivables.
Financial liabilities The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as follows: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income statement.
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost All other financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs.
For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this is the fair value of the proceeds received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.
This category of financial liabilities includes trade and other payables and finance debt, except finance debt designated in a fair value hedge relationship.
BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 131 1.
Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions continued Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The group uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, as well as for trading purposes.
These derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Contracts to buy or sell a non-financial item for example, oil, oil products, gas or power that can be settled net in cash, with the exception of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the groups expected purchase, sale or usage requirements, are accounted for as financial instruments.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as effective hedging instruments are recognized in the income statement.
Contracts to buy or sell LNG are not accounted for as derivatives as they are not considered capable of being settled net in cash.
If, at inception of a contract, the valuation cannot be supported by observable market data, any gain or loss determined by the valuation methodology is not recognized in the income statement but is deferred on the balance sheet and is commonly known as day-one gain or loss.
This deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement over the life of the contract until substantially all the remaining contract term can be valued using observable market data at which point any remaining deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement.
Changes in valuation subsequent to the initial valuation are recognized immediately in the income statement.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as: fair value hedges when hedging exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to either a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Hedge relationships are formally designated and documented at inception, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged items fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows.
Hedges meeting the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: Fair value hedges The change in fair value of a hedging derivative is recognized in profit or loss.
The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognized in profit or loss.
The group applies fair value hedge accounting when hedging interest rate risk and certain currency risks on fixed rate borrowings.
If the criteria for hedge accounting are no longer met, or if the group revokes the designation, the accumulated adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item at such time is then amortized to profit or loss over the remaining period to maturity.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedging instrument is reported in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognized in profit or loss.
Amounts reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
Where the hedged item is a non-financial asset or liability, such as a forecast foreign currency transaction for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, the amounts recognized within other comprehensive income are reclassified to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
Where the hedged item is an equity investment, the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income remain in the separate component of equity until the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss.
Where the hedged item is recognized directly in profit or loss, the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to production and manufacturing expenses, except for cash flow hedges of variable interest rate risk which are reclassified to finance costs.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognized within other comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are reclassified to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above.
Significant judgement: application of hedge accounting The decision as to whether to apply hedge accounting within subsidiaries, and by equity-accounted entities, can have a significant impact on the groups financial statements.
Cash flow and fair value hedge accounting is applied to certain finance debt-related instruments in the normal course of business and cash flow hedge accounting is applied to certain highly probable foreign currency transactions as part of the management of currency risk.
See Note 28 and Note 29 for further information.
Fair value measurement Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
The group categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three levels depending on the ability to observe inputs employed in their measurement.
Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs are inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, other than quoted prices included within level 1 for the asset or liability.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or BPs assumptions about pricing by market participants.
Significant estimate: valuation of derivatives In some cases the fair values of derivatives are estimated using internal models due to the absence of quoted prices or other observable, market-corroborated data.
This applies to the groups longer-term derivative contracts.
The majority of these contracts are valued using models with inputs that include price curves for each of the different products that are built up from available active market pricing data and modelled using the maximum available external pricing information.
Additionally, where limited data exists for certain products, prices are determined using historic and long-term pricing relationships.
Price volatility is also an input for options models.
Changes in the key assumptions could have a material impact on the fair value gains and losses on derivatives recognized in the income statement.
For more information see Note 29.
132 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 Financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions continued Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are presented gross in the balance sheet unless both of the following criteria are met: the group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts: and the group intends to either settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
A right of set off is the groups legal right to settle an amount payable to a creditor by applying against it an amount receivable from the same counterparty.
The relevant legal jurisdiction and laws applicable to the relationships between the parties are considered when assessing whether a current legally enforceable right to set off exists.
Provisions and contingencies Provisions are recognized when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where appropriate, the future cash flow estimates are adjusted to reflect risks specific to the liability.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax riskfree rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized within finance costs.
A provision is discounted using either a nominal discount rate of 2% 2015 2.75% or a real discount rate of 0.5% 2015 0.75%, as appropriate.
Provisions are split between amounts expected to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date current and amounts expected to be settled later non-current.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will only be confirmed by future events not wholly within the control of the group, or present obligations where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote.
Decommissioning Liabilities for decommissioning costs are recognized when the group has an obligation to plug and abandon a well, dismantle and remove a facility or an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reliable estimate of that liability can be made.
Where an obligation exists for a new facility or item of plant, such as oil and natural gas production or transportation facilities, this liability will be recognized on construction or installation.
Similarly, where an obligation exists for a well, this liability is recognized when it is drilled.
An obligation for decommissioning may also crystallize during the period of operation of a well, facility or item of plant through a change in legislation or through a decision to terminate operations: an obligation may also arise in cases where an asset has been sold but the subsequent owner is no longer able to fulfil its decommissioning obligations, for example due to bankruptcy.
The amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements.
The provision for the costs of decommissioning wells, production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives is estimated using existing technology, at current prices or future assumptions, depending on the expected timing of the activity, and discounted using the real discount rate.
The weighted average period over which these costs are generally expected to be incurred is estimated to be approximately 18 years.
An amount equivalent to the decommissioning provision is recognized as part of the corresponding intangible asset in the case of an exploration or appraisal well or property, plant and equipment.
The decommissioning portion of the property, plant and equipment is subsequently depreciated at the same rate as the rest of the asset.
Other than the unwinding of discount on the provision, any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the corresponding asset.
Environmental expenditures and liabilities Environmental expenditures that are required in order for the group to obtain future economic benefits from its assets are capitalized as part of those assets.
Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future earnings are expensed.
Liabilities for environmental costs are recognized when a clean-up is probable and the associated costs can be reliably estimated.
Generally, the timing of recognition of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.
The amount recognized is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation.
Provisions for environmental liabilities have been estimated using existing technology, at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate.
The weighted average period over which these costs are generally expected to be incurred is estimated to be approximately five years.
Significant judgements and estimates: provisions During 2016, significant progress was made in resolving outstanding claims arising from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon accident and oil spill for which, at 31 December 2015, no reliable estimate could be made.
As a result, a judgement has been made that a reliable estimate can now be made for all remaining material liabilities arising from the incident.
Consequently, the groups provision at 31 December 2016 for costs associated with the incident now includes the estimated cost of resolving all outstanding business economic loss claims under the Plaintiffs Steering Committee PSC settlement and the cost of resolving economic loss and property damage claims from individuals and businesses that opted out of the PSC settlement and or were excluded from that settlement.
The provision for outstanding business economic loss claims under the PSC settlement was determined based upon an expected value of the remaining claims and the resultant charge was recognized in the income statement.
Claims are determined by the Deepwater Horizon Court Supervised Settlement Program in accordance with the PSC settlement agreement and, in addition, certain claims are settled by BP.
The amounts ultimately payable may differ from the amount provided and the timing of payment is uncertain.
A significant number of claims determined by the DHCSSP have been and may be appealed by BP and or the claimants.
Depending upon the resolution of these claims, the amount payable may differ from what is currently provided for.
Any further outstanding Deepwater Horizon related claims are not expected to have a material impact on the groups financial performance.
The group holds provisions for the future decommissioning of oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives.
The largest decommissioning obligations facing BP relate to the plugging and abandonment of wells and the removal and disposal of oil and natural gas platforms and pipelines around the world.
Most of these decommissioning events are many years in the future and the precise requirements that will have to be met when the removal event occurs are uncertain.
Decommissioning technologies and costs are constantly changing, as well as political, environmental, safety and public expectations.
BP believes that the impact of any reasonably foreseeable change to these provisions on the groups results of operations, financial position or liquidity will not be material.
If oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines are sold to third parties and the subsequent owner is unable to meet their decommissioning obligations, judgement must be used to determine whether BP is then responsible for decommissioning, and if so the extent of that responsibility.
The timing and amounts of future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainty.
Any changes in the expected future costs are reflected in both the provision and the asset.
BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 133 1.
Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions continued Decommissioning provisions associated with downstream and petrochemicals facilities are generally not recognized, as the potential obligations cannot be measured, given their indeterminate settlement dates.
The group performs periodic reviews of its downstream and petrochemicals long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require the recognition of a decommissioning provision.
The provision for environmental liabilities is estimated based on current legal and constructive requirements, technology, price levels and expected plans for remediation.
Actual costs and cash outflows can differ from estimates because of changes in laws and regulations, public expectations, prices, discovery and analysis of site conditions and changes in clean-up technology.
Other provisions and liabilities are recognized in the period when it becomes probable that there will be a future outflow of funds resulting from past operations or events and the amount of cash outflow can be reliably estimated.
The timing of recognition and quantification of the liability require the application of judgement to existing facts and circumstances, which can be subject to change.
Since the cash outflows can take place many years in the future, the carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities are reviewed regularly and adjusted to take account of changing facts and circumstances.
The timing and amount of future expenditures are reviewed annually, together with the interest rate used in discounting the cash flows.
The interest rate used to determine the balance sheet obligation at the end of 2016 was a real rate of 0.5% 2015 0.75%, which was based on long-dated US government bonds.
Provisions and contingent liabilities relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill are discussed in Note 2.
Information about the groups other provisions is provided in Note 22.
As further described in Note 32, the group is subject to claims and actions.
The facts and circumstances relating to particular cases are evaluated regularly in determining whether a provision relating to a specific litigation should be recognized or revised.
Accordingly, significant management judgement relating to provisions and contingent liabilities is required, since the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict.
Employee benefits Wages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the group.
Deferred bonus arrangements that have a vesting date more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are valued on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period until the award vests.
The accounting policies for share-based payments and for pensions and other post-retirement benefits are described below.
Share-based payments Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments on the date on which they are granted and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become fully entitled to the award.
A corresponding credit is recognized within equity.
Fair value is determined by using an appropriate, widely used, valuation model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the company market conditions.
Non-vesting conditions, such as the condition that employees contribute to a savings-related plan, are taken into account in the grant-date fair value, and failure to meet a non-vesting condition, where this is within the control of the employee is treated as a cancellation and any remaining unrecognized cost is expensed.
For other equity-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the corresponding increase in equity are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received unless their fair value cannot be reliably estimated.
If the fair value of the goods and services received cannot be reliably estimated, the transaction is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
Cash-settled transactions The cost of cash-settled transactions is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, measured by reference to the fair value of the corresponding liability which is recognized on the balance sheet.
The liability is remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date until settlement, with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The cost of providing benefits under the groups defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
Past service costs, resulting from either a plan amendment or a curtailment a reduction in future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership, are recognized immediately when the company becomes committed to a change.
Net interest expense relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefits, which is recognized in the income statement, represents the net change in present value of plan obligations and the value of plan assets resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the present value of the benefit obligation at the start of the year, and to the fair value of plan assets at the start of the year, taking into account expected changes in the obligation or plan assets during the year.
Remeasurements of the defined benefit liability and asset, comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest described above are recognized within other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently reclassified to profit and loss.
The defined benefit pension plan surplus or deficit recognized on the balance sheet for each plan comprises the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds and the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price.
Defined benefit pension plan surpluses are only recognized to the extent they are recoverable, typically by way of refund.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.
Significant estimate: pensions and other post-retirement benefits Accounting for defined benefit pensions and other post-retirement benefits involves making significant estimates about uncertain events, including retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, determination of discount rates for measuring plan obligations and net interest expense and assumptions for inflation rates.
134 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 Financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions continued Assumptions about these variables are based on the environment in each country.
The assumptions used may vary from year to year, which would affect future net income and net assets.
Any differences between these assumptions and the actual outcome also affect future net income and net assets.
Pension and other post-retirement benefit assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year.
These assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation at the year end and hence the surpluses and deficits recorded on the groups balance sheet, and pension and other post-retirement benefit expense for the following year.
The assumptions used are provided in Note 23.
The discount rate and inflation rate have a significant effect on the amounts reported.
A sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in these assumptions on the benefit expense and obligation is provided in Note 23.
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions.
Mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the countries in which we provide pensions and have been chosen with regard to applicable published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
A sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the mortality assumptions on the benefit expense and obligation is provided in Note 23.
Income taxes Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Interest and penalties relating to income tax are also included in the income tax expense.
Income tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is based on the taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it is determined in accordance with the rules established by the applicable taxation authorities.
It therefore excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods as well as items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences except: where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of goodwill where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, where the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized except where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Significant judgements and estimates: income taxes The computation of the groups income tax expense and liability involves the interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions throughout the world.
The resolution of tax positions taken by the group, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, can take several years to complete and in some cases it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome.
Therefore, judgement is required to determine provisions for income taxes.
In addition, the group has carry-forward tax losses and tax credits in certain taxing jurisdictions that are available to offset against future taxable profit.
However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or tax credits can be utilized.
Management judgement is exercised in assessing whether this is the case and estimates are required to be made of the amount of future taxable profits that will be available.
To the extent that actual outcomes differ from managements estimates, income tax charges or credits, and changes in current and deferred tax assets or liabilities, may arise in future periods.
For more information see Note 8.
Judgement is also required when determining whether a particular tax is an income tax or another type of tax for example a production tax.
Accounting for deferred tax is applied to income taxes as described above, but is not applied to other types of taxes: rather such taxes are recognized in the income statement on an appropriate basis.
BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 135 1.
Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions continued Customs duties and sales taxes Customs duties and sales taxes which are passed on to customers are excluded from revenues and expenses.
Assets and liabilities are recognized net of the amount of customs duties or sales tax except: Customs duties or sales taxes incurred on the purchase of goods and services which are not recoverable from the taxation authority are recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset.
Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of customs duty or sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included within receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
Own equity instruments treasury shares The groups holdings in its own equity instruments are shown as deductions from shareholders equity at cost.
Treasury shares represent BP shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes.
For accounting purposes, shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOPs to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the financial statements as treasury shares.
Consideration, if any, received for the sale of such shares is also recognized in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to the profit and loss account reserve.
No gain or loss is recognized in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Shares repurchased under the share buy-back programme which are immediately cancelled are not shown as treasury shares, but are shown as a deduction from the profit and loss account reserve in the group statement of changes in equity.
Revenue Revenue arising from the sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer, which is typically at the point that title passes, and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, customs duties and sales taxes.
Physical exchanges are reported net, as are sales and purchases made with a common counterparty, as part of an arrangement similar to a physical exchange.
Similarly, where the group acts as agent on behalf of a third party to procure or market energy commodities, any associated fee income is recognized but no purchase or sale is recorded.
Additionally, where forward sale and purchase contracts for oil, natural gas or power have been determined to be for short-term trading purposes, the associated sales and purchases are reported net within sales and other operating revenues whether or not physical delivery has occurred.
Generally, revenues from the production of oil and natural gas properties in which the group has an interest with joint operation partners are recognized on the basis of the groups working interest in those properties the entitlement method.
Differences between the production sold and the groups share of production are not significant.
Finance costs Finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
All other finance costs are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Impact of new International Financial Reporting Standards There are no new or amended standards or interpretations adopted during the year that have a significant impact on the financial statements.
Not yet adopted The following pronouncements from the IASB will become effective for future financial reporting periods and have not yet been adopted by the group.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments will supersede IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 covers classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers provides a single model for accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers, focusing on the identification and satisfaction of performance obligations, and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 will supersede IAS 18 Revenue.
BP expects to adopt IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018.
The groups evaluation of the effect of adoption of these standards is ongoing but it is not currently anticipated that either IFRS 9 or IFRS 15 will have a material effect on the financial statements.
The EU has adopted both IFRS 9 and IFRS 15.
IFRS 16 Leases provides a new model for lessee accounting in which all leases, other than short-term and small-ticket-item leases, will be accounted for by the recognition on the balance sheet of a right-to-use asset and a lease liability, and the subsequent amortization of the right-touse asset over the lease term.
IFRS 16 will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
BP expects to adopt IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019 using the modified retrospective approach to transition permitted by the standard in which the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard is recognized in opening retained earnings at the date of initial application.
The groups evaluation of the effect of adoption of the standard is ongoing but it is expected that it will have a material effect on the groups financial statements, significantly increasing the groups recognized assets and liabilities.
It is expected that the presentation and timing of recognitionof charges in the income statement will also change as the operating lease expense currently reported under IAS 17, typically on a straight-line basis, will be replaced by depreciation of the right-to-use asset and interest on the lease liability.
Information on the groups leases currently classified as operating leases, which are not recognized on the balance sheet, is provided in Note 27.
The EU has not yet adopted IFRS 16.
There are no other standards and interpretations in issue but not yet adopted that the directors anticipate will have a material effect on the reported income or net assets of the group.
Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill As a consequence of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in April 2010, BP continues to incur costs and has also recognized liabilities for certain future costs.
Following significant progress in resolving outstanding claims arising from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon accident and oil spill, a reliable estimate has now been determined for all remaining material liabilities arising from the incident.
136 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 Financial statements 2.
Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued The cumulative pre-tax income statement charge since the incident amounts to $62.6 billion.
For more information on the types of expenditure included in the cumulative income statement charge, see Impact upon the group income statement below.
It is now possible to reliably estimate the cost of resolving outstanding business economic loss claims under the Plaintiffs Steering Committee PSC settlement and the cost of resolving economic loss and property damage claims from individuals and businesses that either opted out of the PSC settlement and or were excluded from that settlement.
The pre-tax income statement charge for the year of $7.1 billion is primarily attributable to the recognition of additional provisions for these claims.
The impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement of the group are included within the relevant line items in those statements and are shown in the table below.

Trust fund BP established the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Trust the Trust, funded in the amount of $20 billion, to satisfy legitimate individual and business claims, state and local government claims resolved by BP, final judgments and settlements, state and local response costs, and natural resource damages and related costs.
Fines and penalties are not covered by the trust fund.
The funding of the Trust was completed in 2012.
The obligation to fund the $20-billion trust fund, adjusted to take account of the time value of money, was recognized in full in 2010 and charged to the income statement.
During 2014, cumulative charges to be paid by the Trust reached $20 billion.
Subsequent additional costs, over and above those provided within the $20 billion, are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
During the first half of 2016, the remaining cash in the Trust was exhausted and BP commenced paying claims and other costs previously funded from the Trust.
For certain costs, these payments are made by BP into qualified settlement funds administered by the PSC settlement programmes, which then distribute the amounts to claimants.
During 2016, BP paid $3,210 million to the qualified settlement funds.
Other payables Other payables include amounts payable under the agreements with the United States and five Gulf coast states that were approved by the federal district court in 2016, including amounts payable for natural resource damages, state claims and Clean Water Act penalties for full details BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 137 2.
Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued of these agreements, see BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2015.
Further, at 31 December 2016, $1,929 million remains in Other payables in relation to the 2012 agreement with the US government to resolve all federal criminal claims arising from the incident, of which $739 million falls due in 2017.
In addition, Other payables at 31 December 2016 includes BPs remaining commitment to fund the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative, which is a 10-year research programme to study the impact of the incident on the marine and shoreline environment of the Gulf of Mexico.
Amounts payable for certain economic loss and property damage claims from individuals and businesses that either opted out of the PSC settlement and or were excluded from that settlement, as well as certain business economic loss claims under the PSC settlement, are also included in Other payables.
Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions Provisions relating to the agreements with the United States and five Gulf coast states were reclassified to Other payables during 2016, upon approval of those agreements by the federal district court.
Remaining provisions relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill relate to litigation and claims.

Litigation and claims The litigation and claims provision includes amounts for the future cost of resolving claims by individuals and businesses for damage to real or personal property, lost profits or impairment of earning capacity and loss of subsistence use of natural resources.
Claims administration costs and legal costs have also been provided for.
Litigation and claims PSC settlement The Economic and Property Damages Settlement Agreement EPD Settlement Agreement with the PSC provides for a court-supervised settlement programme, the Deepwater Horizon Court Supervised Settlement Program DHCSSP, which commenced operation on 4 June 2012.
A separate claims administrator has been appointed to pay medical claims and to implement other aspects of the Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement.
For further information on the PSC settlements, see Legal proceedings on page 261.
The provision for the cost associated with the 2012 PSC settlement has been determined based upon an expected value of the remaining claims, including business economic loss claims.
During the year, significant progress was made in resolving business economic loss claims.
Claims were determined by the DHCSSP in accordance with the PSC settlement agreement and in addition, certain claims were settled by BP.
The provision has been increased in the year to reflect the estimate of the cost of the remaining claims which are expected to be determined and paid by the DHCSSP or resolved by BP, and associated costs.
Amounts to resolve remaining claims are expected to be substantially paid in 2017.
However, the amounts ultimately payable may differ from the amount provided and the timing of payment is uncertain.
Litigation and claims Other claims An estimate of the cost of the remaining economic loss and property damage claims from individuals and businesses that either opted out of the PSC settlement and or were excluded from that settlement, is recognized in provisions.
Amounts have been reclassified to Other payables during the year where settlements were agreed.
The 31 December 2015 provision recognized for litigation and claims included amounts agreed under the agreements with the United States and five Gulf Coast states in relation to state claims, which were reclassified to Other payables during 2016.
These state claims are payable over 18 years.

Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued Clean Water Act penalties The provision previously recognized for penalties under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, as determined by the civil settlement with the United States, was reclassified to Other payables during 2016 following approval by the Court of the Consent Decree.
The amount is payable in instalments over 15 years, commencing April 2017.
The unpaid balance of this penalty accrues interest at a fixed rate.
Provision movements The total amount recognized as an increase in provisions during the year was $6,440 million.
It is now possible to reliably estimate the cost of resolving outstanding business economic loss claims under the Plaintiffs Steering Committee PSC settlement and the cost of resolving economic loss and property damage claims from individuals and businesses that either opted out of the PSC settlement and or were excluded from that settlement, associated claims administration costs and other items.
The increase in provisions in 2016 relates primarily to the recognition of amounts for these items, which could not be reliably estimated and provided for in 2015.
After deducting amounts utilized during the year totalling $5,540 million, comprising payments from the trust fund and qualifying settlement fund of $3,453 million and payments made directly by BP of $2,087 million 2015 $3,279 million, comprising payments from the trust fund of $3,022 million and payments made directly by BP of $257 million, and after adjustments for discounting, the remaining provision as at 31 December 2016 was $2,442 million 2015 $16,507 million.
Contingent liabilities For information on Legal proceedings relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, see Legal proceedings on pages 261-264.
Impact upon the group income statement The group income statement for 2016 includes a pre-tax charge of $7,134 million 2015 pre-tax charge of $11,956 million in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
The costs charged within production and manufacturing expenses in 2016 include the amounts charged for provisions for business economic loss claims and economic loss and property damage claims from individuals and businesses that either opted out of the PSC settlement and or were excluded from that settlement, the cost of the securities claims settlement with the certified class of post-explosion ADS purchasers which was agreed in June 2016, as well as operating and other costs.
Finance costs of $494 million 2015 $247 million reflect the unwinding of the discount on payables and provisions.
The cumulative amount charged to the income statement to date comprises spill response costs arising in the aftermath of the incident, amounts charged for the agreements with the United States and five Gulf coast states that were approved by the federal district court in 2016, including amounts payable for natural resource damages, state claims and Clean Water Act penalties, operating costs, amounts charged upon initial recognition of the trust obligation, other litigation, claims, environmental and legal costs and estimated obligations for future costs, net of settlements agreed with the co-owners of the Macondo well and other third parties.

Impairments Impairment losses and impairment reversals in each segment are described below.
For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to impairments see Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill within Note 1.
Upstream Impairment losses and reversals related primarily to producing and midstream assets.
The 2016 impairment losses of $1,022 million related to a number of different assets, with the most significant charges arising in the North Sea.
Impairment losses within Upstream arose primarily as a result of revised cost estimates and decisions to dispose of certain assets.
On 3 April 2017, BP announced that it has agreed to sell its Forties Pipeline System business to INEOS for a consideration of up to $250 million.
The transaction will lead to an impairment charge of approximately $0.4 billion, which will be included in the group income statement for 2017.
The 2016 impairment reversals of $3,025 million primarily related to the North Sea and Angola.
The largest impairment reversals related to the Andrew area cash-generating unit CGU in the North Sea and the PSVM and Greater Plutonio CGUs in Angola but none of these were individually significant.
In addition an impairment reversal was recorded in relation to the Block KG D6 CGU in India: and exploration costs were also written back during the period see Note 7.
The impairment reversals arose following a reduction in the discount rate applied, changes to future price assumptions, and also increased confidence in the progress of the KG D6 projects in India.
See Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill within Note 1 for information on assumptions used for impairment testing.
The 2015 impairment losses of $2,484 million included $761 million in Angola, of which $371 million related to the Greater Plutonio CGU.
Impairment losses also included $830 million in relation to CGUs in the North Sea, of which $328 million related to the Andrew area CGU.
The impairment losses primarily arose as a result of a lower price environment in the near term, and were also affected to a lesser extent by certain technical reserves revisions and increases in decommissioning cost estimates.
The 2015 impairment reversals of $1,080 million included $945 million in the North Sea business, of which $473 million related to the Eastern Trough Area Project ETAP CGU.
The impairment reversals mainly arose as a result of decreases in cost estimates and a reduction in the discount rate applied, offsetting the impact of lower prices in the near term.
Impairment losses and reversals related to producing assets.
The discount rate used to determine the recoverable amount of the Greater Plutonio CGU included the 2% premium for higher-risk countries.
A premium was not applied in determining the recoverable amount of the other CGUs.
The 2014 impairment losses of $6,737 million included $4,876 million in relation to CGUs in the North Sea, of which $1,964 million related to the Valhall CGU, $660 million related to the Andrew area CGU, and $515 million related to the ETAP CGU.
Impairment losses also included an $859- million impairment of our PSVM CGU in Angola, and a $415-million impairment of the Block KG D6 CGU in India.
All of the impairments related to producing assets.
The impairments in the North Sea and Angola arose as a result of a lower price environment in the near term, technical reserves revisions, and increases in expected decommissioning cost estimates.
The impairment of Block KG D6 arose following the introduction of a new formula for Indian gas prices.
The discount rate used to determine the value in use of the PSVM CGU included the 2% premium for higher-risk countries.
Downstream The 2016 impairment losses of $84 million principally related to certain office buildings which are expected to be vacated.
The 2015 impairment losses of $265 million arose principally in relation to certain manufacturing assets in our petrochemicals business and certain US midstream assets, where the expected disposal proceeds were lower than the book values.
The 2014 impairment losses of $1,264 million principally related to our Bulwer Island refinery and certain midstream assets in our fuels business, and certain manufacturing assets in our petrochemicals business.
BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 141 4.
Disposals and impairment continued Other businesses and corporate Impairment losses totalling $11 million, $155 million, and $317 million were recognized in 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively.
The amount for 2015 was principally in respect of our US wind business.
The amount for 2014 was principally in respect of our biofuels businesses in the UK and US.
Segmental analysis The groups organizational structure reflects the various activities in which BP is engaged.
At 31 December 2016, BP had three reportable segments: Upstream, Downstream and Rosneft.
Upstreams activities include oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production: midstream transportation, storage and processing: and the marketing and trading of natural gas, including liquefied natural gas LNG, together with power and natural gas liquids NGLs.
Downstreams activities include the refining, manufacturing, marketing, transportation, and supply and trading of crude oil, petroleum, petrochemicals products and related services to wholesale and retail customers.
BPs interest in Rosneft is accounted for using the equity method and is reported as a separate operating segment, reflecting the way in which the investment is managed.
Other businesses and corporate comprises the biofuels and wind businesses, the groups shipping and treasury functions, and corporate activities worldwide.
The costs relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill were previously presented as a reconciling item between the sum of the results of the reportable segments and the group results.
From 2016, we have reported these costs as part of Other businesses and corporate.
Prior period comparatives have been amended to reflect this new presentation.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the groups accounting policies described in Note 1.
However, IFRS requires that the measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker for the purposes of performance assessment and resource allocation.
For BP, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit or a loss before interest and tax which reflects the replacement cost of supplies by excluding from profit or loss inventory holding gains and losses.
Replacement cost profit or loss for the group is not a recognized measure under IFRS.
Sales between segments are made at prices that approximate market prices, taking into account the volumes involved.
Segment revenues and segment results include transactions between business segments.
These transactions and any unrealized profits and losses are eliminated on consolidation, unless unrealized losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Sales to external customers by region are based on the location of the group subsidiary which made the sale.
The UK region includes the UK-based international activities of Downstream.
All surpluses and deficits recognized on the group balance sheet in respect of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are allocated to Other businesses and corporate.
However, the periodic expense relating to these plans is allocated to the operating segments based upon the business in which the employees work.
Certain financial information is provided separately for the US as this is an individually material country for BP, and for the UK as this is BPs country of domicile.
a Inventory holding gains and losses represent the difference between the cost of sales calculated using the replacement cost of inventory and the cost of sales calculated on the first-in first-out FIFO method after adjusting for any changes in provisions where the net realizable value of the inventory is lower than its cost.
Under the FIFO method, which we use for IFRS reporting, the cost of inventory charged to the income statement is based on its historical cost of purchase or manufacture, rather than its replacement cost.
In volatile energy markets, this can have a significant distorting effect on reported income.
The amounts disclosed represent the difference between the charge to the income statement for inventory on a FIFO basis after adjusting for any related movements in net realizable value provisions and the charge that would have arisen based on the replacement cost of inventory.
For this purpose, the replacement cost of inventory is calculated using data from each operations production and manufacturing system, either on a monthly basis, or separately for each transaction where the system allows this approach.
The amounts disclosed are not separately reflected in the financial statements as a gain or loss.
No adjustment is made in respect of the cost of inventories held as part of a trading position and certain other temporary inventory positions.

c The UK unused tax credits arise predominantly in overseas branches of UK entities based in jurisdictions with higher statutory corporate income tax rates than the UK.
No deferred tax asset has been recognized on these tax credits as they are unlikely to have value in the future: UK taxes on these overseas branches are largely mitigated by double tax relief in respect of overseas tax.
These tax credits have no fixed expiry date.

Earnings per ordinary share continued For the diluted earnings per share calculation, the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for the average number of shares that are potentially issuable in connection with employee share-based payment plans using the treasury stock method.
If the inclusion of potentially issuable shares would decrease loss per share, the potentially issuable shares are excluded from the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share.
A dilutive effect relating to potentially issuable shares has not been included, therefore, in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2015.

Employee share-based payment plans The group operates share and share option plans for directors and certain employees to obtain ordinary shares and ADSs in the company.
Information on these plans for directors is shown in the Directors remuneration report on pages 80-110.
The following table shows the number of shares potentially issuable under equity-settled employee share option plans, including the number of options outstanding, the number of options exercisable at the end of each year, and the corresponding weighted average exercise prices.

In addition, the group operates a number of equity-settled employee share plans under which share units are granted to the groups senior leaders and certain other employees.
These plans typically have a three-year performance or restricted period during which the units accrue net notional dividends which are treated as having been reinvested.
Leaving employment will normally preclude the conversion of units into shares, but special arrangements apply for participants that leave for qualifying reasons.

For Upstream, goodwill is allocated to all oil and gas assets in aggregate at the segment level.
For Downstream, goodwill has been allocated to Lubricants and Other.
Upstream $ million 2016 2015 Goodwill 7,726 7,812 Excess of recoverable amount over carrying amount 26,035 12,894 The table above shows the carrying amount of goodwill for the segment at year-end and the excess of the recoverable amount, based upon a fair value less costs of disposal calculation, over the carrying amount the headroom at the date of the test.
The fair value less costs of disposal is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by the projected oil or natural gas production profiles up to the expected dates of cessation of production of each producing field, based on current estimates of reserves and resources, appropriately risked for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
Midstream and supply and trading activities and equity-accounted entities are generally not included in the impairment review of goodwill, because they are not part of the grouping of cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates and which is used to monitor the goodwill for internal management purposes.
Where such activities form part of a wider Upstream cashgenerating unit, they are reflected in the test.
The fair value calculation is based primarily on level 3 inputs as defined by the IFRS 13 Fair value measurement hierarchy.
As the production profile and related cash flows can be estimated from BPs experience, management believes that the estimated cash flows expected to be generated over the life of each field is the appropriate basis upon which to assess goodwill for impairment.
The estimated date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the production profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, production costs, the contractual duration of the production concession and the selling price of the hydrocarbons produced.
As each producing field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the cash flows of the fields are computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions agreed by BP management.
Capital expenditure, operating costs and expected hydrocarbon production profiles are derived from the business segment plan.
Estimated production volumes and cash flows up to the date of cessation of production on a field-by-field basis are developed to be consistent with this.
The production profiles used are consistent with the reserve and resource volumes approved as part of BPs centrally controlled process for the estimation of proved and probable reserves and total resources.
Intangible assets are deemed to have a recoverable amount equal to their carrying amount.
The 2016 review for impairment was carried out during the third quarter following the change in price assumptions and discount rate as disclosed in Note 1.
In prior years the review was carried out during the fourth quarter.
In the absence of any indicators of impairment in other quarters, the review will be carried out in the third quarter in future years.
The key assumptions used in the fair value less costs of disposal calculation are oil and natural gas prices, production volumes and the discount rate.
Price assumptions and discount rate assumptions used were as disclosed in Note 1.
The fair value less costs of disposal calculations have been prepared solely for the purposes of determining whether the goodwill balance was impaired.
Estimated future cash flows were prepared on the basis of certain assumptions prevailing at the time of the test.
The actual outcomes may differ from the assumptions made.
For example, reserves and resources estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available and economic conditions change, and future commodity prices may differ from the forecasts used in the calculations.
Goodwill and impairment review of goodwill continued The sensitivities to different variables have been estimated using certain simplifying assumptions.
For example, lower oil and gas price sensitivities do not reflect the specific impacts for each contractual arrangement and will not capture fully any favourable impacts that may arise from cost deflation.
Therefore a detailed calculation at any given price or production profile may produce a different result.
It is estimated that if the oil price assumption for all future years the first five years, and the long-term assumption from 2022 onwards was approximately $13 per barrel lower in each year, this would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets of the segment.
It is estimated that if the gas price assumption for all future years was approximately $2 per mmBtu lower in each year, this would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets of the segment.
Estimated production volumes are based on detailed data for each field and take into account development plans agreed by management as part of the long-term planning process.
The average production for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing over the next 15 years is 889mmboe per year 2015 911mmboe per year.
It is estimated that if production volume were to be reduced by approximately 4% for this period, this would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets of the segment.
It is estimated that if the post-tax discount rate was approximately 9% for the entire portfolio, an increase of 3% for all countries not considered higher risk and 1% for countries considered higher risk, this would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets of the segment.
Downstream $ million 2016 2015 Lubricants Other Total Lubricants Other Total Goodwill 2,571 830 3,401 3,109 652 3,761 Cash flows for each cash-generating unit are derived from the business segment plans, which cover a period of two to five years.
To determine the value in use for each of the cash-generating units, cash flows for a period of 10 years are discounted and aggregated with a terminal value.
Lubricants As permitted by IAS 36, the detailed calculations of Lubricants recoverable amount performed in the most recent detailed calculation in 2013 were used for the 2016 impairment test as the criteria in that standard were considered satisfied: the headroom was substantial in 2013: there have been no significant changes in the assets and liabilities: and the likelihood that the recoverable amount would be less than the carrying amount at the time was remote.
The key assumptions to which the calculation of value in use for the Lubricants unit is most sensitive are operating unit margins, sales volumes, and discount rate.
The values assigned to these key assumptions reflect BPs experience.
No reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would cause the units carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
Cash flows beyond the two-year plan period were extrapolated using a nominal 3% growth rate.

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits Most group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans money purchase schemes or defined benefit plans final salary and other types of schemes with committed pension benefit payments.
For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as an employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Defined benefit plans may be funded or unfunded.
The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.
For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to accounting for these plans see Pensions and other post-retirement benefits within Note 1.
The primary pension arrangement in the UK is a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four company-nominated directors, an independent director and an independent chairman nominated by the company.
The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan.
The UK plan is closed to new joiners but remains open to ongoing accrual for current members.
New joiners in the UK are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.
In the US, all employees now accrue benefits under a cash balance formula.
Benefits previously accrued under final salary formulas are legally protected.
Retiring US employees typically take their pension benefit in the form of a lump sum payment upon retirement.
The plan is funded and its assets are overseen by a fiduciary Investment Committee composed of six BP employees appointed by the president of BP Corporation North America Inc. the appointing officer.
The Investment Committee is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as the investment policies of the plan.
US employees are also eligible to participate in a defined contribution 401k plan in which employee contributions are matched with company contributions.
In the US, group companies also provide post-retirement healthcare to retired employees and their dependants and, in certain cases, life insurance coverage : the entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until a specified age and completion of a minimum period of service.
In the Eurozone, there are defined benefit pension plans in Germany, France, the Netherlands and other countries.
In Germany and France, the majority of the pensions are unfunded, in line with market practice.
In Germany, the groups largest Eurozone plan, employees receive a pension and also have a choice to supplement their core pension through salary sacrifice.
For employees who joined since 2002 the core pension benefit is a career average plan with retirement benefits based on such factors as an employees pensionable salary and length of service.
The returns on the notional contributions made by both the company and employees are based on the interest rate which is set out in German tax law.
Retired German employees take their pension benefit typically in the form of an annuity.
The German plans are governed by legal agreements between BP and the works council or between BP and the trade union.
The level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
During 2016 the aggregate level of contributions was $651 million 2015 $1,066 million and 2014 $1,252 million.
The aggregate level of contributions in 2017 is expected to be approximately $1,050 million, and includes contributions in all countries that we expect to be required to make contributions by law or under contractual agreements, as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.
For the primary UK plan there is a funding agreement between the group and the trustee.
On an annual basis the latest funding position is reviewed and a schedule of contributions covering the next seven years is agreed.
The funding agreement can be terminated unilaterally by either party with two years notice.
Contractually committed funding therefore represents nine years of future contributions, which amounted to $5,761 million at 31 December 2016, of which $2,410 million relates to past service.
This amount is included in the groups committed cash BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 157 23.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued flows relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefit plans as set out in the table of contractual obligations on page 243.
The surplus relating to the primary UK pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any remaining assets once all members have left the plan.
Pension contributions in the US are determined by legislation and are supplemented by discretionary contributions.
All of the contributions made into the US pension plan in 2016 were discretionary and no statutory funding requirement is expected in the next 12 months.
There was no minimum funding requirement for the US plan, and no significant minimum funding requirements in other countries at 31 December 2016.
The obligation and cost of providing pensions and other post-retirement benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method.
The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2016.
The UK plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years: valuations are required more frequently in many other countries.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the UK pension plans was as at 31 December 2014.
A valuation of the US plan is carried out annually.
The material financial assumptions used to estimate the benefit obligations of the various plans are set out below.
The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year, and are used to evaluate the accrued benefit obligation at 31 December and pension expense for the following year.
% Financial assumptions used to determine benefit obligation UK US Eurozone 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 Discount rate for plan liabilities 2.7 3.9 3.6 3.9 4.0 3.7 1.7 2.4 2.0 Rate of increase in salaries 4.6 4.4 4.5 4.2 3.9 4.0 3.0 3.2 3.4 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.0 3.0 3.0 1.5 1.6 1.8 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.0 3.0 3.0 0.5 0.6 0.7 Inflation for plan liabilities 3.2 3.0 3.0 1.8 1.5 1.6 1.6 1.8 2.0 % Financial assumptions used to determine benefit expense UK US Eurozone 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 Discount rate for plan service cost 4.0 3.9 4.8 4.2 3.8 4.6 2.7 2.3 3.9 Discount rate for plan other finance expense 3.9 3.6 4.6 4.0 3.7 4.3 2.4 2.0 3.6 Inflation for plan service cost 3.1 3.1 3.4 1.5 1.6 2.1 1.8 2.0 2.0 The discount rate assumptions are based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and for our largest plans in the UK, US and the Eurozone we use yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments.
The inflation rate assumptions for our UK and US plans are based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds.
In other countries, including the Eurozone, we use this approach, or advice from the local actuary depending on the information available.
The inflation assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase.
For 2016 the assumed rate of increase for the UK plans also reflects the probability of exceeding a cap or breaching a floor for pension increases as set out in the plan rules: this change resulted in a reduction in the pension obligation of $865 million.
The assumptions for the rate of increase in salaries are based on the inflation assumption plus an allowance for expected long-term real salary growth.
These include allowance for promotion-related salary growth, of up to 0.8% depending on country.
The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the countries in which we provide pensions, and have been chosen with regard to applicable published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
BPs most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK, the US and the Eurozone where our mortality assumptions are as follows: Years Mortality assumptions UK US Eurozone 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60 28.0 28.5 28.3 25.7 25.7 25.6 25.0 24.9 24.7 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 30.0 31.0 30.9 27.5 27.5 27.4 27.6 27.5 27.3 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 29.5 29.5 29.4 29.3 29.2 29.1 28.9 28.8 28.7 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 31.9 31.9 31.8 31.0 30.9 30.9 31.3 31.2 31.1 Pension plan assets are generally held in trusts.
The primary objective of the trusts is to accumulate pools of assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the various plans.
The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.
A significant proportion of the assets are held in equities, which are expected to generate a higher level of return over the long term, with an acceptable level of risk.
In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.
For the primary UK pension plan there is an agreement with the trustee to reduce the proportion of plan assets held as equities and increase the proportion held as bonds over time, with a view to better matching the asset portfolio with the pension liabilities.
There is a similar agreement in place in the US.
During 2016, the UK and the US plans switched 4% and nil respectively from equities to bonds.
BPs primary plan in the UK uses a liability driven investment LDI approach for part of the portfolio, a form of investing designed to match the movement in pension plan assets with the impact of interest rate changes and inflation assumption changes on the projected benefit obligation.

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued The current asset allocation policy for the major plans at 31 December 2016 was as follows: UK US Asset category %% Total equity including private equity 58 55 Bonds cash including LDI 35 45 Property real estate 7 The amounts invested under the LDI programme as at 31 December 2016 were $423 million 2015 $329 million of government-issued nominal bonds and $9,384 million 2015 $6,421 million of index-linked bonds.
This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, proceeds from which are shown separately in the table below.
In addition, the primary UK plan entered into interest rate swaps in the year to offset the long-term fixed interest rate exposure for $4,450 million 2015 $2,651 million of the corporate bond portfolio.
At 31 December 2016 the fair value liability of these swaps was $144 million 2015 $17 million fair value asset and is included in other assets in the table below.
Some of the groups pension plans in other countries also use derivative financial instruments as part of their asset mix to manage the level of risk.
The groups main pension plans do not invest directly in either securities or property real estate of the company or of any subsidiary.
The fair values of the various categories of assets held by the defined benefit plans at 31 December are presented in the table below, including the effects of derivative financial instruments.
Movements in the fair value of plan assets during the year are shown in detail in the table on page 160.
Property held by the UK pension plans is in the United Kingdom.

These balances are not included as part of the pension surpluses and deficits, but are reflected within other receivables and other payables in the group balance sheet.
Sensitivity analysis The discount rate, inflation, salary growth and the mortality assumptions all have a significant effect on the amounts reported.
A one-percentage point change, in isolation, in certain assumptions as at 31 December 2016 for the groups plans would have had the effects shown in the table below.
The effects shown for the expense in 2017 comprise the total of current service cost and net finance income or expense.

b The amounts presented reflect the total impact of an inflation rate change on the assumptions for rate of increase in salaries, pensions in payment and deferred pensions.
One additional year of longevity in the mortality assumptions would increase the 2017 pension and other post-retirement benefit expense by $55 million and the pension and other post-retirement benefit obligation at 31 December 2016 by $1,558 million.

We maintain our financial framework to support the pursuit of value growth for shareholders, while ensuring a secure financial base.
The group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt ratio, that is, the ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity.
Net debt is calculated as gross finance debt, as shown in the balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risks relating to finance debt, for which hedge accounting is applied, less cash and cash equivalents.
Net debt and net debt ratio are non-GAAP measures.
BP believes these measures provide useful information to investors.
Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of gross debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total.
The net debt ratio enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to equity from shareholders.
The derivatives are reported on the balance sheet within the headings Derivative financial instruments.
All components of equity are included in the denominator of the calculation.
We aim to manage the net debt ratio within a 20-30% band while weak market conditions remain and maintain a significant liquidity buffer.

Operating leases The cost recognized in relation to minimum lease payments for the year was $5,113 million 2015 $6,008 million and 2014 $6,324 million.
The future minimum lease payments at 31 December 2016, before deducting related rental income from operating sub-leases of $186 million 2015 $166 million, are shown in the table below.
This does not include future contingent rentals.
Where the lease rentals are dependent on a variable factor, the future minimum lease payments are based on the factor as at inception of the lease.

These net amounts are after deducting amounts reimbursed, or to be reimbursed, by joint operators, whether the joint operators have co-signed the lease or not.
Where BP is not the operator of a joint operation, BPs share of the lease expense and future minimum lease payments is included in the amounts shown, whether BP has co-signed the lease or not.
Typical durations of operating leases are up to forty years for leases of land and buildings, up to fifteen years for leases of ships and commercial vehicles and up to ten years for leases of plant and machinery.
The group has entered into a number of structured operating leases for ships and in some cases the lease rental payments vary with market interest rates.
The variable portion of the lease payments above or below the amount based on the market interest rate prevailing at inception of the lease is treated as contingent rental expense.
The group also routinely enters into bareboat charters, time-charters and voyage-charters for ships on standard industry terms.
The most significant items of plant and machinery hired under operating leases are international oil and gas ships managed by the BP Shipping function and drilling rigs used in the Upstream segment.
At 31 December 2016, the future minimum lease payments relating to these amounted to $3,582 million 2015 $3,036 million and $2,969 million 2015 $4,783 million respectively.
164 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 Financial statements 27.
Operating leases continued Commercial vehicles hired under operating leases are primarily railcars.
Retail service station sites and office accommodation are the main items in the land and buildings category.
The terms and conditions of these operating leases do not impose any significant financial restrictions on the group.
Some of the leases of ships and buildings allow for renewals at BPs option, and some of the groups operating leases contain escalation clauses.
Financial instruments and financial risk factors The accounting classification of each category of financial instruments, and their carrying amounts, are set out below.

For all other financial instruments, the carrying amount is either the fair value, or approximates the fair value.
Financial risk factors The group is exposed to a number of different financial risks arising from natural business exposures as well as its use of financial instruments including market risks relating to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates: credit risk: and liquidity risk.
The group financial risk committee GFRC advises the group chief financial officer CFO who oversees the management of these risks.
The GFRC is chaired by the CFO and consists of a group of senior managers including the group treasurer and the heads of the group finance, tax and the integrated supply and trading functions.
The purpose of the committee is to advise on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the group.
The committee provides assurance to the CFO and the group chief executive GCE, and via the GCE to the board, that the groups financial risk-taking activity is governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with group policies and group risk appetite.
The groups trading activities in the oil, natural gas, LNG and power markets are managed within the integrated supply and trading function, while the activities in the financial markets are managed by the treasury function, working under the compliance and control structure of the integrated supply and trading function.
All derivative activity is carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision.
These teams are subject to close financial and management control.
The integrated supply and trading function maintains formal governance processes that provide oversight of market risk, credit risk and operational risk associated with trading activity.
A policy and risk committee monitors and validates limits and risk exposures, reviews incidents and validates risk-related policies, methodologies and procedures.
A commitments committee approves value-at-risk delegations, the trading of new products, instruments and strategies and material commitments.
In addition, the integrated supply and trading function undertakes derivative activity for risk management purposes under a control framework as described more fully below.
Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued a Market risk Market risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from possible market price movements and their impact on the future performance of a business.
The primary commodity price risks that the group is exposed to include oil, natural gas and power prices that could adversely affect the value of the groups financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.
The group enters into derivatives in a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation.
In addition, the group has developed a control framework aimed at managing the volatility inherent in certain of its natural business exposures.
In accordance with the control framework the group enters into various transactions using derivatives for risk management purposes.
The major components of market risk are commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk, each of which is discussed below.
i Commodity price risk The groups integrated supply and trading function uses conventional financial and commodity instruments and physical cargoes and pipeline positions available in the related commodity markets.
Oil and natural gas swaps, options and futures are used to mitigate price risk.
Power trading is undertaken using a combination of over-the-counter forward contracts and other derivative contracts, including options and futures.
This activity is on both a standalone basis and in conjunction with gas derivatives in relation to gas-generated power margin.
In addition, NGLs are traded around certain US inventory locations using over-the-counter forward contracts in conjunction with over-the-counter swaps, options and physical inventories.
The group measures market risk exposure arising from its trading positions in liquid periods using value-at-risk techniques.
These techniques make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market prices over a one-day holding period.
The valueat-risk measure is supplemented by stress testing.
Trading activity occurring in liquid periods is subject to value-at-risk limits for each trading activity and for this trading activity in total.
The board has delegated a limit of $100 million value at risk in support of this trading activity.
Alternative measures are used to monitor exposures which are outside liquid periods and which cannot be actively risk-managed.
ii Foreign currency exchange risk Where the group enters into foreign currency exchange contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using trading value-at-risk techniques as explained above.
Since BP has global operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the groups reported results.
The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are absorbed in business operating results through changing cost competitiveness, lags in market adjustment to movements in rates and translation differences accounted for on specific transactions.
For this reason, the total effect of exchange rate fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the groups reported results.
The main underlying economic currency of the groups cash flows is the US dollar.
This is because BPs major product, oil, is priced internationally in US dollars.
BPs foreign currency exchange management policy is to limit economic and material transactional exposures arising from currency movements against the US dollar.
The group co-ordinates the handling of foreign currency exchange risks centrally, by netting off naturally-occurring opposite exposures wherever possible and then managing any material residual foreign currency exchange risks.
The group manages these exposures by constantly reviewing the foreign currency economic value at risk and aims to manage such risk to keep the 12-month foreign currency value at risk below $400 million.
At no point over the past three years did the value at risk exceed the maximum risk limit.
The most significant exposures relate to capital expenditure commitments and other UK, Eurozone and Australian operational requirements, for which hedging programmes are in place and hedge accounting is applied as outlined in Note 1.
For highly probable forecast capital expenditures the group fixes the US dollar cost of non-US dollar supplies by using currency forwards.
The exposures are sterling, euro, Australian dollar and Norwegian krone.
At 31 December 2016 the most significant open contracts in place were for $1,204 million sterling 2015 $627 million sterling.
For other UK, Eurozone and Australian operational requirements the group uses cylinders purchased call and sold put options to manage the estimated exposures on a 12-month rolling basis.
At 31 December 2016, the open positions relating to cylinders consisted of receive sterling, pay US dollar cylinders for $1,885 million 2015 $2,479 million : receive euro, pay US dollar cylinders for $585 million 2015 $560 million : receive Australian dollar, pay US dollar cylinders for $274 million 2015 $312 million.
In addition, most of the groups borrowings are in US dollars or are hedged with respect to the US dollar.
At 31 December 2016, the total foreign currency borrowings not swapped into US dollars net of those hedged with cash in the same currency expected to be held until the maturity of those borrowings amounted to $809 million 2015 $826 million.
iii Interest rate risk Where the group enters into money market contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using value-at-risk techniques as described above.
BP is also exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments, principally finance debt.
While the group issues debt in a variety of currencies based on market opportunities, it uses derivatives to swap the debt to a floating rate exposure, mainly to US dollar floating, but in certain defined circumstances maintains a US dollar fixed rate exposure for a proportion of debt.
The proportion of floating rate debt net of interest rate swaps at 31 December 2016 was 84% of total finance debt outstanding 2015 79%.
The weighted average interest rate on finance debt at 31 December 2016 was 2% 2015 2% and the weighted average maturity of fixed rate debt was five years 2015 five years.
The groups earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the floating rate element of the groups finance debt.
If the interest rates applicable to floating rate instruments were to have increased by one percentage point on 1 January 2017, it is estimated that the groups finance costs for 2017 would increase by approximately $488 million 2015 $419 million increase.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due causing financial loss to the group and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with financial institutions and principally from credit exposures to customers relating to outstanding receivables.
Credit exposure also exists in relation to guarantees issued by group companies under which the outstanding exposure incremental to that recognized on the balance sheet at 31 December 2016 was $309 million 2015 $35 million in respect of liabilities of joint ventures and associates and $370 million 2015 $163 million in respect of liabilities of other third parties.
166 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 Financial statements 28.
Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued The group has a credit policy, approved by the CFO that is designed to ensure that consistent processes are in place throughout the group to measure and control credit risk.
Credit risk is considered as part of the risk-reward balance of doing business.
On entering into any business contract the extent to which the arrangement exposes the group to credit risk is considered.
Key requirements of the policy include segregation of credit approval authorities from any sales, marketing or trading teams authorized to incur credit risk: the establishment of credit systems and processes to ensure that all counterparty exposure is rated and that all counterparty exposure and limits can be monitored and reported: and the timely identification and reporting of any non-approved credit exposures and credit losses.
While each segment is responsible for its own credit risk management and reporting consistent with group policy, the treasury function holds group-wide credit risk authority and oversight responsibility for exposure to banks and financial institutions.
The maximum credit exposure associated with financial assets is equal to the carrying amount.
The group does not aim to remove credit risk entirely but expects to experience a certain level of credit losses.
As at 31 December 2016, the group had in place credit enhancements designed to mitigate approximately $11.6 billion of credit risk 2015 $10.9 billion.
Reports are regularly prepared and presented to the GFRC that cover the groups overall credit exposure and expected loss trends, exposure by segment, and overall quality of the portfolio.
Management information used to monitor credit risk indicates that 79% 2015 81% of total unmitigated credit exposure relates to counterparties of investment-grade credit quality.

The groups liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and currency requirements to the central treasury function.
Unless restricted by local regulations, generally subsidiaries pool their cash surpluses to the treasury function, which will then arrange to fund other subsidiaries requirements, or invest any net surplus in the market or arrange for necessary external borrowings, while managing the groups overall net currency positions.
Standard & Poors Ratings long-term credit rating for BP is A negative stable outlook and Moodys Investors Service rating is A2 positive outlook.
During 2016, $12 billion of long-term taxable bonds were issued with terms ranging from three to twelve years.
Commercial paper is issued at competitive rates to meet short-term borrowing requirements as and when needed.
As a further liquidity measure, the group continues to maintain suitable levels of cash and cash equivalents, amounting to $23.5 billion at 31 December 2016 2015 $26.4 billion, primarily invested with highly rated banks or money market funds and readily accessible at immediate and short notice.
At 31 December 2016, the group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities available, consisting of $7,375 million of standby facilities, of which $6,975 million is available to draw and repay until the first half of 2018, and $400 million is available to draw and repay until April 2017.
These facilities are with 26 international banks, and borrowings under them would be at pre-agreed rates.
The group also has committed letter of credit LC facilities totalling $6,750 million with a number of banks, allowing LCs to be issued for a maximum two-year duration.
There were also uncommitted secured LC facilities in place at 31 December 2016 for $2,410 million, which are secured against inventories or receivables when utilized.
The facilities only terminate by either party giving a stipulated termination notice to the other.
Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued The amounts shown for finance debt in the table below include future minimum lease payments with respect to finance leases.
The table also shows the timing of cash outflows relating to trade and other payables and accruals.
The group manages liquidity risk associated with derivative contracts, other than derivative hedging instruments, based on the expected maturities of both derivative assets and liabilities as indicated in Note 29.
Management does not currently anticipate any cash flows that could be of a significantly different amount, or could occur earlier than the expected maturity analysis provided.
The table below shows the timing of cash outflows for derivative financial instruments entered into for the purpose of managing interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk associated with net debt, whether or not hedge accounting is applied, based upon contractual payment dates.
The amounts reflect the gross settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately from the receive leg, as in the case of cross-currency swaps hedging non-US dollar finance debt.
The swaps are with high investment-grade counterparties and therefore the settlement-day risk exposure is considered to be negligible.
Not shown in the table are the gross settlement amounts inflows for the receive leg of derivatives that are settled separately from the pay leg, which amount to $18,014 million at 31 December 2016 2015 $15,706 million to be received on the same day as the related cash outflows.
For further information on our derivative financial instruments, see Note 29.
Derivative financial instruments In the normal course of business the group enters into derivative financial instruments derivatives to manage its normal business exposures in relation to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt, consistent with risk management policies and objectives.
An outline of the groups financial risks and the objectives and policies pursued in relation to those risks is set out in Note 28.
Additionally, the group has a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation that is undertaken in conjunction with these activities using a similar range of contracts.
For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to the application of hedge accounting and the valuation of derivatives see Derivative financial instruments within Note 1.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments at 31 December are set out below.
Exchange traded derivatives are valued using closing prices provided by the exchange as at the balance sheet date.
These derivatives are categorized within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Over-the-counter OTC financial swaps and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are generally valued using readily available information in the public markets and quotations provided by brokers and price index developers.
These quotes are corroborated with market data and are categorized within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
In certain less liquid markets, or for longer-term contracts, forward prices are not as readily available.
In these circumstances, OTC financial swaps and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical relationships between various commodities, and that result in managements best estimate of fair value.
These contracts are categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
168 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 Financial statements 29.
Derivative financial instruments continued Financial OTC and physical commodity options are valued using industry standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic factors.
The degree to which these inputs are observable in the forward markets determines whether the option is categorized within level 2 or level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The contracts may be entered into for risk management purposes, to satisfy supply requirements or for entrepreneurial trading.
Certain contracts are classified as held for trading, regardless of their original business objective, and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.
Trading activities are undertaken by using a range of contract types in combination to create incremental gains by arbitraging prices between markets, locations and time periods.
The net of these exposures is monitored using market value-at-risk techniques as described in Note 28.
The following tables show further information on the fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments held for trading purposes.
Derivative assets held for trading have the following fair values and maturities.
The sale agreement contained an embedded derivative the whole agreement has, consequently, been designated at fair value through profit or loss and shown within other derivatives held for trading, and falls within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Derivative gains and losses Gains and losses relating to derivative contracts are included within sales and other operating revenues in the income statement depending upon the nature of the activity and type of contract involved.
The contract types treated in this way include futures, options, swaps and certain forward sales and forward purchases contracts, and relate to both currency and commodity trading activities.
Gains or losses arise on contracts entered into for risk management purposes, optimization activity and entrepreneurial trading.
They also arise on certain contracts that are for normal procurement or sales activity for the group but that are required to be fair valued under accounting standards.
Also included within sales and other operating revenues are gains and losses on inventory held for trading purposes.
The total amount relating to all these items excluding gains and losses on realized physical derivative contracts that have been reflected gross in the income statement within sales and purchases was a net gain of $1,435 million 2015 $5,508 million net gain and 2014 $6,154 million net gain.
This number does not include gains and losses on realized physical derivative contracts that have been reflected gross in the income statement within sales and purchases or the change in value of transportation and storage contracts which are not recognized under IFRS, but does include the associated financially settled contracts.
The net amount for actual gains and losses relating to derivative contracts and all related items therefore differs significantly from the amount disclosed above.
Embedded derivatives The group has embedded derivatives relating to certain natural gas contracts.
The fair value gain on commodity price embedded derivatives included within distribution and administration expenses was a gain of $32 million 2015 gain of $120 million, 2014 gain of $430 million.
Cash flow hedges At 31 December 2016, the group held currency forwards, futures contracts and cylinders and cross-currency interest rate swaps that were being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of highly probable forecast transactions and floating rate finance debt.
Note 28 outlines the groups approach to foreign currency exchange risk management.
For cash flow hedges the group only claims hedge accounting for the intrinsic value on the currency with any fair value attributable to time value taken immediately to the income statement.
The amounts remaining in equity at 31 December 2016 in relation to these cash flow hedges consist of deferred losses of $343 million maturing in 2017, deferred losses of $71 million maturing in 2018 and deferred losses of $22 million maturing in 2019 and beyond.
Fair value hedges At 31 December 2016, the group held interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk on fixed rate debt issued by the group.
The loss on the hedging derivative instruments recognized in the income statement in 2016 was $316 million 2015 $788 million loss and 2014 $14 million loss offset by a gain on the fair value of the finance debt of $270 million 2015 $833 million gain and 2014 $8 million gain.
The interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps mature within one to twelve years, and have the same maturity terms as the debt that they are hedging.
They are used to convert sterling, euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Norwegian krone and Hong Kong dollar denominated fixed rate borrowings into floating rate debt.
Note 28 outlines the groups approach to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management.

Treasury shares Treasury shares represent BP shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes.
For accounting purposes shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOPs and BPs US share plan administrator to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the financial statements as treasury shares.
The ESOPs are funded by the group and have waived their rights to dividends in respect of such shares held for future awards.
Until such time as the shares held by the ESOPs vest unconditionally to employees, the amount paid for those shares is shown as a reduction in shareholders equity.
Assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and liabilities of the group.
Foreign currency translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations.
Upon disposal of foreign operations, the related accumulated exchange differences are recycled to the income statement.
Available-for-sale investments This reserve records the changes in fair value of available-for-sale investments except for impairment losses, foreign exchange gains or losses, or changes arising from revised estimates of future cash flows.
On disposal or impairment of the investments, the cumulative changes in fair value are recycled to the income statement.

Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill See Note 2 for information on contingent liabilities related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
Contingent liabilities not related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill There were contingent liabilities at 31 December 2016 in respect of guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the ordinary course of the groups business.
No material losses are likely to arise from such contingent liabilities.
Further information on financial guarantees is included in Note 28.
In the normal course of the groups business, legal proceedings are pending or may be brought against BP group entities arising out of current and past operations, including matters related to commercial disputes, product liability, antitrust, commodities trading, premises-liability claims, consumer protection, general environmental claims and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances, such as lead pigment in paint, asbestos and other chemicals.
BP believes that the impact of these legal proceedings on the groups results of operations, liquidity or financial position will not be material.
With respect to lead pigment in paint in particular, Atlantic Richfield, a subsidiary of BP, has been named as a co-defendant in numerous lawsuits brought in the US alleging injury to persons and property.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the legal proceedings, Atlantic Richfield believes it has valid defences that render the incurrence of a liability remote: however, the amounts claimed and the costs of implementing the remedies sought in the various cases could be substantial.
The majority of the lawsuits have been abandoned or dismissed against Atlantic Richfield.
No lawsuit against Atlantic Richfield has been settled nor has Atlantic Richfield been subject to a final adverse judgment in any proceeding.
Atlantic Richfield intends to defend such actions vigorously.
The group files tax returns in many jurisdictions throughout the world.
Various tax authorities are currently examining the groups tax returns.
Tax returns contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations and the resolution of tax positions through negotiations with relevant tax authorities, or through litigation, can take several years to complete.
While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, the group does not anticipate that there will be any material impact upon the groups results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
Contingent liabilities continued The group is subject to numerous national and local environmental laws and regulations concerning its products, operations and other activities.
These laws and regulations may require the group to take future action to remediate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemicals or petroleum substances by the group or other parties.
Such contingencies may exist for various sites including refineries, chemical plants, oil fields, service stations, terminals and waste disposal sites.
In addition, the group may have obligations relating to prior asset sales or closed facilities.
The ultimate requirement for remediation and its cost are inherently difficult to estimate.
However, the estimated cost of known environmental obligations has been provided in these accounts in accordance with the groups accounting policies.
While the amounts of future costs that are not provided for could be significant and could be material to the groups results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, it is not possible to estimate the amounts involved.
BP does not expect these costs to have a material effect on the groups financial position or liquidity.
If oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines are sold to third parties and the subsequent owner is unable to meet their decommissioning obligations it is possible that, in certain circumstances, BP could be partially or wholly responsible for decommissioning.
BP is not currently aware of any such cases that have a greater than remote chance of reverting to the Group.
Furthermore, as described in Provisions and contingencies within Note 1, decommissioning provisions associated with downstream and petrochemical facilities are not generally recognized as the potential obligations cannot be measured given their indeterminate settlement dates.

Oil and gas reserves certain definitions Unless the context indicates otherwise, the following terms have the meanings shown below: Proved oil and gas reserves Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
i The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes: A The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any: and B Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
ii In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons LKH as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
iii Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil HKO elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
iv Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques including, but not limited to, fluid injection are included in the proved classification when: A Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favourable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed programme in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or programme was based: and B The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
v Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined.
The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the  price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
Undeveloped oil and gas reserves Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
i Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
ii Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.
iii Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
Developed oil and gas reserves Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered: i Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well: and ii Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
For details on BPs proved reserves and production compliance and governance processes, see pages 251-256.

This information is prepared in compliance with FASB Oil and Gas Disclosures requirements.
Future net cash flows have been prepared on the basis of certain assumptions which may or may not be realized.
These include the timing of future production, the estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves and the application of average crude oil and natural gas prices and exchange rates from the previous 12 months.
Furthermore, both proved reserves estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available and economic conditions change.
BP cautions against relying on the information presented because of the highly arbitrary nature of the assumptions on which it is based and its lack of comparability with the historical cost information presented in the financial statements.

212 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 Financial statements Operational and statistical information continued Productive oil and gas wells and acreage The following tables show the number of gross and net productive oil and natural gas wells and total gross and net developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas acreage in which the group and its equity-accounted entities had interests as at 31 December 2016.
A gross well or acre is one in which a whole or fractional working interest is owned, while the number of net wells or acres is the sum of the whole or fractional working interests in gross wells or acres.
Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production.
Developed acreage is the acreage within the boundary of a field, on which development wells have been drilled, which could produce the reserves: while undeveloped acres are those on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities, whether or not such acres contain proved reserves.
c Includes approximately 8,367 gross 1,632 net multiple completion wells more than one formation producing into the same well bore.
d Includes approximately 2,825 gross 1,437 net multiple completion wells.
If one of the multiple completions in a well is an oil completion, the well is classified as an oil well.
e Undeveloped acreage includes leases and concessions.
Net oil and gas wells completed or abandoned The following table shows the number of net productive and dry exploratory and development oil and natural gas wells completed or abandoned in the years indicated by the group and its equity-accounted entities.
Productive wells include wells in which hydrocarbons were encountered and the drilling or completion of which, in the case of exploratory wells, has been suspended pending further drilling or evaluation.
A dry well is one found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to justify completion.

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions Authorization of financial statements and statement of compliance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101 The financial statements of BP p. l. c. for the year ended 31 December 2016 were approved and signed by the group chief executive on 6 April 2017 having been duly authorized to do so by the board of directors.
The company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements FRS 100 issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
Accordingly, these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting standards.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
As permitted by FRS 101, the company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available in relation to: a the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: b the requirements of paragraphs 10 d, 10 f, 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D, 111 and 134 to 136 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: c the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows: d the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors in relation to standards not yet effective: e the requirements of paragraphs 17 and 18A of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures: and f the requirements of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements of BP p. l. c. As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the company is not presented as part of these financial statements.
As permitted by FRS 101 from 1 January 2016, the company has adopted the balance sheet format set out in IAS 1 rather than the Companies Act 2006 format that was previously used.
This provides greater consistency with the consolidated financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million dollars $ million, except where otherwise indicated.
Significant accounting policies: use of judgements, estimates and assumptions Inherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements is the need for management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
The accounting judgements and estimates that could have a significant impact on the results of the company are set out in boxed text below, and should be read in conjunction with the information provided in the Notes on financial statements.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost.
The company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Significant estimate or judgement: investments The recoverable amount, which is often the fair value less costs to sell, may be based upon discounted future cash flows.
The assumptions underlying these calculations, such as the discount rate, future oil and gas prices, and other asset specific factors, are judgemental.
Further information on the assumptions that are used in such calculations is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currency translation The functional and presentation currency of the financial statements is US dollars.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction.
Any resulting exchange differences are included in the income statement.
Exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by a non-US dollar functional currency branch are translated into US dollars are recognized in a separate component of equity and reported in other comprehensive income.
Income statement transactions are translated into US dollars using the average exchange rate for the reporting period.
Financial guarantees The company enters into financial guarantee contracts with its subsidiaries.
At the inception of a financial guarantee contract, a liability is recognized initially at fair value and then subsequently at the higher of the estimated loss and amortized cost.
Where a guarantee is issued for a premium, a receivable of an amount equal to the liability is initially recognized.
Subsequently, the liability and receivable reduce by the amount of consideration received, which is recognized in the income statement.
Where a guarantee is issued without a premium, the fair value is recognized as additional investment in the entity to which the guarantee relates.
BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 217 1.
Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions continued Share-based payments Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees of the company and other members of the group is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments on the date on which they are granted and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become fully entitled to the award.
Non-vesting conditions, such as the condition that employees contribute to a savings-related plan, are taken into account in the grant-date fair value, and failure to meet a non-vesting condition, where this is within the control of the employee, is treated as a cancellation and any remaining unrecognized cost is expensed.
For other equity-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the corresponding increase in equity are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received.
Pensions The cost of providing benefits under the companys defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
Net interest expense relating to pensions, which is recognized in the income statement, represents the net change in present value of plan obligations and the value of plan assets resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the present value of the benefit obligation at the start of the year, and to the fair value of plan assets at the start of the year, taking into account expected changes in the obligation or plan assets during the year.
Significant estimate: pensions Accounting for defined benefit pensions involves making significant estimates about uncertain events, including retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, determination of discount rates for measuring plan obligations and net interest expense and assumptions for inflation rates.
Assumptions about these variables are based on the environment in each country.
Pension assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year.
These assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation at the year end and hence the surpluses and deficits recorded on the companys balance sheet, and pension expense for the following year.
The assumptions used are provided in Note 4.
Mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the UK and have been chosen with regard to applicable published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the plan and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
A sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the mortality assumptions on the benefit expense and obligation is provided in Note 4.
The companys liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be realized in the future.
218 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2016 Financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions continued Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Significant estimate or judgement: deferred tax Management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits.
Financial assets All financial assets held by the company are classified as loans and receivables.
Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, receivables and other investments.
The company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price plus directly attributable transaction costs.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities held by the company are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost.
Financial liabilities include other payables, accruals, and most items of finance debt.
The company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost All financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs.
After initial recognition, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.
This category of financial liabilities includes payables and finance debt.

Pensions The primary pension arrangement is a funded final salary pension plan in the UK under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four company-nominated directors, an independent director, and an independent chairman nominated by the company.
The plan is closed to new joiners but remains open to ongoing accrual for current members.
New joiners are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.
During 2016 the aggregate level of contributions was $539 million 2015 $754 million.
The aggregate level of contributions in 2017 is expected to be approximately $652 million, and includes contributions we expect to be required to make by law or under contractual agreements, as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.
For the primary plan there is a funding agreement between the company and the trustee.
The surplus relating to the primary pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any remaining assets once all members have left the plan.
The obligation and cost of providing the pension benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method.
The principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years in the UK.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the primary pension plan was as at 31 December 2014.
The material financial assumptions used to estimate the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below.
The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year, and are used to evaluate accrued pension benefits at 31 December and pension expense for the following year.

The inflation rate assumption is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest longterm government bonds.
The inflation assumption is used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in The parent company financial statements of BP p. l. c. on pages 215-238 do not form part of BPs Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.

For 2016, the assumed rate of increase for the UK plans also reflects the probability of exceeding a cap or breaching a floor for pension increases as set out in the plan rules: this change resulted in a reduction in the pension obligation of $865 million.
The assumption for the rate of increase in salaries is based on our inflation assumption plus an allowance for expected long-term real salary growth.
This includes allowance for promotion-related salary growth of 0.7%.
The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the UK, and have been chosen with regard to applicable published tables adjusted to reflect the experience of the plans and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
For the primary pension plan the mortality assumptions are as follows: Mortality assumptions Years 2016 2015 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60 28.0 28.5 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 30.0 31.0 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 29.5 29.5 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 31.9 31.9 The assets of the primary plan are held in a trust.
The primary objective of the trust is to accumulate pools of assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plan.
A significant proportion of the assets are held in equities, owing to a higher expected level of return over the long term of such assets with an acceptable level of risk.
For the primary plan there is an agreement with the trustee to reduce the proportion of plan assets held as equities and increase the proportion held as bonds over time, with a view to better matching the asset portfolio with the pension liabilities.
During 2016, the plan switched 4% from equities to bonds.
The primary plan uses a liability driven investment LDI approach for part of the portfolio, a form of investing designed to match the movement in pension plan assets with the impact of interest rate changes and inflation assumption changes on the projected benefit obligation.
The companys asset allocation policy for the primary plan is as follows: Asset category % Total equity including private equity 58 Bonds cash including LDI 35 Property real estate 7 The amounts invested under the LDI programme as at 31 December 2016 were $423 million 2015 $329 million of government-issued nominal bonds and $9,384 million 2015 $6,421 million of index-linked bonds.
In addition, the primary plan has entered into interest rate swaps in the year to offset the long-term fixed interest rate exposure for $4,450 million 2015 $2,651 million of the corporate bond portfolio.
The primary plan does not invest directly in either securities or property real estate of the company or of any subsidiary.

Pensions continued Sensitivity analysis The discount rate, inflation, salary growth and the mortality assumptions all have a significant effect on the amounts reported.
A one-percentage point change, in isolation, in certain assumptions as at 31 December 2016 for the companys plans would have had the effects shown in the table below.

One additional year of longevity in the mortality assumptions would increase the 2017 pension expense by $38 million and the pension obligation at 31 December 2016 by $1,092 million.
Estimated future benefit payments and the weighted average duration of defined benefit obligations The expected benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, but exclude plan expenses, up until 2026 and the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2016 are as follows: $ million Estimated future benefit payments 2017 904 2018 947 2019 984 2020 1,003 2021 1,039 2022-2026 5,576 Years Weighted average duration 20.4 5.
