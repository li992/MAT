Insurance contracts risk management continued Risk management objectives and policies for mitigating insurance risk continued Investment management Assets and liabilities are managed so as to effectively match the expected pattern of claims payments with the assets that are held to back outstanding claims liabilities.
The mix of investment between cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed to ensure that the Group has the ability to meet expected and unexpected requirements for cash.
Terms and conditions of insurance contracts The terms and conditions attached to insurance contracts affect the level of insurance risk accepted.
Insurance contracts written are entered into on a standard form basis.
Insurance contracts are entered into on an annual basis and at the time of entering into a contract certain terms and conditions are negotiable or, in the case of renewals, renegotiable.
There are noembedded derivatives that are separately recognised from a host insurance contract.
Concentrations of insurance risk The exposure to concentrations of insurance risk is mitigated by a portfolio which is diversified across many different individual customers living in different parts of the UK.
Therefore, the Directors do not believe there are significant concentrations of insurance risk.
