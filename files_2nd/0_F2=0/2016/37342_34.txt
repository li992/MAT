EPRA adjusted earnings and EPRA adjusted earnings per share include the amortisation of bond exchange fide-recognition of 23.4m and head office relocation costs of 5.6m.
EPRA adjusted net assets and adjusted diluted net assets per share include the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment of 368.3m.
Our NIY and Topped-up NIY relate to the Combined Portfolio, excluding properties in the development programme that have not yet reached practical completion, and are calculated by our external valuers.
EPRA NIY and EPRA Topped-up NIY calculations are consistent with ours, but excludes all developments.
Our measure reflects voids in our like-for-like portfolio only.
The EPRA measure reflects voids in the Combined Portfolio excluding only the development programme.
The EPRA cost ratio is calculated based on gross rental income after rents payable, whereas our measure is based on gross rental income before rents payable.
We do not calculate a cost ratio excluding direct vacancy costs as we do not consider this to be helpful.
