153 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Basis of preparation a Accounting basis The consolidated financial statements of Aldermore Group PLC the Company and its subsidiary undertakings together, the Group include its principal subsidiary, Aldermore Bank PLC the Bank.
Both the Group consolidated financial statements and the Company financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and as adopted by the European Union EU.
For IAS 39: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement the exclusion regarding hedge accounting the so called carve out decreed by the EU on 19 November 2014 is taken into account.
By including the Company financial statements here together with the Group consolidated financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
The principal activity of the Company is that of an investment holding company.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which are entities controlled by the Company jointly referred to as the Group made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved when the Company: has power over the investee: is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and has the ability to use its power to affect returns.
If facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above, the Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Uniform accounting policies are applied consistently across the Group.
Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation.
Securitisation vehicles The Group has securitised certain loans and advances to customers by the transfer of the beneficial interest in such loans to securitisation vehicles see Note 22.
The securitisation enabled the subsequent issue of debt securities by a securitisation vehicle to investors who have the security of the underlying assets as collateral.
The securitisation vehicles are fully consolidated into the Groups accounts as the Group has control as defined above.
The transfer of the beneficial interest in these loans to the securitisation vehicle are not treated as sales by the Group.
The Group continues to recognise these assets within its own Statement of Financial Position after the transfer as it continues to retain substantially all the risks and rewards from the assets.
c Going concern The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors are satisfied that the Group has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future which has been taken as 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
In making this assessment, the Directors have considered a wide range of information relating to present and future conditions, including the current state of the statement of financial position, future projections of profitability, cash flows and capital resources and the longer-term strategy of the business.
The Groups capital and liquidity plans, including stress tests, have been reviewed by the Directors.
The Groups forecasts and projections, including a range of stressed scenarios, show that it will be able to operate with adequate levels of both liquidity and capital for the foreseeable future.
After making due enquiries, the Directors believe that the Group has sufficient resources to continue its activities for the foreseeable future and to continue its planned expansion.
Additionally, the Group has sufficient capital to enable it to continue to meet its regulatory capital requirements as set out by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA.
154 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation continued d Basis of measurement The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following material items in the financial statements: derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss: certain debt securities which are designated at fair value through profit or loss: available for sale debt securities are valued at fair value through other comprehensive income: and fair value adjustments for portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities designated as hedged items in qualifying fair value hedge relationships, which reflect changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.
e Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
"Information about areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are included in Note 3. f Presentation of risk and capital disclosures The disclosures required under IFRS 7: Financial instruments: disclosures and IAS 1: ""Presentation of financial statements"" have been included within the audited sections of the Risk Report on page 106."
Where information is marked as audited, it is incorporated into these financial statements by this cross reference and it is covered by the Independent Auditors report on page 142. g Future accounting developments All standards or amendments to existing standards which have been endorsed by the EU and which are available for early adoption for annual periods commencing on or after 1 January 2016 have been adopted by the Group apart from IFRS 9: Financial Instruments and IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers.
There are also a number of standards, amendments and interpretations which have been issued by the IASB but which have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
The most significant of these is IFRS 16: Leases the planned replacement for IAS 17: Leases.
IFRS 9: Financial Instruments is the comprehensive standard to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and was endorsed by the EU on 22 November 2016.
IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and is required to be applied retrospectively.
However, prior periods need not be restated, instead an adjustment may be reflected in opening retained earnings at the start of the period when IFRS 9 is first adopted.
The standard includes requirements for classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities, hedge accounting and the impairment of financial assets.
Classification and measurement The classification of financial assets will be based on the objectives of the Groups business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instruments.
Financial assets will then be classified as held at amortised cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI, or at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL.
In most instances, the measurement outcomes will be similar to those under IAS 39 and therefore, any changes from the accounting treatment currently followed by the Group under IAS 39 are not expected to be significant.
The classification of financial liabilities is essentially unchanged from the treatment under IAS 39.
155 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Impairment of financial assets Impairment provisions in all financial assets are recognised based on either 12 month expected losses or lifetime expected losses.
This will result in the acceleration of the recognition of impairment provisions and will lead to more volatile impairment charges in the income statement.
However, whilst IFRS9 represents a significant change compared to IAS 39, the quantum of impairment losses recorded against any one loan over the life of the loan will not change as IFRS 9 alters only the timing of recognition of impairment losses.
IFRS 9 introduces a number of changes to approach as compared to the current methodology under IAS 39.
The main changes are: Expected credit losses ECL are based on an assessment of the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default discounted to give a net present value.
The estimation of ECL should be unbiased and probability weighted to reflect a range of possible outcomes taking into account all reasonable and supportable information including forward-looking economic assumptions.
On initial recognition, and for financial assets where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since the date of origination, IFRS 9 provisions will be made to reflect ECL arising from expected credit default events within the next 12 months.
A key requirement of IFRS 9, compared with the existing impairment approach under IAS 39, relates to assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the date of origination.
Provisions will be made for those assets expected to default at any point over their lifetime, reflecting the assets full expected loss.
For assets where there is evidence of credit impairment, provisions will be made under IFRS 9 for lifetime expected credit losses, taking account of forward looking economic assumptions and a range of possible outcomes.
Under IAS 39, provisions are currently based on the assets carrying value and the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
It is not anticipated that changes in the approach to impairment will have a significant impact on the Groups provisions in respect of specifically impaired loans, as the current provisions on such loans are based on estimates of lifetime expected losses arising based on expected future cash flows, but excluding any future credit losses that have not yet been incurred.
In respect of other loans, against which collective provisions are raised, our current approach, as explained in Note 3 a, is to estimate probabilities of default for the next 12 months.
This approach is similar to that which will be required under IFRS 9 except, that in order to measure incurred losses, as required by IAS 39, management currently adjust the calculated 12 month expected loss, which is based on managements current best estimates, for an emergence period based on the nature of the underlying asset enabling management to reflect only the impairment considered to have been incurred at the reporting date.
Under IFRS 9, the estimated probabilities of default will need to be probability weighted, based on a range of possible economic scenarios.
While the Groups current approach to calculating collective impairment provisions as described above has similarities to the approach required under IFRS 9, it should be noted that IFRS 9 is a complex accounting standard and the Groups detailed credit modelling approach remains under development.
Hedge accounting The hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 are designed to create a stronger link with financial risk management.
At present, IFRS 9 does not address the portfolio hedging of interest rate risk currently undertaken by the Group.
Pending development of the IASBs proposals for dynamic risk management macro hedge accounting, to be considered in a separate accounting standard, IFRS 9 allows the option to continue to apply the existing hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39.
The Group plans to exercise the accounting policy choice to continue IAS 39 hedge accounting including the so called carve out as described in Note 2 j.
156 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation continued Implementation The Group has established an IFRS 9 programme.
The programme is jointly sponsored by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer.
The programme is cross-functional with representation from but not limited to Finance, Risk and IT.
Progress is regularly reported to the IFRS 9 Steering Group and the Audit Committee.
The key features of the programme include defining the IFRS 9 methodology and accounting policies, identifying data, reconciliation and system requirements, and the development and establishment of appropriate and compliant operating models within an appropriate governance framework.
Extensive work is being carried out with regards to technical analysis, the development of the credit models and the design of the required changes to systems, data, business processes, reporting and governance relating to impairment provisions.
During 2017, work will include building and testing of credit models and validating outputs, development of management information, implementation of business process changes and a parallel run phase.
The financial impact of IFRS 9 will be quantified once models and systems are further developed.
Impacts are expected to be disclosed no later than in the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2017.
The IASB has also issued IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers.
IFRS 15 provides a principles-based approach to recognise revenue and the concept of recognising revenue for obligations as they are satisfied.
The impact for the Group is currently being assessed but may impact our treatment of fees and commissions and other operating income, the majority of which relates to the Invoice Finance business.
The Standard was endorsed on 29 October 2016 and will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with retrospective application permitted.
On 13 January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16: Leases as a replacement for IAS 17: Leases.
The Standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with early application being permitted for companies that also apply IFRS 15.
The impact for the Group is currently being assessed.
A significant change will be the inclusion of a right of use asset within the statement of financial position in respect of the benefit the Group receives where it leases assets under operating leases, together with a financial liability in respect of the obligation to make operating lease payments.
Within the income statement, an operating charge will be reflected in respect of the use of the asset together with interest expense in relation to the financing, replacing the current operating lease charges included in administrative expenses.
Significant accounting policies a Interest income and expense Interest income and expense are recognised in the income statement on an effective interest rate EIR basis.
The EIR is the rate that, at the inception of the financial asset or liability, exactly discounts expected future cash payments and receipts over the expected life of the instrument back to the initial carrying amount.
When calculating the EIR, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the instrument for example, prepayment options but does not consider the assets future credit losses.
At each reporting date, management makes an assessment of the expected remaining life of its financial assets, including any acquired loan portfolios and where there is a change in those assessments, the remaining amount of any unamortised discount or premiums is adjusted so that the interest income continues to be recognised prospectively on the amortised cost of the financial asset at the original EIR.
The adjustment is recognised within interest income in the income statement for the current period.
The calculation of the EIR includes all transaction costs and fees paid or received that are an integral part of the interest rate, together with the discounts or premium arising on the acquisition of loan portfolios.
Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or liability.
157 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Interest income and expense presented in the income statement include: Interest on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost calculated on an EIR basis: Interest on available for sale debt securities calculated on an EIR basis: Interest income recognised on finance leases where the Group acts as the lessor see Note 2 o : The effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in fair value hedges of interest rate risk together with changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk: and Interest income on financial assets designated at fair value so as to avoid an accounting mismatch with derivatives held as an economic hedge and the matching interest component of the derivative.
Interest income includes amounts the Group charges its Invoice Finance clients as interest each day on the balance of their outstanding loans.
This interest income is recognised in the income statement on an EIR basis.
b Fee and commissions and other operating income i.
Fee and commission income Fee and commission income includes fees relating to services provided to customers which do not meet the criteria for inclusion within interest income.
Within the Invoice Finance segment of the Group, customers are charged a factoring fee for managing their sales ledgers.
This fee is recognised within fee and commissions income over the period in which the ledger management service is provided.
Other fee and commission income includes fees charged for mortgage services, arrears, and insurance commission receivable.
Fee income is recognised as the related services are performed.
Arrangement fees and other fees relating to loans and advances which do meet the criteria for inclusion within interest income are included as part of the EIR.
Fee and commission expense Fee and commission expense predominantly consists of introducer commissions, legal and valuation fees and company search fees.
Where these fee and commissions are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the issue of a financial instrument, they are included in interest income as part of the EIR calculation.
Where they are not incremental costs that are directly attributable, they are recognised within fee and commission expense as the services are received.
Other operating income Other operating income predominantly arises from the provision of invoice finance services and includes disbursements and collect out income.
This income is recognised within other operating income when the service is provided.
c Net income from derivatives and other financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss Net income from derivatives and other financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss relates to non-trading derivatives held for risk management purposes that do not form part of a qualifying hedging arrangement and financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss.
It includes all realised and unrealised fair value changes, interest and foreign exchange differences with the exception of interest income on financial assets designated at fair value and the matching interest component of the hedging derivatives.
The assets designated at fair value are treated in this manner so as to avoid an accounting mismatch with derivatives held as an economic hedge.
Recognition The Group initially recognises loans and advances, amounts due to banks, customer accounts and subordinated notes issued on the date that they are originated.
Regular way purchases and sales of debt securities and derivatives are recognised on the trade date at which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
All other financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Significant accounting policies continued ii.
Derecognition Financial assets are derecognised when there are qualifying transfers and: the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have ceased: or the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets.
When a financial asset is derecognised in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount, the sum of the consideration received including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement.
When available for sale financial assets are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss, including that previously recognised in reserves, is recognised in the income statement.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Any difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid is recognised through the income statement.
Funding for Lending Scheme FLS Loans and advances over which the Group transfers its rights to the collateral thereon to the Bank of England under the FLS are not derecognised from the statement of financial position as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership including all cash flows arising from the loans and advances and exposure to credit risk.
The treasury bills that the Group borrows against the transferred assets are not recognised in the statement of financial position but, where they are sold to third parties by the Group under agreements to repurchase, the cash received is recognised as an asset within the statement of financial position together with the corresponding obligation to return it which is recognised as a liability at amortised cost within Amounts due to banks.
Interest is accrued over the life of the agreement on an EIR basis.
Term Funding Scheme TFS Loans and advances over which the Group transfers its rights to the collateral thereon to the Bank of England under the TFS are not derecognised from the statement of financial position as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership including all cash flows arising from the loans and advances and exposure to credit risk.
The cash received against the transferred assets is recognised as an asset within the statement of financial position, together with the corresponding obligation to return it, which is recognised as a liability at amortised cost within Amounts due to banks.
e Financial assets i. Overview The Group classifies its financial assets excluding derivatives as either: loans and receivables: available for sale: or financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and that the Group does not intend to sell immediately or in the near term.
These are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the financial asset.
Subsequently, these are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method.
The amortised cost is the amount advanced less principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the EIR method of any difference between the amount advanced and the maturity amount, less impairment provisions for incurred losses.
Loans and receivables mainly comprise loans and advances to banks and customers.
159 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices iii.
Available for sale Available for sale financial assets are debt securities that are not held for trading and are intended to be held for an indefinite period of time.
Subsequently, they are measured at fair value based on current quoted bid prices in active markets for identical assets that the Group can access at the reporting date.
Where there is no active market, or the debt securities are unlisted, the fair values are based on valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, with reference to relevant market rates, and other commonly used valuation techniques.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement using the EIR method.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Other fair value changes are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the available for sale reserve in equity.
On disposal, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is reclassified to the income statement.
Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss are assets which have been designated as such to eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement and recognition inconsistency or where management specifically manages an asset or liability on that basis.
These assets are measured at fair value based on current quoted bid prices in active markets for identical assets that the Group can access at the reporting date.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value are brought into the income statement within Net income expense from derivatives and other financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss as they arise.
The Group disposed of all of its financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss during 2015. f Financial liabilities i. Overview Financial liabilities are contractual obligations to deliver cash or another financial asset.
Financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs for financial liabilities other than derivatives.
Financial liabilities, other than derivatives, are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities at amortised cost Financial liabilities at amortised cost are recognised initially at fair value, which equates to issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred.
They are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the EIR method.
Subordinated notes Subordinated notes issued by the Group are assessed as to whether they should be treated as equity or financial liabilities.
Where there is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets, they are treated as a financial liability and measured at amortised cost using the EIR method after taking account of any discount or premium on the issue and directly attributable costs that are an integral part of the EIR.
The amount of any discount or premium is amortised over the period to the expected call date of the instrument.
All subordinated notes issued by the Group are classified as financial liabilities.
Assessment At each reporting date, the Group assesses its financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss as to whether there is objective evidence that the assets are impaired.
Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired may include: significant financial difficulty of the borrower: a breach of contract such as default or delinquency in interest or principal repayments: the granting of a concession for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrowers financial condition that the Group would not otherwise grant: indications that a borrower or issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation: the disappearance of an active market for a debt security because of the issuers financial difficulties: or 160 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant accounting policies continued national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults within groups of financial assets e. g. increases in unemployment rates or decreases in property prices relating to the collateral held.
The Group considers evidence for the impairment of loans and advances at both the individual asset and collective level.
In certain cases, where a borrower is experiencing significant financial distress, the Group may use forbearance measures to assist them and mitigate against default.
Any forbearance measures agreed are assessed on a case by case basis.
Scope The Group considers evidence of impairment of financial assets at both an individual asset and collective level.
Individual impairment All individually significant financial assets are assessed for individual impairment using a range of risk criteria.
Those found not to be individually impaired are then collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet identified.
Assets may be considered to be individually impaired where they meet one or more of the following criteria: a default position equivalent to three or more missed monthly repayments or a quarterly payment which is more than 30 days past due : litigation proceedings have commenced: act of insolvency, e. g. bankruptcy, administration or liquidation, or appointment of an LPA Receiver: invoice finance accounts are classified as in default when there is cessation of additional advances and or when the facility is in collect out: or where there is evidence of fraud.
Collective impairment All financial assets that are not found to be individually impaired are collectively assessed for impairment by grouping together financial assets with similar risk characteristics.
Measurement Impairment provisions on financial assets individually identified as impaired are calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the assets original EIR.
When assessing collective impairment, the Group estimates incurred losses using a statistical model which multiplies the probability of default PD for each class of customer using external credit rating information by the loss given default LGD multiplied by the estimated exposure at default EaD to arrive at the projected expected loss.
An emergence period is subsequently applied to the projected expected loss to determine the estimated level of incurred losses at each reporting date.
In addition, an adjustment is made to discount the imputed cash flows from the model at the assets original EIR to arrive at the recorded collective provisions.
The models results are adjusted for managements judgement as to whether current economic and credit conditions are such that actual losses are likely to differ from those suggested by historical modelling.
In assessing the level of collective impairment provisions, the Group uses statistical modelling of historical trends of probability of default, the timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred, adjusted for managements judgement as to whether current economic and credit conditions are such that actual losses are likely to be greater or less than suggested by historical trends.
Default rates, loss rates and the expected timing of future recoveries are benchmarked against actual outcomes to ensure they remain appropriate.
Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement and a corresponding reduction in the value of the financial asset is recognised through the use of an allowance account.
161 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices A write-off is made when all or part of a financial asset is deemed uncollectable or forgiven after all collection procedures have been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined.
Write-offs are charged against amounts previously reflected in the allowance account or directly to the income statement.
Any additional amounts recovered after a financial asset has been previously written-off are offset against the write-off charge in the income statement.
Allowances for impairment losses are released at the point when it is deemed that, following a subsequent event, the risk has reduced such that an allowance is no longer required.
Interest on impaired financial assets is recognised at the same EIR as applied at the initial recognition of the financial asset but applied to the book value of the financial asset net of any individual impairment allowance that has been raised.
Impairment of financial assets classified as available for sale Impairment losses on available for sale debt securities are recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in the available for sale reserve in equity to the income statement.
The cumulative loss that is reclassified from equity to the income statement is the difference between the acquisition cost, net of any principal repayment and amortisation, and the current fair value less any impairment loss recognised previously in the income statement.
Changes in impairment provisions attributable to the effective interest method are reflected as a component of interest income.
If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of an impaired available for sale debt security increases and the increase can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, then the impairment loss is reversed.
h Financial instrumentsfair value measurement Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal market, or in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date.
The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.
Where applicable, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument.
A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing on an ongoing basis.
Where there is no quoted price in an active market, the Group uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimises the use of unobservable inputs.
The chosen valuation techniques incorporate factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction.
The best evidence of fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the transaction price.
If an asset measured at fair value has a bid and an offer price, the Group measures assets and long positions at the bid price and liabilities at the offer price.
i Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative transactions only for the purpose of reducing exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates and market indices: they are not used for proprietary trading purposes.
Derivatives are carried at fair value with movements in fair values recorded in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments are principally valued by discounted cash flow models using yield curves that are based on observable market data or are based on valuations obtained from counterparties.
As the Groups derivatives are covered by master netting agreements with the Groups counterparties, with any net exposures then being further covered by the payment or receipt of periodic cash margins, the Group has used a risk-free discount rate for the determination of their fair values.
All derivatives are classified as assets where their fair value is positive and liabilities where their fair value is negative.
Where there is the current legal ability and intention to settle net, then the derivative is classified as a net asset or liability, as appropriate.
Where cash collateral is received, to mitigate the risk inherent in amounts due to the Group, it is included as a liability within Amounts due to banks.
Where cash collateral is given, to mitigate the risk inherent in amounts due from the Group, it is included as an asset in Loans and advances to banks.
162 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant accounting policies continued j Hedge accounting The Group designates certain derivatives held for risk management as hedging instruments in qualifying hedging relationships.
On initial designation of the hedge, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items, including the risk management objective, the strategy in undertaking the hedge and the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship.
The Group makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as on an ongoing basis as to whether the hedging instruments are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value of the respective hedged items during the period for which the hedge is designated.
Fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk The Group applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk.
As part of its risk management process, the Group identifies portfolios whose interest rate risk it wishes to hedge.
The portfolios comprise either only assets or only liabilities.
The Group analyses each portfolio into repricing time periods based on expected repricing dates, by scheduling cash flows into the periods in which they are expected to occur.
Using this analysis, the Group designates as the hedged item an amount of the assets or liabilities from each portfolio that it wishes to hedge.
The Group measures monthly the change in fair value of the portfolio relating to the interest rate risk that is being hedged.
Provided that the hedge has been highly effective, the Group recognises the change in fair value of each hedged item in the income statement with the cumulative movement in their value being shown on the statement of financial position as a separate item, Fair value adjustment for portfolio hedged risk, either within assets or liabilities as appropriate.
This amount is amortised on a straight line basis to the income statement over the remaining average life of the original hedge relationship from the month in which it is first recognised.
The Group measures the fair value of each hedging instrument monthly.
The value is included in derivative financial instruments in either assets or liabilities as appropriate, with the change in value recorded in the income statement.
Any hedge ineffectiveness is recognised in the income statement as the difference between the change in fair value of the hedged item and the change in fair value of the hedging instrument.
k Embedded derivatives A derivative may be embedded in another instrument, known as the host contract.
Where the economic characteristics and risks of an embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value through profit or loss, the embedded derivative is separated from the host and held on the statement of financial position with Derivatives held for risk management at fair value.
Movements in fair value are recognised in the income statement, whilst the host contract is accounted for according to the relevant accounting policy for that particular asset or liability.
Embedded derivatives contained within equity instruments are considered separately.
The embedded derivative on the contingent convertible securities is not separated as the Group has an accounting policy not to separate a feature that has already been considered in determining that the entire issue is a non-derivative equity instrument.
l Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, or deemed cost on transition to IFRSs, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset or costs incurred in bringing the asset in to use.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset to realisable values on a straight line basis over its expected useful life, as follows: Fixtures, fittings and equipment five years Computer hardware one to five years Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.
163 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices m Intangible assets i.
Goodwill Goodwill is stated at deemed cost upon transition to IFRSs less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment on an annual basis.
Where impairment is required, the amount is recognised in the income statement and cannot be subsequently reversed.
Computer systems Software acquired by the Group is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Expenditure on internally developed software is recognised as an asset when the Group is able to demonstrate its intention and ability to complete the development and use the software in a manner that will generate future economic benefits and can reliably measure the costs to complete the development.
The capitalised costs of internally developed software include all costs directly attributable to developing the software and are amortised over its useful life.
Internally developed software is stated at capitalised cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Software is amortised on a straight line basis in the income statement over its useful life from the date that it is available for use.
The estimated useful life of software is one to five years.
n Impairment of non financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, i. e. goodwill and other intangible assets, are reviewed at least annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to operating segments.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of a segment is less than its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of a segment is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
Value in use is calculated from forecasts by management of post-tax profits for the subsequent five years and a residual value discounted at a risk adjusted interest rate appropriate to the cash generating unit.
Fair value is determined through review of precedent transactions for comparable businesses.
Other intangible assets If impairment is indicated, the assets recoverable amount, being the greater of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, is estimated.
Value in use is calculated by discounting the future cash flows from continuing use of the asset.
If the carrying value of the asset is less than the greater of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
o Assets leased to customers Leases of assets to customers are finance leases as defined by IAS 17.
When assets are leased to customers under finance leases, the present value of the lease payments is recognised as a receivable.
The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance income.
Lease income is recognised within interest income in the income statement over the term of the lease using the net investment method before tax which reflects a constant periodic rate of return ignoring tax cash flows.
p Assets leased from third parties Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged to the income statement, within administrative expenses or staff costs in the case of company cars, on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
The Group holds no assets under finance leases.

Significant accounting policies continued q Provisions A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
The Group has an obligation to contribute to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS to enable the FSCS to meet compensation claims from, in particular, retail depositors of failed banks.
A provision is recognised to the extent it can be reliably estimated and from the point when the Group has an obligation in accordance with IAS 37.
The amount provided is based on information received from the FSCS, forecast future interest rates and the Groups historic share of industry protected deposits.
The FSCS provision is recognised at the commencement of the scheme year in line with IFRIC 21. r Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities held at the statement of financial position date are translated into sterling using the exchange rates ruling at the statement of financial position date.
Exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement.
s Taxation Taxation comprises current and deferred tax, and is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is not recognised for: temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the Group expects at the end of the reporting period to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
t Pension costs The cost of providing retirement benefits is charged to the income statement at the amount of the defined contributions payable for each year.
Differences between contributions payable and those actually paid are shown as accruals or prepayments.
The Group has no defined benefit pension scheme.
Capital instruments The Company classifies capital instruments as financial liabilities or equity instruments in accordance with the substance of the contractual terms of the instruments.
Where an instrument contains no obligation on the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets, or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group, or where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments but includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments, then it is treated as an equity instrument.
Accordingly, the Companys share capital and contingent convertible securities are presented as components of equity.
165 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Any dividends, interest or other distributions on capital instruments are also recognised in equity.
Any related tax is accounted for in accordance with IAS 12. ii.
Share premium Share premium is the amount by which the fair value of the consideration received exceeds the nominal value of the shares issued.
v Capital raising costs Costs directly incremental to the raising of share capital are netted against the share premium account.
Costs directly incremental to the raising of convertible securities included in equity are offset against the proceeds from the issue within equity.
w Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and balances with a maturity of three months or less from the acquisition date which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
x Investment in group undertakings Investments in group undertakings are initially recognised at cost.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made as to whether there is any indication that the investment may be impaired such that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value.
y Warrants The Companys subsidiary, Aldermore Bank PLC, previously issued subordinated notes with attached warrants.
The warrants gave the holders the right to subscribe for shares in the Company.
These warrants were exercised during 2015 resulting in an increase in share capital and share premium.
On exercise, the warrant reserve was re-classified to retained earnings.
z Share-based payment transactions Employees including Senior Executives of the Group may receive remuneration in the form of equity settled share-based payments to incentivise and reward future strong, long-term business performance and growth.
The grant date fair value is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The grant date fair value is determined using valuation models which take into account the terms and conditions attached to the awards.
Inputs into valuation models may include the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the Companys share price and other factors related to performance conditions attached to the awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect differences between expected and actual outcomes, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
For share-based payment awards with market performance conditions or nonvesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
Within the Parent Company standalone financial statements, the share-based payment transactions are recognised as an investment in Group undertakings with an associated credit to the share-based payment reserve.
Employee Benefit Trust EBT An EBT purchased shares in the Company for the sole purpose of satisfying awards under employee share plans.
These shares continue to be held within the acquiring EBT, which is consolidated in these financial statements as the EBT is deemed to be controlled by the Group.
Where an Employee Benefit Trust EBT purchases the Companys share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from shareholders equity as own shares until they are cancelled.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders equity.
166 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of financial information requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The judgements and assumptions that are considered to be the most important to the portrayal of the Groups financial condition are those relating to loan impairment provisions, EIR, and Invoice Finance goodwill.
a Loan impairment provisions Loan portfolios across all segments of the Group are reviewed on at least a monthly basis to assess for impairment.
In determining whether an impairment provision should be recorded, judgements are made as to whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or portfolio of financial assets is impaired as a result of loss events that occurred after recognition of the asset and by the reporting date.
The calculation of impairment loss is managements best estimate of losses incurred in the portfolio at the statement of financial position date and reflects expected future cash flows based on both the likelihood of a loan or advance being written-off and the estimated loss on such a write-off.
At 31 December 2016, gross loans and advances to customers totalled 7,504.7 million 31 December 2015: 6,165.5 million against which impairment allowances of 27.4 million 31 December 2015: 20.7 million had been made see Note 22.
The Groups accounting policy for loan impairment provisions on financial assets classified as loans and receivables is described in Note 2 g. Impairment allowances are made up of two components, those determined individually against specific assets and those determined collectively.
Of the impairment allowance of 27.4 million at 31 December 2016, 14.3 million 31 December 2015: 10.2 million relates to individual provisions and 13.1 million 31 December 2015: 10.5 million relates to collective provisions.
The section below provides details of the critical elements of judgement within the loan impairment calculations.
Less significant judgements are not disclosed.
Individual Individual impairment allowances are established against the Groups individual financial assets that are deemed by management to be impaired.
The determination of individual impairment allowances requires the exercise of considerable judgement by management involving matters such as local economic conditions, the financial status of the customer and the realisable value of the security held.
The actual amount of the future cash flows and their timing may differ significantly from the assumptions made for the purposes of determining the impairment allowances and consequently these allowances can be subject to variation as time progresses and the circumstances of the customer become clearer.
Collective The collective impairment allowance is also subject to estimation uncertainty and, in particular, is sensitive to changes in economic and credit conditions, including house prices, unemployment rates, interest rates, borrowers behaviour and consumer bankruptcy trends.
All of these factors can influence the key assumptions detailed below.
However, it is inherently difficult to estimate how changes in one or more of these factors might impact the collective impairment allowance.
The key assumptions used in the collective impairment model are: probability of default PD, the loss given default LGD and the loss emergence period EP the time between a trigger event occurring and the loans being identified as individually impaired.
An additional element is included within the collective provision to reflect fraud losses that are incurred as at the reporting date but are yet to be individually identified.
The Group uses two types of underlying models to calculate the LGD, depending on the availability of default data.
For SME Commercial Mortgages, Buy-to-Let and Residential Mortgages the models use a range of key assumptions to derive an expected LGD.
The key assumptions are based on management expertise and are validated against available data.
For Asset Finance and Invoice Finance, the models are empirical models which use historical loss data to determine the risk drivers behind the loss.
167 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices This allows the portfolios to be segmented into homogeneous buckets to derive an LGD.
Further details in respect of assumptions and details of the sensitivity of the estimate to changes in significant assumptions are as follows: Probability of default: The PD is based on external individual customer credit rating information updated for each reporting date.
This external credit rating information gives a PD in the next 12 months where default is defined as loans which are 2 months or more in arrears 2 MIA and incorporates credit information from a broad range of financial services products for each customer.
Management make an estimate so as to adjust the external data to reflect both the individual nature of the Groups lending and the Groups policy of classifying loans which are 3 months or more in arrears 3 MIA as impaired.
This adjustment is achieved by using two management assumptions: firstly a conversion rate that reflects how many of the loans which fall into 2 MIA will also fall into 3 MIA: and secondly a scalar that adjusts the external PDs to reflect the individual nature of the Groups lending.
absolute increase in the conversion rate assumed by management between 2 MIA and 3 MIA e. g. a PD increasing from 50 per cent to 60 per cent, when the loans are considered to be individually impaired would increase the impairment allowance by 0.5 million.
relative reduction in the scaling factors applied to external data in order to arise at PDs appropriate to the individual nature of lending being undertaken would increase the impairment allowance by 0.7 million.
Loss given default: The model calculates the LGD from the point of repossession of the asset.
Not all cases that are 3 MIA will reach repossession.
Management therefore adjust the model by applying an assumption of the percentage of accounts 3 MIA that will reach repossession.
absolute reduction in this assumption would decrease the impairment allowance by 0.5 million.
The LGD is also sensitive to the application of the House Price Index HPI and Forced Sale Discount FSD which affect the underlying value of the collateral which is expected to be received.
relative reduction in the HPI would increase the overall impairment allowance by 2.6 million.
absolute increase in the FSD would increase the overall impairment provision by 2.0 million.
The above assumptions are important factors when calculating the LGD to be applied for the Mortgage business.
For the Asset Finance and Invoice Finance model, the assumption with most judgment is the absolute LGD value calculated.
relative increase in the LGDs applied in Asset Finance and Invoice Finance would increase the overall impairment allowance by 0.9 million.
Emergence period: The Groups collective models estimate the expected losses for the next 12 months, these are then scaled back using the emergence period to reflect the level of incurred loss as at the reporting date.
The emergence period is the time taken from the trigger event such as a job loss to the Group identifying the loan as impaired.
The emergence period varies by segment and requires management to make judgements because of the limited data available.
During the year, management increased the emergence period applied to the Mortgage businesses by three months in order to apply a degree of caution to reflect the potential impact of political and economic uncertainty resulting from the EU referendum.
The impact of this change was to increase the collective provisions by 1.6 million.
A further three month increase in emergence periods for Asset Finance and Invoice Finance would increase the overall impairment allowance by 4.5 million.
168 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Use of estimates and judgements continued b Effective interest rate EIR IAS 39 requires interest earned from mortgages to be measured under the EIR method.
Management must therefore use judgement to estimate the expected life of each type of instrument and hence the expected related cash flows.
The accuracy of the EIR would therefore be affected by unexpected market movements resulting in altered customer behaviour and inaccuracies in the models used compared to actual outcomes.
A critical estimate in determining EIR is the expected life to maturity of the Groups SME Commercial, Buy-to-Let and Residential Mortgage portfolios, as a change in these estimates will impact the period over which the directly attributable costs and fees and any discount received on the acquisition of mortgage portfolios are recognised as part of the EIR.
Included within the overall Mortgages book, are a small number of portfolios which were acquired by the Group and, as at 31 December 2016, represent approximately 2 per cent, 2 per cent and 3 per cent of SME Commercial, Buy-to-Let and Residential Mortgages net loans respectively.
These portfolios were acquired at a discount which is being recognised under the EIR method.
As disclosed below, these portfolios, although representing a small proportion of overall lending, are sensitive to a change in the expected repayment profiles which would impact the periods over which the discount is to be unwound.
As at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, a reassessment was made of the estimates used in respect of the expected lives of the SME Commercial, Buy-to-Let and Residential Mortgage portfolios and also of those for the Asset Finance portfolios.
As a consequence, an overall adjustment of 0.5 million 2015: 0.4 million was recorded to increase the value of the loan portfolios and the interest income recognised in the current period, so that interest can continue to be recognised at the original effective interest rate over the remaining life of the relevant lending portfolios.
The adjustment made at 31 December is analysed as follows: Impact on 2016 Impact on 2015 interest income interest income m m Asset Finance - organic lending 1.8 1.6 SME Commercial - acquired portfolios 0.7 SME Commercial - organic lending 0.2 0.9 Buy-to-Let - acquired portfolios 1.1 0.6 Buy-to-Let - organic lending 0.1 0.1 Residential - acquired portfolios 0.4 1.1 Residential - organic lending 3.5 5.2 0.5 0.4 A change in the estimated expected lives, after taking account of the above adjustment, to extend the expected lives of the SME Commercial, Buy-to-Let and Residential Mortgage portfolios by six months would have the effect of reducing the cumulative profit before tax recognised as at 31 December 2016 by 1.4 million 31 December 2015: 1.5 million.
Included within this sensitivity of 1.4 million, is a 3.1 million cumulative reduction in profit relating to acquired portfolios 31 December 2015: 2.8 million due to a change in the unwind of the discount which is offset by a 1.7 million cumulative increase in profit relating to the organic portfolios 31 December 2015: 1.3 million.
increase in the rate of early redemptions, expressed as a percentage of the outstanding balance in respect of the Asset Finance portfolio would have the impact of reducing cumulative profit before tax recognised as at 31 December 2016 by 0.5 million 31 December 2015: 0.3 million.
c Share-based payments The fair value of the share awards is calculated using statistical models.
The inputs to these models require management judgement to estimate the probability and timings of events taking place in the future.
The significant inputs used in the models include the exercise price, share price, expected volatility, expected life and the risk free rate.
The share-based payment recognised can be materially affected by these assumptions.
Further information on the key assumptions can be found in Note 37.
169 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices d Invoice Finance goodwill IAS 36 requires an assessment of goodwill balances for impairment on at least an annual basis.
An impairment charge should be recognised where the recoverable amount from the segment is less than the carrying value of the goodwill.
During 2016, as a result of the general fall in market values of financial services businesses that occurred following the EU referendum, there was an indication of impairment and the Invoice Finance goodwill was fully impaired.
An impairment charge of 4.1 million has been recognised in the income statement.
Segmental information The Group has five reportable operating segments as described below which are based on the Groups five lending segments plus Central Functions.
Each segment offers groups of similar products and services and are managed separately based on the Groups internal reporting structure.
SME Commercial Mortgages, Buy-to-Let and Residential Mortgages are operated under a single management team and supported by a single IT platform.
Shared administrative expenses in the mortgage business have been apportioned across these segments on the basis of business activity levels in each segment.
However, the characteristics of the three segments are sufficiently different, are reported separately to the Board and therefore, they represent separate operating segments in accordance with IFRS 8.
For each of the reportable segments, the Board, which is the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker, reviews internal management reports on a monthly basis.
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Groups reportable segments: Asset Finance - Lease and hire purchase financing for SMEs, focusing on sectors with strong returns and liquid secondary asset markets: Invoice Finance - provides UK SMEs with working capital solutions through invoice discounting, factoring and asset based lending: SME Commercial Mortgages - Property finance needs of professional, commercial property investors, and owner-occupier SMEs.
Targets prime and specialist prime segments with loan sizes generally below 5 million: Buy-to-Let - Offers a wide range of standard and specialist buy-to-let mortgages for residential units, multi-unit freehold or houses with multiple-occupation HMO to both individuals and companies: and Residential Mortgages - Prime residential mortgages targeting underserved segments of creditworthy borrowers that provide attractive and sustainable margins.
Central Functions includes the reconciling items between the total of the five reportable operating segments and the consolidated income statement.
As well as common costs, Central Functions includes the Groups Treasury and Savings functions which are responsible for raising finance on behalf of the operating segments.
The costs of raising finance are all recharged by Central Functions to the operating segments, apart from those costs relating to the subordinated notes and the net expense income from derivatives held at fair value shown in Note 6.
Common costs are incurred on behalf of the operating segments and typically represent savings administration, back office and support function costs such as Finance, Risk and Human Resources.
The costs are not directly attributable to the operating segments.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment and their reconciliation to the total results of the Group is shown below.
Performance is measured based on the segmental result as included in the internal management reports.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Groups operating segments with the aggregate amount allocated to each segment as follows: 2016 2015 m m SME Commercial Mortgages 8.5 8.5 Invoice Finance 4.1 8.5 12.6 At 1 January 2016, the Invoice Finance goodwill was fully supported using the Fair Value less Costs of Disposal FVLCD method.
During 2016, as a result of the general fall in market values of financial services businesses following the EU referendum, management concluded the goodwill balance was fully impaired and a charge of 4.1 million has been recognised in the income statement.
The Value in Use VIU for SME Commercial Mortgages was determined by discounting the future cash flows to be generated from the continuing use of the segment.
VIU at 31 December 2016 has been determined in a similar manner as at 31 December 2015.
183 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Key assumptions used in the calculation of VIU were the following: Cash flows were projected based on past experience, actual operating results and the five year business plan 31 December 2015: the five year business plan.
Cash flows after the planning period were extrapolated using a constant growth rate of 2 per cent 31 December 2015: 2 per cent into perpetuity.
A pre-tax discount rate of 13.0 per cent 31 December 2015: 13.0 per cent was applied in determining the recoverable amounts for the SME Commercial Mortgages operating segment.
These discount rates were based on the weighted average cost of funding for the segment, taking into account the Groups regulatory capital requirement and expected market returns for debt and equity funding, then adjusted for risk premiums to reflect the systemic risk of the segment.
IAS 36 requires an assessment of goodwill balances for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment.
Under IAS 36, the recoverable amount is the greater of either the VIU of a business or its Fair Value less Costs of Disposal FVLCD.
The VIU of the SME Commercial Mortgages segment is significantly above the carrying value of the attributable goodwill and net assets.
The Group estimates that reasonably possible changes in the above assumptions are not expected to cause the recoverable amount of SME Commercial Mortgages to reduce below the carrying amount.

185 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Customer redress The Group has a small number of loans which are regulated under the Consumer Credit Act CCA and had identified that, following changes to the CCA in 2008, certain letters and statements were sent to customers that did not fully comply with the requirements prescribed by the CCA.

187 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices The terms of the schemes are as follows: a Performance Share Plan The Performance Share Plan PSP is open to senior employees including the Executive team.
There are currently awards outstanding for two plan years as per the table above.
Individuals are required to remain in employment for three years following the grant date and the awards are subject to a two-year holding period following the required employment date.
Awards under the PSP are subject to performance conditions which are set by the Remuneration Committee and determine the extent to which awards can become available to individuals.
Performance conditions for the PSP awards relate to the growth in Total Shareholder Return TSR for 50% of each award and Earnings Per Share EPS performance for the remaining 50% of each award.
The outcome of the performance conditions, as assessed by the Remuneration Committee, will determine the vesting outcome of the awards and the shares available for exercise.
In addition, there are underpin performance conditions which must be met in relation to both elements of the award and the result achieved must both appropriately reflect the performance of the Company and be consistent with the Companys risk appetite.
Furthermore, in respect of the TSR element of the grant made in 2015, the value of the TSR achieved over the performance period must be equal to or greater than the TSR of the median company of FTSE 350 companies, excluding Investment Trusts and the Company itself.
b Pre-IPO Award under the Performance Share Plan Pre-IPO Awards in respect of 6,920,420 shares, which were granted on 2 March 2015 to individuals as a one-off reward to recognise their contribution up to the Companys IPO, have lapsed as the principal performance condition relating to growth in TSR for the period to 31 December 2016 was not satisfied.
c Top Up Pre-IPO awards under the Performance Share Plan For the small number of employees who had been granted a Top Up Pre-IPO Award at the time of IPO which was intended to promote their retention and to reward them for their performance both pre-IPO and post-IPO, the Remuneration Committee amended the Top Up portion of those awards over 513,589 shares such that: The principal performance condition was a personal performance condition, as well as an underpin whereby the Remuneration Committee would determine that the performance of the Company justified the vesting.
The Remuneration Committee determined that the amended performance condition and underpin had been met as at 31 December 2016.
The awards normally become exercisable on 31 December 2018 and are contingent on employment to this date, with a leaver receiving a pro-rated proportion of the shares for the period 31 December 2016 to 31 December 2018 except if the individual ceases employment because of misconduct in which case the whole award would lapse.
The total incremental fair value arising from the modification of the awards is 1,188,000 of which 16,000 has been reflected in the 2016 income statement charge.
The fair value of the awards has been determined using the market price of Aldermore Group PLC shares as at 22 December 2016. d Restricted Share Plan The Restricted Share Plan RSP is open to a small number of senior employees engaged in risk and control functions.
There is a requirement for individuals to remain in employment for three years following the grant date, following which the awards are subject to a two-year holding period.
There are no financial performance conditions attached to the awards under the RSP.
e Recruitment Award The Recruitment Award was granted for the purpose of buying out awards forfeited by senior employees on resignation from their previous employment.
There are no performance conditions attached to this award.
The award will be released in tranches with twenty per cent vesting on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date and forty per cent on the fourth anniversary of the award, subject to continued employment.

Share-based payments continued f Share Incentive Plan All employees who were in employment on both 13 March 2015 and the grant date were eligible to participate in the Share Incentive Plan SIP.
An award of free shares was granted under the SIP on 17 April 2015.
Each eligible employee received shares worth 200, with an additional 200 for each year of service up to a maximum award of 1,000.
There are no performance conditions associated with the share awards.
Participants in the SIP are the beneficial owners of the shares granted to them, but not the registered owner.
Voting rights are normally exercised by the registered owner at the direction of the participant.
g Sharesave Plan All employees are eligible to participate in the Groups annual invitation to join the Sharesave Plan.
The grant dates of the awards are shown in the table above, with individuals in the Plan contributing a set amount each month for three years.
At the end of the savings period, participants have the option to buy shares in Aldermore Group PLC at an option price which was fixed at the grant date.
There are no financial performance conditions attached to the awards but employees may only continue to participate in the Plan whilst in the employment of the Group, and subject to having made all monthly contributions.
Participants have the option, but not the obligation, to buy shares at the end of the plan.
There are no holding conditions in respect of shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an option.
h Deferred Share Plan The Deferred Share Plan DSP is open to senior employees, including the Executive team, and represents the portion of awards under the Annual Incentive Plan that is deferred to align the interests of senior employees and the Executive team with shareholders.
The awards typically vest in tranches of one-third on the first, second and third anniversary of the award date, subject to continued employment.
There are no market performance conditions attached to the awards made under the DSP.
Share awards, representing the deferred element of the 2015 bonus payments, with a grant date fair value of 1.2 million, were granted in March 2016.
There is an anticipation that share awards for the deferred element of the 2016 bonuses, with a grant date fair value of 1.6 million, will be made in 2017.

This is designed to deliver a benefit similar to that which ordinary shareholders may receive in respect of any dividends paid during the vesting period.
Accordingly, the grant date fair value of the awards with no performance conditions other than service conditions has been taken as the market value of the Companys ordinary shares at the grant date.
In respect of awards for which there are non-market performance conditions e. g. EPS, the grant date fair value per award has been taken as the market value of an ordinary share at the grant date.
A forecast is made of the number of awards expected to vest in order to determine the overall share-based payment charge to be recognised over the vesting period.
In respect of awards for which there are market performance conditions e. g. TSR, the grant date fair value of each award is required to reflect the likelihood of achieving the market conditions within the valuation.
For the awards concerned, the grant date fair values for each award were determined using stochastic simulation models with the following significant inputs: PSP Ordinary share price 2.29 Risk-free rate 0.50% p. a. Probability distributions of TSRs for Aldermore and the median FTSE 350 excluding Investment Trust companies Log normal 1 Annual volatility of logarithm of TSR for Aldermore share price based on recently floated banks 40% Annual volatility of logarithm of TSR for median of FTSE 350 excluding Investment Trust companies based on five years data 29% Correlation between volatilities None 1 Based on Aldermore Group PLC share price volatility annualised, from date of listing 13 March 2015 to the grant date 21 March 2016.

Contingent convertible securities 2016 2015 m m Contingent convertible securities 74.0 74.0 On 9 December 2014, the Company issued 75 million Fixed Rate Reset Additional Tier 1 Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securities the Securities.
Net proceeds arising from the issuance, after deducting issuance costs and the associated tax credit, totalled 74.0 million.
The Securities are perpetual and have no fixed redemption date.
Redemption of the Securities is at the option of the Company on 30 April 2020 and annually thereafter.
The Securities bear interest at an initial rate of 11.875 per cent per annum until 30 April 2020 and thereafter at the relevant Reset Interest Rate as provided in the Information Memorandum.
Interest is payable on the Securities annually in arrears on each interest payment date commencing 30 April 2015 and is non-cumulative.
The Borrower has the full discretion to cancel any interest scheduled to be paid on the Securities.
The Securities are convertible into Ordinary Shares of the Company in the event of the Groups Common equity ratio falling below 7 per cent.
As the Securities contain no obligation on the Company to make payments of principal or interest, they have been classified as equity instruments as required by IAS 32.
Accordingly, the Securities have been included in equity at the fair value of the proceeds received less any direct costs attributable to the issue of the Securities, net of tax relief thereon.
Any interest paid on the Securities, net of tax relief thereon, is a distribution to holders of equity instruments and has been recognised directly in equity on the payment date.
Although there are number of additional terms relating to events such as acquisition and wind up, there are no circumstances in which the Group has an unavoidable obligation to issue a variable number of its own shares.
The Group has not separated any embedded derivative features because the Group has an accounting policy not to separate a feature that has already been considered in determining that the entire issue is a non-derivative equity instrument.

The fair values in this note are stated at a specific date and may be significantly different from the amounts which will actually be paid on the maturity or settlement dates of the instruments.
As a wide range of valuation techniques are available, it may be inappropriate to compare this fair value information to that of independent market or other financial institutions.

b Loans and advances to banks These represent either amounts with an initial maturity of less than three months or longer term variable rate deposits placed with banks, where adjustments to fair value in respect of the credit risk of the counterparty are not considered necessary.
Accordingly, the carrying value of the assets is considered to be not materially different from their fair value.
c Loans and advances to customers For fixed rate lending products, the Group has estimated the fair value of the fixed rate interest cash flows by discounting those cash flows by the current appropriate market reference rate used for pricing equivalent products plus the credit spread attributable to the borrower.
For standard variable rate lending products, and fixed rate products when they revert to the Groups standard variable rate, the interest rate on such products is considered equivalent to a current market product rate and, as such, the Group considers the discounted future cash flows of these mortgages to be equal to their carrying value.
The fair value estimations do not incorporate adjustments for changes in future credit risk, since loans were granted.
However, incurred loss provisions are deducted from the fair value amounts.
d Other assets and liabilities These represent short term receivables and payables and, as such, their carrying value is not considered to be materially different from their fair value.
e Amounts due to banks These mainly represent securities sold under agreements to repurchase which were drawn down from the Bank of England under the terms of the Funding for Lending and Term Funding Schemes.
These transactions are collateralised by UK Government Treasury Bills, which have a low susceptibility to credit risk, so adjustments to fair value in respect of the credit risk of the counterparty are not considered necessary.
Accordingly, the carrying value of the liabilities are not considered to be materially different from their fair value.
196 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 42.
Financial instruments and fair value continued f Customers accounts The fair value of fixed rate customers accounts have been determined by discounting estimated future cash flows based on rates currently offered by the Group for equivalent deposits.
Customers accounts at variable rates are at current market rates and therefore, the Group regards the fair value to be equal to the carrying value.
The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand.
g Debt securities in issue As the securities are actively traded in a recognised market, with readily available and quoted prices, these have been used to value the securities.
These securities are therefore regarded as having Level 1 fair values, see below.
h Subordinated notes The estimated fair value of the subordinated notes is based on discounted cash flows using interest rates for similar liabilities with the same remaining maturity, credit ranking and rating.
The calculated fair value takes no account of the warrants issued separately to the holders of the 2012 subordinated notes, which have been separately accounted for as a capital contribution within equity on issue.
The warrants attached to the subordinated notes were exercised during September 2015 see note 36.
The following table provides an analysis of financial assets and liabilities held on the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 31 December 2016 m m m m Financial assets: Derivatives held for risk management 12.4 12.4 Debt securities: Asset-backed securities 70.4 70.4 UK Gilts and Supranational bonds 392.1 392.1 Corporate bonds 29.7 29.7 Covered bonds 172.3 172.3 594.1 82.8 676.9 Financial liabilities: Derivatives held for risk management 35.8 35.8 35.8 35.8 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 31 December 2015 m m m m Financial assets: Derivatives held for risk management 6.7 6.7 Debt securities: Asset-backed securities 74.9 74.9 UK Gilts and Supranational bonds 362.3 362.3 Corporate bonds 29.9 29.9 Covered bonds 139.0 139.0 531.2 81.6 612.8 Financial liabilities: Derivatives held for risk management 35.4 35.4 35.4 35.4 197 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Level 1: Fair value determined using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Fair value determined using directly or indirectly observable inputs other than unadjusted quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable.
Level 3: Fair value determined using one or more significant inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The fair values of UK Gilts, Supranational bonds, Corporate bonds and Covered bonds are based on quoted bid prices in active markets.
The fair value of asset-backed securities are based on indicative prices provided by market counterparties, but before relying on these prices, the Group has obtained an understanding of how the prices were derived to ensure that each investment is assigned an appropriate classification within the fair value hierarchy.
The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities are determined using widely recognised valuation methods for financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and use only observable market data that require little management judgement and estimation.
Credit value and debit value adjustments have not been applied as the derivative assets and liabilities are largely collateralised.
Fair value measurement financial assets and liabilities held at amortised cost All the fair values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost are considered to be Level 2 valuations which are determined using directly or indirectly observable inputs other than unadjusted quoted prices, except for debt securities in issue which are Level 1 and loans and advances to customers which are Level 3.
Fair value of transferred assets and associated liabilities Securitisation vehicle The sale of the beneficial ownership of the loans and advances to customers to the securitisation vehicle by the Bank fail the derecognition criteria, and consequently, these loans remain on the statement of financial position of the Group.
The Bank, therefore, recognises a deemed loan financial liability on its statement of financial position and an equivalent deemed loan asset is held on the securitisation vehicles statement of financial position.
As the securitisation vehicle is consolidated into the Group with the Bank, the deemed loans net out in the consolidated accounts.
The deemed loans are repaid as and when principal repayments are made by customers against these transferred loans and advances.
The securitisation vehicle has issued fixed and floating rate notes which are secured on loans and advances to customers.
The notes are redeemable in part from time to time, such redemptions being limited to the net capital received from mortgagors in respect of the underlying assets.
The Group retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.
The Group benefits to the extent to which surplus income generated by the transferred mortgage portfolios exceeds the administration costs of these mortgages.
