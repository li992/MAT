This presentation has been changed to reflect adjusted results as described in note 3 in order to better represent the key metrics used by the directors to monitor and evaluate its performance.
Results for prior periods are re-presented accordingly.
There is no change to the reported totals for any period.
The address of the registered office isGreenside House, 50 Station Road, London N22 7TP.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 45 and note 2.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with our accounting policies.
Basis of accounting The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as issued bythe IASB.
The Group financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union.
The Group financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except where certain assets or liabilities are held at amortised cost or at fair value as described in our accounting policies.
The key accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Adoption of new and revised standards In preparing the Group financial statements for the current period, there have been no new IFRSs, amendments to IFRSs or IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations that have been adopted by the Group.
Standards in issue but not effective A complete list of standards that are in issue but not yet effective is included with our full accounting policies in an appendix to the Annual Report.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments will supersede IAS 39 in its entirety, and is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018.
The potential impacts of the new standard that may impact the Group are: Classification and measurement: New classification and measurement criteria require financial instruments to be classified into one of three categories being amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value.
Classification will be determined by the business model and contractual cash flow characteristics of the instruments: and Hedge accounting: The general hedge accounting mechanisms of IAS 39 have been retained, however greater flexibility has been introduced over the instruments eligible for hedge accounting and effectiveness testing has been more closely aligned with the underlying risk management practices of the entity.
The Group is reviewing the requirements of the new standard to fully determine its impact.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers, with an effective date for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
Early assessment of the requirements of the new standard suggest it will not have a material impact upon the Groups reported performance and the Group will continue to assess the full impact to ensure it is ready to implement the new standard in advance of its effective date.
IFRS 16 Leases will replace IAS 17 in its entirety and is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
It will result in most leases being recognised on the Statement of Financial Position.
The Group continues to assess the full impact of IFRS 16 but since the impact is influenced by interest rates in future years, it is not yet possible to reasonably quantify its effects.
At this stage, the directors assess that the implementation of the new standard may have a material impact upon the Groups reported performance, Statement of Financial Position and operating cash flows.
Key accounting policies Below we set out our key accounting policies.
A complete list of our accounting policies is included in the Annual Report as an appendix on pages 151 to 156.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable from customers and represents amounts receivable for goods and services that the Group is in business to provide, net of discounts, marketing inducements and VAT, as set outbelow.
In the case of the LBO including gaming machines, US, Online Sportsbook and telebetting, Online casino including games on theOnline arcade and other numbers bets and Australian operations, revenue represents gains and losses from gambling activity in the period.
Openpositions are carried at fair value and gains and losses arising on this valuation are recognised in revenue, aswell as gains and losses realised on positions that have closed.
Revenue from the Online poker business reflects the net income rake earned from poker games completed by theperiodend.
In the case of the greyhound stadia, revenue represents income arising from the operation of the greyhound stadia intheperiod, including sales of refreshments and tote income.
Other operating income mostly represents rents receivable on properties let by the Group, bookmaking software licensing income and income from software development, which are recognised on an accruals basis.
Strategic William Hill PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 report Governance Going concern 105 A full description of the Groups business activities, financial position, cash flows, liquidity position, committed facilities and borrowing Financial position, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and performance, is set out in the Strategic Report, including the statements Financial Review, and in notes 22 and 23 to the financial statements.
As highlighted in notes 22 and 23 to the Group financial statements, the Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements from the positive cash flows generated by its trading activities and its available cash resources.
These are supplemented when required by additional drawings under the Groups revolving credit bank loan facilities, which are committed until May 2019.
Whilst there are a number of risks to the Groups trading performance, as summarised in the Managing our risks section on pages 40 to 45, the Group is confident of its ability to continue to access sources of funding in the medium term.
The Group issued 350m of corporate bonds in May 2016 the proceeds from which were used to redeem 300m of corporate bonds which matured in November 2016.
The new bonds are due for redemption in 2023.
The Groups strategic forecasts, based on reasonable assumptions, indicate that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its currently available and expected future facilities and its banking covenants for the period of the strategic forecast.
After making enquiries and after consideration of the Groups existing operations, cash flow forecasts and assessment of business, regulatory and financing risks, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Exceptional items and adjustments The Group presents adjusted results, as described in note 3, which differ from statutory results due to the exclusion of exceptional items and adjustments.
Exceptional items are those items the directors consider to be one-off or material in nature that should be brought to the readers attention in understanding the Groups financial performance.
Adjustments are recurring items that are excluded from internal measures of underlying performance and which are not considered by the directors to be exceptional.
They comprise the following: the amortisation of specific intangible assets recognised in acquisitions: the recognition of interest income on redeemable convertible preference shares see notes 16 and 24 : and fair value movements relating to redeemable convertible preference shares and warrants over equity investments see notes 16 and 24.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in the Statement of Group Accounting Policies included on pages151 to 156, thedirectors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from theseestimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts ofassets and liabilities within the next financial period are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are impaired requires an estimation of the value in useofthe cash-generating units to which the goodwill or intangible assets have been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the directors to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Note 12 provides information on the assumptions used in these financial statements, as well as the degree of sensitivity to changes in assumptions.
The Triennial Review of Stakes and Prizes is currently ongoing and recommendations from the UK Government are expected in the spring.
These could include changes to the regulation of gaming machines and a severely adverse outcome would significantly increase the risk of a material impairment of assets in the Retail division.
The Australian Government is currently undertaking a review of the key regulations governing online wagering, including the Interactive Gambling Act.
The scope of the review includes, amongst other things, both television advertising and credit betting although this is likely to be addressed by State Governments rather than the Federal Government.
Adverse outcomes in either of these areas could significantly impact the cash flows of the business such that an impairment of goodwill in the Australia division may be necessary.
Retirement benefit costs The determination of the pension cost and defined benefit obligation of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme depends on the selection of certain assumptions which include discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth and mortality assumptions.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in subsequent periods.
A full triennial actuarial valuation is being carried out by a qualified independent actuary and this may lead to significant changes in the assumptions used.
Note 32 provides information on the assumptions used in these financial statements, including a sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure scheme liabilities.
William Hill PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Statement of Group Accounting Policies continued Taxation 106 Due to the multinational nature of the Group and the complexity of tax legislation in various jurisdictions in which the Group operates, the directors must apply judgement in estimating the likely outcome of certain tax matters whose final outcome may not be determined for a number of years and which may differ from the current estimation.
In forming that judgement, the directors make assumptions regarding the interpretation and application of tax laws to the circumstances of those specific items.
These estimates are updated in each period until the outcome is finally determined through resolution with a tax authority and or through a legal process.
Differences arising from changes in estimates or from final resolution may be material and will be charged or credited to the Income Statement in the period of re-estimation or resolution.
Within the Group's current tax liability of 25.7m 29 December 2015: 24.5m are amounts of 21.4m 29 December 2015: 23.8m that relate to uncertain tax positions.
The Group evaluates uncertain items, where the tax treatment is subject to interpretation and remains to be agreed with the relevant tax authority.
Provisions for uncertain items are made using a best estimate of the tax expected to be paid, based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant information.
In assessing the appropriate provision for uncertain items, the Group considers progress made in discussions with tax authorities, expert advice on the likely outcome and recent developments in case law.
The Group does not expect the total level of provision to materially change as a result of the resolution of any items within the next financial year.
However, the Groups future tax charge could be affected by several factors such as tax reform, including any arising from the implementation of the OECDs BEPS actions, future corporate acquisitions and disposals, any restructuring of our business or as a consequence of state aid investigations.
Valuations and useful economic lives of assets In assessing the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, the directors use their judgement in selecting suitable valuation methods and inputs and in estimating the useful economic lives UELs of assets.
The range of inputs considered in these valuations varies according to the item being valued and typically includes discount rates and the forecast future performance of the business being acquired, both of which involve a degree of estimation.
UELs are reviewed on a periodic basis and changes are recognised prospectively through an adjustment to the assets amortisation charge in the Income Statement.
A change in UEL of an asset, including the allocation of a definite life to an asset which previously had an indefinite life, may result in a materially different amortisation charge in that and subsequent years.

Non-current asset information is based on physical location for tangible assets or primary operating location of the company using the asset for all other assets.
Exceptional items and adjustments Adjusted results The Group reports adjusted results, both internally and externally, that differ from statutory results prepared in accordance with IFRS.
These adjusted results, which include our KPIs of adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS, are considered by the directors to be a useful reflection of the underlying performance of the Group and its businesses, since they exclude transactions which impair visibility of the underlying activity in divisions.
More specifically, the directors judge that visibility can be impaired in one or both of the following instances: a transaction is of such a material or infrequent nature that it would obscure an understanding of underlying outcomes and trends in revenues, costs or other components of performance for example, a significant impairment charge : or a transaction that results from a corporate activity has neither a close relationship to our businesses operations nor any associated operational cash flows for example, the amortisation of intangibles recognised on acquisitions.
Adjusted results are used as the primary measures of business performance within the Group and align with the results shown in management accounts, with the key uses being: management and Board reviews of performance against expectations and over time, including assessments of divisional performance see note 2 and the Strategic Report : Remuneration Committee assessments of targets and performance for management remuneration purposes see pages 68 to 89 : in support of business decisions by the Board and by management, encompassing both strategic and operational levels of decisionmaking: and assessments of loan covenant compliance, which refer to adjusted results.
The Groups policies on adjusted measures have been consistently applied over time, but they are not defined by IFRS and, therefore, may differ from adjusted measures as used by other companies.
The Consolidated Income Statement presents adjusted results alongside statutory measures, with the reconciling items being itemised and described below.
We discriminate between two types of reconciling items: exceptional items and defined other adjustments.
William Hill PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 3.
Exceptional items and adjustments continued 110 The directors note, for readers benefit, some presentational and disclosure changes from prior years that we believe improve clarity: the key profitability metric of adjusted operating profit was previously termed Operating profit.
We believe that the change emphasises the non-statutory nature of this measure more clearly: the Consolidated Income Statement previously showed a column for Before exceptional items.
We believe that it is more useful to present an Adjusted column instead, since this now allows adjusted operating profit to be visible in the primary financial statements alongside statutory performance: and the layout of this note, which replaces the exceptional items note in prior years, consolidates disclosures of all reconciling items between Adjusted and statutory results, rather than solely exceptional items.
None of these changes reflects a change in definition or measurement of any metric and, therefore, the presentation is reflected in the comparative disclosures without any restatement of values.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those items the directors consider to be one-off or material in nature that should be brought to the readers attention in understanding the Groups financial performance.
Adjustments Adjustments are recurring items that are excluded from internal measures of underlying performance and which are not considered by the directors to be exceptional.
Exceptional items and adjustments are as follows: 52 weeks 52 weeks ended ended Exceptional 27 December Exceptional 29 December items Adjustments 2016 items Adjustments 2015 m m m m m m Operating Corporate transaction costs 9.8 9.8 Restructuring costs 10.2 10.2 1 Portfolio shop closures 0.4 0.4 1.8 1.8 VAT repayment 0.2 0.2 Amortisation of acquired intangibles 6.4 6.4 60.6 8.1 68.7 Fair value movements on derivative financial instruments 9.9 9.9 19.6 16.3 35.9 59.0 8.1 67.1 Non-operating Investment income on redeemable convertible preference shares 3.2 3.2 3.2 3.2 Total exceptional items and adjustments before tax 19.6 13.1 32.7 59.0 8.1 67.1 Tax on exceptional items and adjustments 2.5 0.5 3.0 17.9 2.2 20.1 Exceptional tax items 19.4 19.4 Total exceptional items and adjustments 17.1 12.6 29.7 21.7 5.9 27.6 1 As a result of HM Treasurys announcement in March 2014 of an increase in Machine Games Duty, the Group closed a portfolio of 108 shops during 2014 and provided for onerous leases and other expenses.
The Group has exited a number of these leases in the period and the difference between provisions held and any final settlement is credited or charged to exceptional items, consistently with the original provisions.
Corporate transaction costs During 2016, the Group incurred material costs relating to M&A activity, reflecting two proposed corporate transactions.
These costs are presented as exceptional, since they are material in size, one-off in nature and would otherwise distort an understanding of our underlying cost base.
Strategic William Hill PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 report Governance 3.
Exceptional items and adjustments continued 111 Restructuring costs Financial statements The Group commenced substantial corporate restructurings in 2016, encompassing cost optimisation and business model initiatives.
These initiatives, whose costs include fees for external advisers and the cost of staff redundancies, are substantial in scope and impact and do not form part of recurring operational or management activities that the directors would consider part of our underlying performance.
For these reasons, the directors judge the directly attributable cost impact to be exceptional.

The effective tax rate in respect of total results was 9.3% 52 weeks ended 29 December 2015: minus 2.8%.
The current periods charge was lower than the UK statutory rate of20% mainly due to lower effective tax rates on overseas profits, adjustments in respect of prior periods and the deferred tax credit arising on the enacted fall in the rate of UK corporation tax.
The difference between the total tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the profit before tax is as follows: 52 weeks ended 27 December 2016 52 weeks ended 29 December 2015 Exceptional Exceptional items and Statutory items and Statutory Adjusted adjustments total Adjusted adjustments total m m m m m m Profit before tax 214.0 32.7 181.3 251.8 67.1 184.7 Tax on Group profit at standard UK corporation tax rate of 20% 2015: 20.25% 42.8 6.5 36.3 51.0 13.6 37.4 Impact of changes in statutory tax rates 6.1 6.1 12.2 12.2 Different tax rates in overseas territories 13.9 13.9 17.4 6.5 23.9 Accrual of liabilities for uncertain tax positions 10.4 10.4 8.1 8.1 Tax on share of results of associates 0.2 0.2 0.5 0.5 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 14.9 14.9 0.5 19.4 18.9 Non-deductible expenditure 1.7 3.5 5.2 4.8 4.8 Total tax charge credit 19.8 3.0 16.8 34.3 39.5 5.2 The reconciliation uses the UK statutory tax rate as the majority of the Groups profits are subject to tax in the UK.
Non-deductible expenditure includes exceptional costs that are non-revenue related and other non-deductible capital payments that have been charged to the Income Statement.
The deduction for tax rates in overseas territories reflects the lower effective tax rate on profits earned in Gibraltar, partially offset by a higher tax rate on US profits.
The tax credit for the change in statutory tax rates reflects the enacted fall in the UK rate of corporation tax to 17% in 2020, from the previously enacted rate of 18%, and results from the fall in the deferred tax liability on the book value of UK LBO licences.
The tax credit in respect of prior periods reflects the routine closure of prior period tax returns with tax authorities.
The effective tax rate in 2017 is expected to be c14% and should remain at around this level whilst the business operates in the same territories and at the same scale.

Licences are judged to have an indefinite life and are accordingly not amortised but are subject to annual impairment reviews.
The directors consider that the Groups licences have an indefinite life owing to: the fact that the Group is a significant operator in awellestablished market: the proven and sustained demand for bookmaking services: and the Groups track record of successfully renewing itsbetting permits and licences.
Acquired technology platforms include bookmaking-related software platforms and systems recognised at fair value in business combinations.
Brands, trade names and customer relationships This category of assets includes brands, trade names and customer relationships recognised in business combinations.
These include the following significant items: i US assets In 2012, the Group acquired three US businesses.
Brands and other assets of 13.1m were recognised and are being amortised over lives ofbetween three and ten years.
ii Sportingbet assets In March 2013, the Group acquired businesses and assets from the Sportingbet group, including operations under the Centrebet brand.
Brand and customer relationship assets were recognised of 163.1m and these are being amortised over lives ranging up to12 years.
The Brand assets were fully amortised in the current period.
iii Grand Parade assets In 2016, the Group acquired Grand Parade Limited note 17.
Customer relationships and brand assets of 2.8m were recognised on acquisition and are being amortised over a life of 18 months.
Impairment reviews The Group performs an annual impairment review for goodwill andother intangible assets with indefinite lives, by comparing the carrying amount of these assets with their recoverable amount.
This is an area where the directors exercise judgement and estimation, as noted on page 105.
The most recent test was conducted at 27 December 2016.
Testing is carried out by allocating the carrying value of these assets to cash generating units CGUs and determining the recoverable amounts of those CGUs through value in use calculations.
Where the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the assets, the assets are considered as not impaired.
William Hill PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 12.
Intangible assets continued 116 Value in use calculations are based upon estimates of future cash flows derived from the Groups long range adjusted operating profit forecasts by division.
Adjusted operating profit forecasts are derived from the Groups annual strategic planning or similarly scoped exercise.
These are high-level forecasts, looking four years ahead, with separate extrapolation of net revenue and expenses by division based on a combination of recently observable trends, management expectations and known future events.
For the purposes of the value in use calculation, the long-range operating forecast is extended to cover a five-year period.
Year one of the long-range adjusted operating profit forecast is replaced immediately prior to use if an annual budget for that year has been subsequently approved.
This is done to ensure that year one of the test reflects the latest detailed planning for that period.
The implications, if any, of a materially different adjusted operating profit outcome for annual budget versus the relevant year of the long range forecast are also considered at that point.
Cash flows beyond that five-year period are extrapolated using long-term growth rates as estimated for each CGU separately.
Both the following years budget and the long-range adjusted operating profit forecasts are approved by the Board.
Discount rates are applied to each CGUs cash flows that reflect both the time value of money and the risks that apply to the cash flows ofthatCGU.
These are estimated by management on the basis of typical debt and equity costs for listed gaming and betting companies, withsamples chosen where applicable from comparable markets or territories as the CGU.
Further risk premia and discounts are applied, ifappropriate, to this rate to reflect the risk profile of the specific CGU relative to the market in which it operates.
Our discount rates are calculated on a pre-tax basis and the calculations incorporate estimates of the tax rates that will apply to the future cash flows of the applicableCGU.
The principal assumptions underlying our cash flow forecasts are as follows: we assume that the underlying business model will continue to operate on a comparable basis, as adjusted for key sporting events, expected regulatory or tax changes and planned business initiatives: our forecasts anticipate the continuation of recent growth or decline trends in staking, gaming net revenues and expenses, as adjusted forchanges in our business model or expected changes in the wider industry or economy: we assume that we will achieve our target sports betting gross win margins as set for each territory, which we base upon our experience of the outturn of sports results over the long term, given the tendency for sports results to vary in the short term but revert to a norm over alonger term: and in our annual budget process, expenses incorporate a bottom-up estimation of our cost base.
For employee remuneration, this takes into account staffing numbers and models by division, while other costs are assessed separately by category, with principal assumptions including an extrapolation of recent cost inflation trends and the expectation that we will incur costs in line with agreed contractual rates.
The other significant assumptions incorporated into our impairment reviews are those relating to discount rates and long-term growth assumptions, as noted below separately for each CGU.
CGUs Long-term Discount rate growth rate Cash generating unit % % Retail 9.0 2.6 Online 8.1 2.6 Stadia 9.0 2.6 US 12.4 3.0 Australia 12.1 2.6 No impairment was identified in any of the CGUs tested.
The Retail CGU is defined as the Retail segment, which we describe in note 2.
The CGU holds goodwill of 680.7m and other intangibles with indefinite lives of 484.3m.
The Online CGU is defined as the Online segment, which we describe in note 2, and holds goodwill of 192.8m, including goodwill of 8.9m recognised from the acquisition of Grand Parade Limited note 17.
The Stadia CGU is defined as the combined assets and operations of the two greyhound stadia operated by the business, which are included within the Other segment as described in note 2.
Goodwill allocated to this CGU is 7.1m.
The US CGU is defined as the US segment, which we describe in note 2.
Goodwill at the balance sheet date was valued at24.4m.
The Australia CGU is defined as the Australia segment as described in note 2.
This CGU includes goodwill of 304.5m at the balance sheet date.
Sensitivity of impairment reviews For CGUs reviewed at 27 December 2016, no impairment would occur under any reasonably possible changes in assumptions upon which therecoverable amount was estimated.

Interests in associates continued 121 The following financial information relates to SIS as at and for the 52 weeks ended 27 December 2016: Financial statements 27 December 29 December 2016 2015 m m Total assets 145.6 155.2 Total liabilities 59.2 64.4 Total revenue 223.9 230.0 Total profit after tax 16.4 20.9 NeoGames On 7 August 2015, William Hill Organization Limited acquired 30.9% of the ordinary share capital of NeoGames S. a. r. l NeoGames, a company incorporated in Luxembourg, for a total cash consideration of US$25.0m.
The Group is able to exert influence over NeoGames by way of its equity holding and its two nominated representatives on the Board of directors, who collectively can cast 30.9% of any Board votes.
As part of the acquisition, William Hill Organization Limited has an option to acquire the remaining share capital in either 2019 or 2021.
The option is exercisable at the full discretion of William Hill and the price payable will be determined at the time of exercise on the basis of NeoGamess financial performance.
Should the option not be exercised, other shareholders in NeoGames have the option to repurchase our stake under the same valuation mechanism.
No initial value was recognised in respect of these options at acquisition and the fair value of these options was nil at 27 December 2016.
NeoGames is a leading iLottery software and service provider to lotteries worldwide, including in Europe and the USA.
The results recognised are based on management accounts from acquisition date to 27 December 2016.
The following financial information relates to NeoGames as at and for the 52 weeks ended 27 December 2016: 27 December 29 December 2016 2015 m m Total assets 9.9 13.9 Total liabilities 20.6 16.5 Total revenue 6.1 2.4 Total loss after tax 7.1 10.8 Lucky Choice Limited and 49s Limited William Hill Organization Limited also holds directly or indirectly 33% of the entire share capital of Lucky Choice Limited and of49s Limited.
These companies were formed for the purpose of promoting and publicising certain numbers betting formats.
In the opinion of the directors, the results of these companies are not material to the results of the Group.
Consequently, the investments have beenstated at cost and have not been accounted for under the equity method, which would normally be appropriate for an associated undertaking.
A dividend of 0.4m was received from 49s Limited which was recognised within share of results of associates note 4.
Investments On 4 April 2016, the Group entered into a long-term commercial agreement with NYX Gaming Group Limited NYX and invested 80.0m into redeemable convertible preference shares issued by NYX.
Although the 80.0m investment has been made into preference shares by legal form, in substance these are akin to convertible notes and have therefore been accounted for as such Convertible Notes.
In addition, on 20 April 2016, an investment of CAD $18.8m 10.3m was made into ordinary equity of NYX, representing 6.8m ordinary shares Ordinary Shares, valued at 9.7m, and 1.7m warrants Warrants, valued at 0.6m.
The warrants each entitle the acquisition of one ordinary share at the price of CAD $3.50 for a period of three years.
On 27 May 2016, the Group agreed to loan 3.2m to NYX Loan.
Convertible Notes These are convertible into NYX ordinary shares or redeemable in cash, with an implied interest coupon of 6% payable in kind at the term of ten years.
This investment, along with 1.7m of associated transaction costs, is judged to be a loan with an embedded derivative which has been accounted for separately.
Convertible element The convertible element, which is categorised as fair value through profit or loss, was recognised at an initial fair value of 44.1m within non-current derivative financial instruments.
The valuation was performed using a Black-Scholes Monte Carlo model framework and this will be re-performed at future reporting dates, with movements recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The fair value at 27 December 2016 was 34.5m, leading to a loss in the period of 9.6m recognised as an adjustment, as defined by note 3, within operating expenses.
William Hill PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 16.
Investments continued 122 Loan element The loan element, which is categorised as a loans and receivables financial asset, was accounted for at an initial value of 37.5m within loans receivable in non-current assets.
This represents the remaining transaction price paid, including transaction costs, after deducting the fair value of the convertible element.
This will be accounted for on an amortised cost basis at an effective interest rate of 13.6%.
Theinterest accrued in the period was 3.2m which has been classified as investment income in the Consolidated Income Statement as an adjustment, as defined by note 3.
The carrying amount of the loan at 27 December 2016 was 40.7m and the directors consider this to approximate its fair value.
Ordinary Shares The ordinary shares are held as an available-for-sale financial asset and therefore they are revalued to fair value at each period end with any movements recognised in other comprehensive income.
At 27 December 2016 the ordinary shares investment was reflected in the accounts as an asset of 5.3m, based on a share price of CAD $1.29 per share, within investments.
This led to a loss for the period of 4.4m.
Warrants The warrants are a derivative and are therefore categorised as fair value through profit or loss.
These are revalued to fair value at each period end with any movements recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
At 27 December 2016 the warrants were valued at 0.3m and held within non-current derivative financial instruments.
This led to a loss in the period of 0.3m recognised as an adjustment, as defined by note 3, within operating expenses.

Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks.
Financial risk management is primarily carried out by the Group Treasurer under risk management policies approved by the Board of directors and supervised by the CFO.
The Board approves written principles for risk management, as described in the Strategic Report on page 40.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group comprise liquidity risk, financing risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and pensions risk.
These risks are managed as described below.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group has insufficient funds available to settle its liabilities as they fall due.
The Groups business generates strong operating cash flows and the Group aims to maintain sufficient cash balances to meet its anticipated working capital requirements based on regularly updated cash flow forecasts.
Liquidity requirements that cannot be met from operational cash flow or existing cash resources are satisfied by drawings under the Groups RCF.
The Group maintains adequate committed but undrawn facilities to meet such requirements.
Details of the Groups borrowing arrangements are provided in note 22.
The table below details the Groups expected maturity for its derivative and non-derivative financial liabilities.
The table hasbeen drawn up on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the financial instruments including interest that will be receivable or payable on them.
Where applicable, interest payments in respect of the floating rate liabilities are estimated based on the one month sterling LIBOR rate at the period enddate.

Financial risk management continued 127 Capital management and financing risk Financial statements The Group seeks to maintain an appropriate capital structure which enables it to continue as a going concern, supports its business strategy and takes into account the wider economic environment.
The Groups capital comprises equity and debt finance and these elements are managed to balance the requirements of the business and the interests of shareholders and debt stakeholders.
The Group manages its capital structure through cash flows from operations, returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, theraising or repayment ofdebt and the raising of equity capital from investors.
Financing risk is the risk that the Group is unable to access sufficient finance to refinance its debt obligations as they fall due.
The Group manages this risk by maintaining a balance between different funding sources including equity and debt.
It seeks tomitigate its debt financing risk by diversifying its sources of loan finance.
The bank loan and corporate bond markets are currently used for this purpose.
The Board also seeks to mitigate the Groups refinancing risk by having an appropriately balanced debt maturity profile.
Net debt to EBITDA ratio The Group assesses its debt capital structure primarily through use of the net debt to EBITDA ratio.
As one of the financial covenants under its bank loan facility, the Group must ensure that its net debt to rolling 12-month EBITDA does not exceed 3.5 times.
Based on current forecasts, the Group expects to operate within these covenant limits throughout the lifetime of the facility.
Net debt for covenant purposes and EBITDA for covenant purposes are not statutory measures and may differ from loan covenant measures as used by other companies.
The net debt to EBITDA ratio was: 27 December 29 December 2016 2015 m m Nominal value of bank loans Nominal value of corporate bonds 725.0 675.0 Counter indemnity obligations under bank guarantees 4.1 3.4 Cash excluding customer balances and other restricted cash note 19 111.0 190.2 Net debt for covenant purposes 618.1 488.2 EBITDA for covenant purposes see table below 347.8 372.1 Net debt to EBITDA ratio 1.8 1.3 EBITDA for covenant purposes is adjusted profit before depreciation, amortisation, interest, tax and share-based payments and is calculated as follows: 27 December 29 December 2016 2015 m m Adjusted profit before interest and tax 261.5 291.4 Depreciation 31.6 32.2 Amortisation of intangible assets 48.6 41.3 Share-based payments 6.1 7.2 EBITDA for covenant purposes 347.8 372.1 Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk from counterparties defaulting on their obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
It arises in relation to transactions with commercial counterparties and to transactions with financial institutions with which theGroup deposits its surplus funds and from counterparties with which the Group has entered into derivative financial transactions for hedging purposes.
Italso arises from customers who have been granted credit with which to bet with theGroup.
The Group manages its financial counterparty credit risk by limiting or otherwise closely monitoring the amount that can be deposited with any one institution andbyrestricting the counterparties with which it will deposit funds to institutions with specified minimum credit ratings or which meet specified criteria.
The Groups policy is to mitigate its credit risk with respect to derivative transactions by using a number of different counterparties for material transactions.
As at 27 December 2016, the Group had no derivative contracts for currency hedging purposes.
During the period, the Group entered into a long-term commercial agreement with NYX Gaming Group Limited NYX and invested 80.0m into redeemable convertible preference shares issued by NYX note 16.
These are convertible into ordinary shares or redeemable in cash with an implied interest coupon of 6% payable in kind at the term of ten years.
The directors have assessed that there is not a material credit risk with NYX being unable to settle the cash at the end of the term.
William Hill PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 23.
Financial risk management continued 128 Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises primarily from the Groups borrowings.
The Group has a policy which aims to maintain a balance between fixed and floating rate debt exposures appropriate to the expected performance of the business, the Groups debt burden and the wider economic environment.
At 27 December 2016, all of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates.
Based on the current level of borrowings, a 100 basis points change in interest rates would have the following impact on the Group financialstatements: Increase of Decrease of 100 basis 100 basis points points m m Increase decrease in profit 2.3 1.7 Increase decrease in equity reserves 2.3 1.7 The directors have used a 100 basis points change in interest rates as we assess that this best illustrates the impact of plausible changes in interest rates on the Group's performance and financial position.
Currency risk The Group earns revenues in foreign currencies, primarily Australian Dollars, Euros and US Dollars, which exposes it to foreign exchange risk.
The Group mitigates this risk by incurring costs in currencies matching its revenues.
Any remaining transactional foreign currency exposure is not considered to be material and is not hedged.
Material individual foreign currency transaction exposures are considered for hedging on an ad hoc basis.
The Group is also exposed to foreign currency accounting translation risk on the earnings and net assets of its overseas operations which are denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group does not hedge such translation risk.
Revenue by currency Revenue by currency is analysed below.
52 weeks 52 weeks ended ended 27 December 29 December 2016 2015 % % Sterling 82.3 84.5 Australian dollar 7.2 6.2 Euro 5.7 5.2 US dollar 3.8 3.2 Other currencies 1.0 0.9 Total 100.0 100.0 Pensions risk The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes for its employees.
Pensions risk arises inrespect of thedefinedbenefit scheme where the cost of funding retirement benefits ultimately falls upon the Group.
The last triennial actuarial valuation asat30September 2013 showed a funding deficit on the defined benefit scheme of 47.4m.
The Group has agreed to make deficit repair contributions of 9.4m per annum until May 2019.
In addition it contributes 1.9m per annum towards the cost of insured death benefits and other administrative expenses of running the scheme.
An updated triennial actuarial valuation as at 30 September 2016 is currently being undertaken.
The Group seeks to manage the cash flow impact arising from pensions risk.
Accordingly, the defined benefit scheme was closed to newentrants in 2002 and was restricted as to future accrual from April 2011.
The Group attempts to further manage its exposure by agreeing with the Pension Scheme Trustees the assumptions to be used to calculate the scheme liabilities, the investment strategy tobefollowed and any cash contributions to be made by the Group.

Financial instruments continued 130 Ordinary shares The ordinary shares are valued based on the quoted share price of NYX.
Convertible element of Convertible Notes The convertible element of the convertible notes is valued using a Black-Scholes Monte Carlo model framework performed by a third party valuation specialist.
The key inputs used in the model are as follows: 27 December 2016 Share price CAD $1.29 Expected dividend yield 0.0% Risk free interest rate 2.0% Expected volatility 87.3% A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the key unobserved inputs in the model as illustrated in the table that follows.
The illustrations consider the single change shown, with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged.
In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption although this is not always the case.
Assumption Changes in assumption Impact on fair value Expected dividend yield Increase by 1% Decrease of 3.6m Expected volatility Increase by 1% Increase of 0.2m Default intensity Increase by 1.3% Increase of 0.1m Warrants The warrants are valued using a binomial tree option pricing model.

Ante post bet liabilities Ante post bet liabilities are valued using methods and inputs that are not based upon observable market data and all fair value movements on the balance are recognised in revenue in the Income Statement.
There are no reasonably possible changes toassumptions or inputs that would lead to material changes in the fair value determined, although the final value will be determined by future sporting results.
The principal assumptions relate to anticipated gross win margins on unsettled bets.
Forward currency contracts Forward currency contracts were classified as level 2 in the hierarchy, as their value was determined using inputs that were observable, either directly or indirectly.
Changes in their fair value were recorded in the Income Statement, except in cases where the hedging arrangement qualifies for hedge accounting.
As at 27 December 2016, the Group had no forward contracts outstanding.

Derivative financial instruments 131 Details of the Groups derivative financial instruments are given below.
Financial statements Ante post bets Ante post bets are a liability arising from an open position at the period end date in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for derivative financial instruments.
Ante post bets at the period end totalled 14.0m 29 December 2015: 13.8m and are classified as currentliabilities.
Forward contracts The Group held no forward currency contracts at period end 29 December 2015: asset of0.1m.
NYX investment Convertible element of Convertible Notes On 4 April 2016, the Group invested 80.0m into redeemable convertible preference shares issued by NYX note 16.
Although the 80.0m investment has been made into preference shares by legal form, in substance these are akin to convertible notes and have therefore been accounted as a loan with an embedded derivative which has been accounted for separately.
The embedded derivative Convertible element of Convertible Notes was recognised at an initial fair value at acquisition of 44.1m.
At 27 December 2016, this has been revalued using a Black-Scholes Monte Carlo model framework in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for derivative financial instruments with a fair value of 34.5m, which is classified as a non-current asset.
Warrants On 20 April 2016, an investment of CAD $18.8m 10.3m was made into ordinary equity of NYX note 16.
This investment included the purchase of 1.7m warrants, which were valued at 0.6m at acquisition.
The warrants each entitle the acquisition of one ordinary share at a price of CAD $3.50 for a period of three years.
In accordance with the Groups accounting policy for derivative financial instruments, the warrants have been revalued to fair value of 0.3m at 27 December 2016 and are classified as non-current assets.

The 17% future rate of UK corporation tax was enacted in September 2016.
The Group has recognised 2.8m of deferred tax assets, including 1.0m of losses, which have been recognised as the losses are in companies which are anticipated to make future profits.
The Group has no material unrecognised deferred tax assets.

Retirement benefit schemes 136 The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
The UK schemes are operated under asingle trust and the assets of all the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
The respective costs ofthese schemes are as follows: 52 weeks 52 weeks ended ended 27 December 29 December 2016 2015 m m Defined contribution schemes charged to profit before interest and tax 11.9 11.1 Defined benefit scheme charged to profit before interest and tax 2.0 2.1 Defined benefit scheme credited to finance costs 1.0 1.2 Defined benefit scheme charged to other comprehensive income 17.8 14.9 30.7 26.9 Defined contribution schemes The defined contribution schemes, to which both the Group and employees contribute to fund the benefits, are available for all eligible employees.
The only obligation of the Group with respect to these schemes is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income in respect of these schemes represents contributions payable to the schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the respective schemes.
At 27 December 2016, contributions of 1.1m 29 December 2015: 0.1m duein respect ofthecurrent reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme The Group also operates a defined benefit scheme in the UK for eligible employees which closed to new members in 2002.
Under the scheme, employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 1.67% and 3.33% of final pensionable pay for each year of service on attainment of a retirement age of 63.
With effect from 1 April 2011, the defined benefit scheme was closed to future accrual but maintains the link for benefits accrued up to 31 March 2011 with future salary increases up to a maximum of 5% per annum.
Employed members of this scheme were automatically transferred into one of the defined contribution schemes.
The Group makes a contribution towards the costs of administering the scheme.
For the purposes of preparing the information disclosed in these accounts, a full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 30September 2013 and updated to 27 December 2016 by a qualified independent actuary.
The present values of the defined benefit obligation and the related current service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
Funding valuation The general principles adopted by the Trustees for the purposes of this funding valuation are that the assumptions used, taken as a whole, will be sufficiently prudent for pensions already in payment to continue to be paid and to reflect the commitments which will arise from members accrued pension rights.
The Group expects to make deficit repair contributions of 9.4m to the scheme during 2017 plus a 1.9m contribution towards the cost of life assurance and costs of running the scheme.
An updated triennial actuarial valuation is currently underway.
The IAS 19 position of the plan, as reflected in our Statement of Financial Position, is generally expected to differ from that of the triennial funding valuation assessment.
The principal reasons for this difference are the requirements for prudence in the funding valuation which contrasts with the IAS 19 best estimate principle and the application of a prudent estimate of asset returns in the funding valuation which contrasts with the IAS 19 requirement to use a discount rate derived from high quality corporate bonds.
Since these approaches differ, it is possible for the IAS 19 basis to reflect a surplus despite the funding valuation presenting a deficit, with corresponding deficit repair contributions.
We have concluded, following professional advice, that no adjustment is required to our accounting to reflect either the recovery of the current IAS 19 surplus or a minimum funding requirement: this reflects that the Group has an unconditional right to recover that surplus in the future.
We have also concluded, given that advice, that the proposed changes to IFRIC 14 would not have any effect upon our accounting treatment.
Disclosure of principal assumptions The financial assumptions used by the actuary in determining the present value of the defined benefit schemes liabilitieswere: 27 December 29 December 2016 2015 Rate of increase of salaries 3.30% 3.10% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.10% 3.10% Rate of increase for deferred benefits 2.30% 2.10% Discount rate 2.70% 3.80% Rate of RPI inflation 3.30% 3.10% Rate of CPI inflation 2.30% 2.10% Strategic William Hill PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 report Governance 32.
Retirement benefit schemes continued 137 In accordance with the relevant accounting standard, the discount rate has been determined by reference to market yields at the period Financial end date on high quality fixed income investments at a term consistent with the expected duration of the liabilities.
Price inflation is statements determined by the difference between the yields on fixed and index-linked government bonds with an adjustment to allow for differences in the demand for these bonds, which can distort this figure.
The Bank of England target inflation rate has also been considered in setting this assumption.
Theexpected rate of salary growth and pension increases are set with reference to the expected rate of inflation.
No change has been made to the basis of inflation applied to pension increases in the scheme.
The mortality assumption is kept under review and has been updated.
The current life expectancies for a member underlying the value ofthe accrued liabilities are: 27 December 29 December 2016 2015 Life expectancy at age 65 years years Male retiring now 22.5 22.4 Male retiring in 25 years time 24.7 24.6 Female retiring now 25.3 25.2 Female retiring in 25 years time 27.6 27.5 The assets in the scheme are set out in the table below.

In addition, changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the market value of the scheme assets, which may or may not offset the change in assumptions.
Assumption Changes in assumption Impact on defined benefit liabilities Discount rate Decrease by 0.25% p. a.
Increase of 20.7m Discount rate Increase by 0.25% p. a.
Decrease of 19.3m Rate of increase in inflation Decrease by 0.25% p. a.

Increase of 13.3m Members assumed to live Life expectancy oneyearlonger Increase of 14.0m If the change in assumptions were in the opposite direction to that shown above, the impact on the defined benefit liabilities would be ofasimilar magnitude, but in the opposite direction.

Retirement benefit schemes continued 139 Nature and extent of the risks arising from financial instruments held by the defined benefit scheme Financial Pension assets and liabilities pre-tax of 430.5m and 415.0m respectively were held on the Groups Consolidated Statementof Financial statements Position at 27 December 2016 29 December 2015: 365.5m and 342.5m respectively.
Through the scheme the Group is exposed toa number ofpotential risks as described below: asset volatility: the schemes defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: however, in addition to corporate bonds, the scheme invests in asset classes other than corporate bonds which may out or underperform corporate bonds in the long term but provide volatility and risk in the short term: changes in bond yields: the risk of a decrease in bond yields, which increases the value of the scheme liabilities, is partially offset by the upside benefit of an increase in the value of the schemes bondholdings: inflation risk: a significant proportion of the schemes defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation and therefore higher inflation would result in a higher defined benefit liability.
Although a proportion of the schemes investments are in inflation-linked securities which should compensate for any changes in inflation, the balance of the schemes assets is either unaffected by inflation or only loosely correlated with inflation and therefore an increase in inflation would also increase deficit: and life expectancy: if the schemes members live longer than expected, the schemes benefits will need to be paid for longer, increasing the defined benefit obligation longevity risk.
The Trustees and the Company manage the investment risk asset volatility in the scheme by investing c90% of the schemes investments in Liability Driven Investments LDI strategies which aim to invest in assets whose values move broadly in tandem with changes in liability values arising from market movements.
The Company accepts and indemnifies the other residual risks in the scheme including longevity risk.
Funding Alongside the risk assessment above, the Group has agreed a deficit recovery plan with the Trustees aimed at eliminating the deficit over the period to 2019, as described in note 23.
