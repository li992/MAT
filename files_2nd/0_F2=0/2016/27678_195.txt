Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance 138 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Post-employment holding periods The committee has chosen not to require executive directors to hold shares for a period after vesting or exercise, or after leaving the Group.
However, the terms of the MSIP awards include a post-vesting holding period equal to 50% of the vested award on a net of tax basis if applicable, in a form that will track shareholder experience post-separation of the Group, as closely as possible over the period, which might include a restriction on the ability of the executive to exercise 50% of the option during that one-year period.
