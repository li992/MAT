Alternative performance measures The Directors believe it is appropriate to present the results of the Group using alternative performance measures in order to: Provide decision useful information to users about the Groups underlying performance, as reported performance can be distorted by non-recurring items or can be influenced by market factors that are outside of the control of the Group Present information in a way that reflects how the Directors monitor and measure the performance of the Group.
The alternative performance measures presented aim to supplement the reported results presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS by providing further clarity on the performance of the Group.
The following section provides an indication of the purpose and definition of each of the alternative performance measures presented in the Annual Report and Accounts, together with an appropriate cross reference to where the financial information can be found within the IFRS financial statements.
Total revenue The total revenue figure of 5,214.2 million as shown in the income statement on page 90 includes Group revenue of 4,394.9 million together with the Groups share of revenue from Joint Ventures of 819.3 million.
The Group includes Joint Venture revenue in its headline revenue figure to reflect the fact that a significant proportion of the Groups operational delivery activities are undertaken through Joint Ventures.
B. Organic growth Organic growth is the growth achieved compared to the previous year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements as disclosed on page 47 and incremental contributions from businesses acquired in either the current or prior year.

Net borrowing and average net borrowing The Directors view net borrowing rather than cash and cash equivalents as the most appropriate measure of liquidity for the Group as this measure includes all sources of financing used to fund the Groups operations.
Note 18 on page 115 shows the sources of financing that are included in net borrowing in addition to cash and cash equivalents.
Average net borrowing is calculated as the average of the net borrowing at the end of the previous financial year and each of the month end net borrowing figures as reported to the Board in the current financial year.
