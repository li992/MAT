Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill The following units have significant amounts of goodwill: 1 2016 2015 m m Construction services excluding the Middle East segment UK construction 239.1 239.1 Canada construction 10.7 8.7 249.8 247.8 Support services segment UK services 1,191.2 1,191.2 Canada services 130.0 105.3 1,321.2 1,296.5 Total goodwill 1,571.0 1,544.3 1 Restated for the retrospective adjustment to provisional amounts recognised on acquisitions in 2015.
Each year, and whenever events or a change in the economic environment indicates a risk of impairment, the Group reviews the value of goodwill balances allocated to its cash-generating units CGU.
In the absence of any identified impairment risks, tests are performed based on internal valuations of each CGU.
Management consider Support services, Public Private Partnership projects, Middle East construction services and Construction services excluding the Middle East as distinct reporting segments.
Goodwill has been allocated to the applicable CGUs within the Construction services excluding the Middle East and Support services reporting segments detailed above.
CGUs have been identified within the reporting segments as those businesses that generate cash inflows largely independently of other businesses within the Group, and which are subject to independent management.
Following its acquisition in 2015, Ask Real Estate Limited, a business based in the UK, has been integrated into the Groups Construction services reporting segment and consequently the goodwill recognised on this acquisition of 6.1 million has been allocated to the UK construction CGU.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The value-in-use in 2016 was determined on a similar basis to 2015.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to revenue and direct costs during the period.
These assumptions were reviewed in 2016 in the light of the continuing challenging economic environment.
The adverse impact of macro-economic factors on the financial stability of our customers, partners and suppliers continues to be mitigated by applying rigorous selectivity criteria in relation to their financial stability, the security of project funding and contractual terms and conditions.
Discount rates have been estimated based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
Whilst the Group has four CGUs, the risks and rewards associated with Construction services excluding the Middle East are consistent, and therefore one discount rate has been applied to each CGU.
Similarly the risks and rewards encountered in the Support services CGUs are consistent and therefore one discount rate has been applied to each CGU.
In determining the pre-tax discount rate management has derived a Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity and then weighting the overall cost of capital for the Group by equity and debt.
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows for the CGUs were updated in 2016 to reflect current market conditions and resulted in the discount rate for the Construction services excluding the Middle East segment remaining unchanged at 9.7 per cent 2015: 9.7 per cent and for the Support services segment remaining unchanged at 8.6 per cent 2015: 8.6 per cent.
The cash flows used to determine the value-in-use calculations are from the latest three-year forecasts approved by management, which are based upon secured and probable orders and the Groups overall strategic direction.
The cash flows are extrapolated from year four, with a terminal value using a growth rate of 2.5 per cent.
This growth rate does not exceed the long-term industry average and reflects the synergies from acquisitions.
Management has undertaken sensitivity analysis on a number of key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations.
Sensitivity analysis on the discount rate shows that the discount rate would have to increase to a minimum of 21.3 per cent for Construction services excluding the Middle East and to a minimum of 19.0 per cent for Support services before an impairment was triggered in any CGU.
On the basis of the sensitivity analysis undertaken in relation to cash flows, management concluded that there is a more than adequate amount of headroom in the value-in-use calculations before an impairment would be triggered.
Management has also concluded that there was no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions used in testing goodwill for impairment that would have caused an impairment to be recognised.
Overall, as at 31 December 2016, based on internal valuations, management has concluded that the recoverable value of the Groups CGUs exceeded their carrying amount.
In addition, following the reduction in contingent consideration payable on the acquisition of Rokstad and Outland arising from lower expectations for EBITDA performance in the short-term see note 29 together with the impact of the prolonged low oil price on the performance of Bouchier, management undertook a detailed review of the recoverability of the goodwill arising from these acquisitions, which form part of the Canada services CGU.
The review included sensitivity analysis involving reductions to expected future cash flows of 25 per cent and an increase in the discount rate of 50 per cent.
On the basis of the detailed review undertaken, management concluded that there was no impairment to the carrying amount of goodwill within the Canada services CGU.

In December 2014, the Group issued 170 million of unsecured convertible bonds maturing by December 2019 with a coupon of 2.5 per cent payable semi-annually in arrears.
The initial conversion price has been set at 398.56 pence and upon conversion Carillion may elect to settle its obligations by way of delivery of ordinary shares, payment of a cash alternative amount or a combination of the two.
At inception, the proceeds from the convertible bond comprised a derivative liability component of 13.4 million and a debt component of 156.6 million.
The derivative liability component represents the fair value of the embedded option to convert the bond into ordinary shares of the Company or to settle in cash and is calculated using a Black-Scholes or similar bespoke model.
The fair value of the debt component is calculated as the difference between the proceeds from the issue and the fair value of the embedded derivative component.
The debt component at 31 December 2016 amounted to 162.2 million and included 5.6 million of interest accretion.
Bank loans and overdrafts are largely unsecured and bear interest at floating rates linked to the London Interbank Offered Rate, the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate or the Emirates Interbank Offered Rate.

Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 117 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 23.
Reserves continued Merger reserve The merger reserve initially arose on the demerger from Tarmac plc on 29 July 1999.
The reserve increased on the acquisition of Mowlem on 23 February 2006, Alfred McAlpine on 12 February 2008 and Carillion Energy Services on 21 April 2011, whereby the consideration included the issue of Carillion plc shares.
The premium on the shares issued in relation to these acquisitions has been credited to the merger reserve rather than the share premium account in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The 4.7 million 2015: 7.2 million transfer to the retained earnings reserve during the year represents the amounts realised following the amortisation of intangible assets recognised on the Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine acquisitions.
Retained earnings Retained earnings include the reserve for the Companys own shares which comprises of the cost of the Companys shares held by the Carillion Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP.
The shares held by the ESOP may subsequently be awarded to employees under the Groups share incentive schemes.
The movement in the reserve for own shares included within retained earnings are as follows: 2016 2015 m m At 1 January Acquisition of own shares 1.0 0.4 Share options exercised transfer to retained earnings 1.0 0.4 At 31 December At 31 December 2016, the ESOP held 18,538 2015: 6,578 of the Companys shares which had a market value of 43,713 2015: 19,925.
During the year the Company acquired 338,617 of its own shares for 1.0 million to meet the plans commitments.
The ESOP has elected to waive all dividends except for a total payment of 1 pence at the time each dividend is paid.
The Company has also established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST.
At 31 December 2016 the total number of shares held by the QUEST amounted to 84,593 2015: 84,593 which had a market value of 0.2 million 2015: 0.3 million.
The QUEST has elected to waive all dividends in excess of 0.01 pence per share.
The retained earnings reserve includes the credit transferred from the merger reserve of 4.7 million 2015: 7.2 million noted above.
Share-based payments The Group has established a share option programme that entitles Executive Directors and senior employees to shares in the Company.
Full details of the Groups share option schemes can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 65 to 81.
In addition, under the terms of the Groups bonus arrangements, Executive Directors and senior employees receive a proportion of their annual bonus in shares, which vest three years after the award in respect of Executive Directors and a year after the award in respect of senior employees.

The Group treats guarantees and counter indemnities of this nature as contingent liabilities until such time as it becomes probable that the Group will be required to make a payment under the terms of the arrangement.
Claims under contracts and other agreements, including joint arrangements, are outstanding in the normal course of business.
The Group, in the normal course of its activities, is the subject of certain legal proceedings.
The resolution of these proceedings is regarded as unlikely to succeed or to have a material effect on the Groups financial position.
There are no liabilities of joint ventures for which the Group is contingently liable other than those disclosed above.

Financial instruments continued Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policy is to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to financial risk or the manner in which these risks are managed and measured.
The Groups treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board of Directors.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Foreign currency risk The Group has operations in overseas regions, primarily the Middle East and Canada.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet from the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility, the Groups policy is that foreign currency denominated net assets that exceed 10 million equivalent are hedged, as a minimum, to at least 60 per cent of the net asset value.
Net investment hedging of overseas operations is achieved through borrowing and forward contracts denominated in the relevant foreign currencies, or where this is not practicable, in a currency which the relevant currency closely follows.
The Group has US$280 million of private placement finance at fixed interest rates from a number of United States of America based investors in order to provide greater flexibility in relation to the maturity profile of Group borrowing.
The Group has entered into a number of financial derivative contracts to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility in relation to the associated capital and interest payments.
Group policy is to recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of hedges in equity and to recognise ineffective portions immediately in the income statement.
Profits arising within overseas operations are not hedged unless a distribution is planned.
Such distributions are then treated as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
The Group has relatively small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures.
Any individual exposures that are significant are hedged using forward contracts or other appropriate risk management techniques.
Further details concerning the risks associated with the overseas regions in which the Group operates can be found in the Performance and financial review on page 46.
Foreign currency exposure The carrying amount of the Groups borrowing denominated in foreign currency is as follows: 2016 2015 m m United States of America dollar 246.0 207.6 Canadian dollar 97.0 65.3 United Arab Emirates dirham 9.9 8.3 Other 0.4 2.5 353.3 283.7 Of the total foreign currency borrowing of 353.3 million 2015: 283.7 million, the amount of borrowing used for hedging overseas currency net asset amounts to 89.4 million 2015: 73.4 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 16.0 million 2015: 4.9 million gain on translation of the borrowing into sterling has been recognised in the translation reserve as these hedging loans are effective hedges.
Exposure to United States of America dollar denominated private placement borrowing included above amounting to 225.8 million 2015: 190.5 million is hedged by cross-currency derivative instruments as disclosed on page 124.
The Group does not have a significant amount of foreign currency exposure in respect of financial assets.
Each movement of five per cent in exchange rates against sterling would have changed reported profit before tax and equity as follows: Five per cent increase Five per cent decrease Profit Equity Profit Equity m m m m United States of America dollar 1.0 1.1 Canadian dollar 0.4 11.0 0.4 11.7 Euro 1.1 1.2 United Arab Emirates dirham 0.5 5.3 0.5 5.6 Oman rials 0.2 3.0 0.2 3.2 Other 0.1 1.3 0.1 1.4 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 121 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 26.
Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Groups interest bearing debt is predominantly drawn from committed bank facilities to fund acquisitions and ongoing working capital requirements.
Foreign currency denominated borrowings have been drawn under the facilities to hedge net assets of overseas operations.
Such borrowing is subject to floating rates of interest linked to London Interbank Offered Rate, the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate or the Emirates Interbank Offered Rate.
In addition, the Group has secured fixed interest rate finance of 360.8 million from private placements and 170 million from the issue of convertible bonds as disclosed in note 19.
The principal purpose of raising this finance at fixed interest rates is to ensure that a proportion of the Groups borrowing is not subject to floating rates of interest which may increase.
The fixed rate interest swap, which swapped the floating rate to a fixed rate on 38 million of the Groups principal bank facilities matured in 2016 and has not been replaced.
In addition, a number of Groups Public Private Partnership joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps as discussed under derivative financial instruments on page 124.
A one percentage point rise in interest rates in respect of United States of America dollar denominated borrowings would increase the annual net interest charge by approximately 0.2 million, in respect of Canadian dollar denominated borrowings an increase of 0.5 million, in respect of sterling denominated borrowings an increase of 3.4 million and in respect of United Arab Emirates Dirham denominated borrowings an increase of 0.1 million.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of a syndicated loan facility and bilateral facilities supplemented by private placement financing, convertible bonds and short-term overdraft facilities.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
The average net borrowing during 2016 was 586.5 million 2015: 538.9 million.

Financial instruments continued Borrowing facilities The Group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at the year end in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met: 2016 2015 m m Expiring within one year 5.2 7.2 Expiring between two and five years 726.4 754.0 731.6 761.2 Credit risk Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging contracts.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated, authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are approved at main Board level or within predetermined limits.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at 31 December by geographic region was: 1 2016 2015 m m United Kingdom 85.5 127.2 Middle East 78.7 77.3 Canada 65.2 48.4 Rest of the World 0.1 0.2 229.5 253.1 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at 31 December by segment was: 1 2016 2015 m m Support services 120.3 140.8 Public Private Partnership projects 0.1 0.5 Middle East construction services 76.9 76.2 Construction services excluding the Middle East 32.2 35.6 229.5 253.1 The Groups most significant debtor, Pretium Exploration Inc, accounts for 8.8 million of the trade receivables carrying amount at 31 December 2016 2015: Network Rail: 5.6 million.
Trade receivables included in the balance sheet are net of an impairment provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the impairment provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
The ageing of trade receivables is as follows: 2016 2015 Net trade Net trade 2 1 2 receivables Impairment receivables Impairment m m m m Not past due 134.8 178.2 Past due less than three months 40.0 0.3 49.5 0.3 Past due between three and six months 28.0 0.6 11.7 1.5 Past due between six and 12 months 21.9 1.5 8.7 0.5 Past due more than 12 months 4.8 4.7 5.0 4.9 229.5 7.1 253.1 7.2 1 Restated for the retrospective adjustment to provisional amounts recognised on acquisitions in 2015.

Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.

A 35.1 million gain 2015: 15.6 million gain has been recognised in the hedging reserve in relation to the forward foreign currency contracts, fixed rate interest derivatives and cross-currency derivatives which are effective cash flow hedges, with 35.3 million recycled to administration expenses in the income statement to offset the foreign exchange loss on translation of the US dollar denominated private placement loans.
A 3.1 million loss 2015: 1.6 million gain has been recognised in the translation reserve in relation to the movement in forward foreign currency contracts utilised as net investment hedges of the net assets of overseas operations.
In addition to the above, a number of the Groups Public Private Partnership PPP joint ventures have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest bearing debts and the associated interest rate derivatives within these PPP joint ventures are without recourse to the Group.
The life of these hedge arrangements track PPP contract terms and hedge future movements across a range up until March 2047.
The fair value of these derivatives is based on quoted prices in active markets, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the share of change in fair value of effective cash flow hedges within joint ventures in the statement of comprehensive income.
At 31 December 2016 the Groups share of the total net fair value liability of interest rate derivatives in PPP joint ventures amounted to 7.9 million 2015: 0.7 million of which 1.1 million 2015: Nil has been recognised in the hedging reserve in 2016.
Fair values Financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet are non-quoted equity shareholdings within non-current asset investments, derivative financial instruments and contingent consideration payable in respect of acquisitions as disclosed in note 29.
Level 3 The fair value of non-current asset investments and contingent consideration payable is determined based on a level 3 valuation method, using valuation techniques that include inputs which are not based on market data.
The fair value of non-current asset investments is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows using asset specific discount rates, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the fair value movement on available-for-sale assets in the statement of comprehensive income.
The fair value of contingent consideration payable is calculated by discounting the maximum contractual cash flows that could be paid under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The movement in the fair value of financial instruments derived using a level 3 valuation method is shown below: Non-current Contingent asset consideration investments m m 1 At 1 January 2016 64.0 4.7 Remeasurements recognised in financial expense 15.6 Fair value of equity interests retained on partial disposal of investment in joint ventures 0.5 Discount unwind recognised in financial expense 2.6 Exchange rate movements recognised in the translation reserve 12.7 Increase in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 0.2 Transfer from current liabilities 3.7 At 31 December 2016 67.4 5.4 1 Restated for the retrospective adjustment to provisional amounts recognised on acquisitions in 2015.
The fair value of non-current asset investments is most sensitive to movements in the discount rate used.
A one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the fair value by 0.4 million.
In respect of contingent consideration, a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the fair value of the liability by 1.7 million.
Level 2 The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on a level 2 valuation method, using inputs from quoted prices in active markets, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement or the hedging reserve as appropriate.
There are no material differences between the fair value and the carrying value of the Groups other financial assets and financial liabilities.

Financial instruments continued Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal debt and equity structure.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of the dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Where the Group makes significant acquisitions, these are financed with a combination of debt and equity in order to maintain a balanced capital structure.
In order to have greater flexibility over the maturity profile of debt, the Group has secured 360.8 million of private placement financing with maturity dates between 2017 and 2024 and 170 million of convertible bonds that mature in 2019.
The Group has a policy of progressively increasing dividends paid to shareholders broadly in line with underlying earnings per share growth, after taking account of the investment needs of the business.
No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015.

Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions in 2016 and 2017 There were no acquisitions in 2016.
However, on 1 January 2017, the Group acquired the entire share capital of a Canadian facilities management services business from a subsidiary of Compass Group Canada Limited.
The total cash consideration, which is capped at approximately 24 million, is payable in instalments and is subject to adjustment based on the financial performance of the business.
For its 2015 financial year, the business had annual revenue of 70 million and the business combination accounting and post-acquisition results of the business will be incorporated within the Groups 2017 financial statements.
The acquisition of the business does not have a material impact on the balance sheet of the Group and therefore the disclosures required by International Financial Reporting Standard 3 Business combinations have not been presented.
Total acquisition costs incurred in relation to contracts and due diligence procedures for merger and acquisition activities in the year of 1.1 million 2015: 2.5 million have been included in non-operating items in the income statement see note 4.
Acquisitions in 2015 and 2014 On 28 May 2015, the Group acquired the entire share capital of the Outland Group Outland.
Outland provides a complete range of remote site services across a number of growth sectors in Canada, including mining, utilities, forestry, gas and oil.
The total cash consideration, which is capped at approximately 63 million, is dependent on the financial performance of Outland between 2015 and 2017.
The first instalment of the consideration of 10.7 million was included in the cash flow statement for 2015 within acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired.
The fair value of the deferred and contingent consideration is included within liabilities in the balance sheet and is derived from inputs that are not observable in the market.
Consequently, the fair value has been determined using an estimate of the contractual cash flows that could be paid under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement using a risk adjusted discount rate of 3.4 per cent.
In the first six months of 2016, the provisional assessment of the fair value of the net assets acquired and the contingent consideration payable relating to the acquisition of Outland became final following finalisation of the completion accounts process.
As a result, the provisional amounts were amended giving rise to revised goodwill on the acquisition of 37.3 million, with prior year comparatives restated as noted below.
Under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement relating to Outland, contingent consideration is payable based on a multiple of Outlands average earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA for the three financial years 2015 to 2017.
During the measurement period in the first half of 2016, Outlands actual EBITDA performance for 2015 was finalised, leading to a reduction in the fair value of the contingent consideration payable of 5.4 million, as disclosed in the table below.
In the second half of 2016, which is outside of the measurement period, the Group undertook a review of Outlands expected EBITDA performance for 2016 and 2017, leading to a reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration payable of 8.4 million, which has been recognised as a credit within net financial expense in the income statement.
Following this change to the fair value of contingent consideration, the Group now expects to make contingent consideration payments totalling around 19.9 million at 31 December 2016 exchange rates in equal instalments in 2018 and 2019.
In 2016, the Group paid the second and third instalment of deferred consideration relating to the acquisition of Outland amounting to 26.7 million.
On 24 December 2015, the Group acquired a 67 per cent controlling interest in Ask Real Estate Limited AREL, a property development company based in the United Kingdom.
The cash consideration of 4.0 million was paid in January 2016.
Under the terms of the shareholders agreement, Carillion has undertaken to acquire the remaining 33 per cent shareholding after a minimum period of five years from the date of the acquisition.
The fair value of the commitment to purchase the remaining 33 per cent shareholding of 5.4 million has been included in the fair value of the consideration relating to the acquisition, with non-controlling interests derecognised.
Following other measurement period adjustments, revised goodwill arising on the acquisition amounted to 6.1 million.
As the adjustments to the provisional amounts recognised in 2015 relating to the acquisition of Outland and AREL are within the measurement period, prior year comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2015 have been restated as indicated below: Outland AREL Total m m m Provisional goodwill 43.1 43.1 Amendments to property, plant and equipment 0.3 0.3 Amendments to investments in joint ventures 0.9 0.9 Amendments to trade and other receivables 0.3 0.3 Amendments to trade and other payables 0.5 0.5 Amendments to contingent consideration 5.4 5.4 Exchange rate movements 0.4 0.4 Amendments to non-controlling interests 0.7 0.7 Revised goodwill 37.3 6.1 43.4 The above acquisitions do not have a material impact on the balance sheet of the Group and therefore the full disclosures required by International Financial Reporting Standard 3 Business combinations have not been presented.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 127 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 29.
Acquisitions and disposals continued In the first six months of 2016, the Group reviewed its obligations in respect of contingent consideration payable arising on the acquisition of the Rokstad Corporation Rokstad in December 2014.
Under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement relating to Rokstad, contingent consideration is payable based on a multiple of Rokstads EBITDA for 2015 and 2016.
During this period, Rokstads actual EBITDA performance for 2015 was finalised and a revised estimate was made of the expected EBITDA outturn for 2016, leading to a reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration payable of 7.2 million.
This change in the fair value of contingent consideration has been recognised as a credit within net financial expense in the income statement.
As a result of this reduction, the Group now expects to make consideration payments totalling around 3.7 million at 31 December 2016 exchange rates in 2017.
In 2016, the Group paid 1.8 million to the previous owners of Rokstad under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement.
The estimate of Rokstads EBITDA for 2019, upon which the consideration for the acquisition of the remaining 40 per cent of the issued share capital is based, remains unchanged.
Cash flows associated with the acquisition of subsidiaries included in the cash flow statement are analysed below: 2016 2015 m m Cash paid for acquisitions in the year 10.7 Net cash and cash equivalents acquired 6.2 Payments in respect of acquisitions in prior years see above and page 127 32.5 6.1 Net cash outflow on acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired 32.5 10.6 In 2016, the Group disposed of its interest in three Public Private Partnership projects.
The disposals generated cash consideration of 48.2 million, which after deducting disposal costs paid of 1.1 million, is included in the cash flow statement within disposal of joint venture and other investments.
The profit recognised on the disposals in the income statement of 12.7 million is after the deduction of accrued costs of 0.2 million and the carrying amount of joint ventures disposed totalling 35.3 million as disclosed in note 12.
Disposals in 2015 In 2015, the Group disposed of its interest in three Public Private Partnership projects.
The disposals generated cash consideration of 54.4 million, which after deducting disposal costs paid of 0.3 million, is included in the cash flow statement within disposal of joint venture and other investments.
Additional consent costs paid of 10.1 million relating to the disposals have been included within decrease increase in trade and other payables of 41.1 million within the operating cash flow section of the cash flow statement and legal costs of 0.9 million have been accrued for.
The profit recognised on the disposals in the income statement of 37.7 million is after the deduction of the accrued costs above and the carrying amount of joint ventures disposed totalling 5.4 million as disclosed in note 12.
Retirement benefit obligations The Carillion Group operates 14 defined benefit pension schemes for eligible employees, of which 13 are in the UK and one is in Canada.
In addition, the Group provides other post-retirement benefits under four separate arrangements in Canada.
In line with IAS 19 the Company has considered whether it is appropriate to provide disaggregated disclosures for the 14 defined benefit pension schemes.
Five plans relate to UK-based final salary schemes which are all closed to future accrual, share broadly common membership demographics and are operated under a single trust arrangement.
Therefore the Company has taken the view that these five schemes should be considered together as one.
Asthese five plans account for 83.2% 669.8 million of the total deficit across all schemes as at 31 December 2016, the Company has not disaggregated the remaining plans individually and has instead provided disaggregated data in the form of closed, open and unfunded schemes.
The Groups defined benefit schemes are administered by Trustee Boards which largely comprise independent trustees together with Company and employee representatives.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from the Companys assets and are managed by the Trustee Boards.
Pension scheme valuations are carried out by independent actuaries to determine pension costs for pension funding every three years and bi-annually to calculate the IAS 19 deficit included in the financial statements.
Eight of the 14 defined benefit schemes within the Group are closed to future accrual, with payments into these schemes made in line with deficit recovery plans, which have been agreed with pension scheme trustees.
The different scheme characteristics can be summarised below: 2016 2015 Assets Obligations Total Assets Obligations Total m m m m m m Schemes closed to future accrual 1,926.8 2,615.0 688.2 1,747.9 2,076.0 328.1 Open schemes 645.9 750.8 104.9 554.5 610.2 55.7 1 Unfunded schemes 11.7 11.7 9.7 9.7 Total 2,572.7 3,377.5 804.8 2,302.4 2,695.9 393.5 1 Unfunded schemes relate to other post-retirement benefits under four separate arrangements in Canada.
The Group also operates defined contribution schemes for all qualifying employees.
The total cost charged to the income statement of 25.0 million 2015: 21.1 million represents contributions payable to the schemes by the Group at rates specified by the scheme rules.

Retirement benefit obligations continued IAS 19 disclosures The weighted average of the principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in providing the IAS 19 position were: 2016 2015 UK Canada UK Canada Rate of increase in salaries 3.20% N A 3.55% N A Rate of increase in pensions 3.10% 2.00% 3.00% 2.00% Inflation rate Retail Price Index 3.20% 2.00% 3.05% 2.00% Inflation rate Consumer Price Index 2.15% N A 2.00% N A Discount rate 2.70% 3.75% 3.95% 3.75% The valuation of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities is most sensitive to changes in the discount, inflation and mortality rates.
A 0.1 per cent reduction in the discount rate would increase scheme liabilities by approximately 60 million, whilst a 0.1 per cent increase in the inflation rate would increase scheme liabilities by approximately 50 million.
An increase of one year in the mortality rate would increase scheme liabilities by approximately 105 million, although this has been mitigated in part through the purchase of a longevity swap.
The overall weighted average duration of scheme liabilities as at 31 December 2016 is approximately 18 years.
Over the next five years benefits of 580 million are expected to be paid and benefits of 674 million are expected to be paid over the subsequent five-year period.
The market values of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present values of the schemes liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on Grade AA corporate bonds.
The assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.

The triennial actuarial valuations as at 31 December 2013 for five of the Groups schemes were concluded with the trustees in 2014 and a revised deficit recovery plan agreed.
It has been agreed that, if required, deficit recovery payments can continue until 2029 in respect of these schemes.
This included the three largest schemes in the Group, namely the Carillion Staff, Mowlem Staff and Alfred McAlpine Staff schemes.
The total assets at the date of the actuarial valuation for all five schemes amounted to 1.8 billion, which represented a funding level of 76 per cent.
The next actuarial valuation for these schemes as at 31 December 2016 is currently underway.
The Group expects to make payments totalling 50.2 million to defined benefit schemes during the next financial year.
During 2013, a longevity swap was entered into by five of the Groups defined benefit schemes which insures the Group against the financial risk of pensioners in payment living longer than currently expected.
The swap covers around 9,000 pensioners and around 40 per cent of the total liabilities in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
The swap has been recognised as part of scheme assets in accordance with the amendment to IAS 19 Retirement benefits within other assets.
At 31 December 2016, the fair value of the longevity swap calculated in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair value measurement was a 26.9 million liability 2015: 1.4 million liability, with the movement in fair value recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

In respect of revenue derived from licensing, the income earned from such transactions is included in revenue as disclosed in note 2, as the exploitation of the Groups intellectual property is regarded by management as being part of its ordinary activities, having completed a similar licensing agreement in 2013.
The licensing agreement secured in 2016 was entered into at or around the same time and with the same counterparty to a series of contracts that extended the scope of the services provided by the Groups back-office outsourcing provider as described in the Strategic report on page 39.
Management considered whether the transactions should be grouped together for the purposes of determining whether the revenue should be recognised immediately under the licensing agreement or recognised over the term of the outsourcing contract.
Management concluded that the transactions should be recognised independently and in their own right.
This judgement was made after undertaking a benchmarking review that indicated that the contracts relating to the extension in scope of the outsourced back-office services were at fair market value and were therefore not linked to the licensing agreement.
Consequently, as there were also no continuing support obligations required to be provided by the Group under the licensing agreement, the licensing revenue has been recognised immediately.
