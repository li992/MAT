ACCOUNTS AND OTHER INFORMATION NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
General information Wizz Air Holdings plc the Company is a public company incorporated in Jersey under the address 44 The Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey JE4 9WG.
The Company is managed from Switzerland.
The Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group or Wizz Air provide low-cost, low-fare passenger air transportation services on scheduled short-haul and medium-haul point-to-point routes across Europe and the Middle East.
Accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the presentation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs and IFRS IC interpretations.
Based on the exemption provided in Article 105 11 of the Companies Jersey Law 1991 the Company does not present its individual financial statements and related notes.
The financial statements are presented in Euros which is the functional currency of all companies in the Group with the exception of Dnieper Aviation LLC and Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC for which the functional currency is the Ukrainian Hryvnia national currency of Ukraine.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, and financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS legislates the use of certain critical accounting estimates and requires management to exercise judgements in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies.
The areas involving a high degree of judgement or complexity, on areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.
New standards and interpretations a Standards, amendments and interpretations effective and adopted by the Group The following new IFRSs and amendments are mandatory for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 and have therefore been adopted by the Group as of 1 April 2015.
E Amendment to IFRS 2, Share-based payment clarifies the definition of vesting condition and now distinguishes between performance condition and service condition.
E Amendment to IFRS 3, Business combinations clarifies that an obligation to pay contingent consideration is classified as financial liability or equity under the principles in IAS 32 and that all non-equity contingent consideration financial and non-financial is measured at fair value at each reporting date.
It is also clarified that IFRS 3 does not apply to the accounting for the formation of any joint arrangement.
E Amendment to IFRS 8, Operating segments requires disclosure of the judgements made by management in aggregating operating segments and clarifies that a reconciliation of segment assets must only be disclosed if segment assets are reported.
E Amendment to IFRS 13, Fair value measurement confirms that short-term receivables and payables can continue to be measured at invoice amounts if the impact of discounting is immaterial.
It also clarifies that the portfolio exception in IFRS 13 measuring the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on a net basis applies to all contracts within the scope of IAS 39 or IFRS 9.
E Amendment to IAS 16, Property, plant and equipment and IAS 38, Intangible assets clarifies how the gross carrying amount and accumulated depreciation are treated where an entity measures its assets at revalued amounts.
E Amendment to IAS 24, Related party disclosures where an entity receives management personnel services from a third party a management entity, the fees paid for those services must be disclosed by the reporting entity, but not the compensation paid by the management entity to its employees or directors.

Accounting policies continued New standards and interpretations continued a Standards, amendments and interpretations effective and adopted by the Group continued E Amendment to IAS 40, Investment property clarifies that IAS 40 and IFRS 3 are not mutually exclusive when distinguishing between investment property and owner-occupied property and determining whether the acquisition of an investment property is a business combination.
E Amendment to IAS 19, Employee benefits - clarifies the accounting for defined benefit plans that require employees or third parties to contribute towards the cost of the benefits.
Under the previous version of IAS 19, most entities deducted the contributions from the cost of the benefits earned in the year the contributions were paid.
However, the treatment under the 2011 revised standard was not so clear.
It could be quite complex to apply, as it requires an estimation of the future contributions receivable and an allocation over future service periods.
To provide relief, changes were made to IAS 19.
These allow contributions that are linked to service, but that do not vary with the length of employee service e. g. a fixed per cent of salary, to be deducted from the cost of benefits earned in the period that the service is provided.
Therefore many entities will be able to but not be required continue accounting for employee contributions using their existing accounting policy.
The Group anticipates that the adoption of the above standards will not have a material effect on its results or financial position.
b Standards early adopted by the Group There are no standards early adopted by the Group.
c Interpretations and standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group E IFRS 9, Financial instrumentsaddresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.
The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014.
It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or expense and fair value through profit or loss.
IFRS 9 allows changes in the time value of options to be recognised in other comprehensive income, as opposed to the statement of comprehensive income under IAS 39.
For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss.
IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests.
It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the hedged ratio to be the same as the one management actually uses for risk management purposes.
Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39.
The standard has not been adopted by the European Union, but is expected to be effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with early adoption permitted.
E IFRS 14, Regulatory deferral accounts effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016 specifies the financial reporting requirements for regulatory deferral account balances that arise when an entity provides goods or services to customers at a price or rate that is subject to rate regulation.
E IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers.
Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service.
The standard replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction contracts and related interpretations.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and earlier application is permitted subject to EU endorsement.
E IFRS 16, Leases effective for the accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of leases with the objective of ensuring that lessees and lessors provide relevant information that faithfully represents those transactions.
The standard supersedes IAS 17 Leases and is subject to EU endorsement.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods except that i IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments: ii IFRS 15 may have an impact on revenue recognition and related disclosures: and iii IFRS 16 will require all lease contracts of the Group to be recognised on the balance sheet, as well as significant new, enhanced disclosures.
At this stage the Directors are not able to estimate the impact of the new rules on the Groups financial statements.
The Group will make more detailed assessment of the impact of these standards over the next twelve months.

Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are all entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The results of all the subsidiaries are consolidated up to 31 March which is the financial year end of the Company.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Going concern The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the Group will continue in business for the foreseeable future.
This assumption is based on the Directors assessment of the Groups financial performance and position to date, together with a review of its forecasts, in light of the risks to which the Group is exposed.
Foreign currency The Groups presentational currency is the Euro.
The functional currency of all the Group entities with the exception of Dnieper Aviation LLC and Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC is the Euro.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the statement of financial position date are translated into Euros at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as financial income or expense.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and which are recognised at their historical cost are translated into Euros at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and which are stated at fair value are translated into Euros at exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The functional currency of Dnieper Aviation LLC and Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC is the Ukrainian Hryvnia UAH.
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentational currency are translated into the presentational currency as follows: E assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that statement of financial position: E income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive income are translated at monthly average exchange rates unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions : and E all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity cumulative translation adjustments.
The below exchange rates were used for the translation in the respective financial years: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2016 2015 UAH EUR UAH EUR Closing rate 29.69 25.45 Average rate for the year 29.26 25.12 Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2016 79 ACCOUNTS AND OTHER INFORMATION NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Accounting policies continued Financial assets and liabilities The Group classifies its financial assets and liabilities in line with IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement into the following categories: Description in the statement of financial position Category Non-current assets Restricted cash Loans and receivables Trade and other receivables Loans and receivables Current assets Trade and other receivables Loans and receivables Financial assets available for sale Available-for-sale assets Derivative financial instruments Fair value through profit or loss Restricted cash Loans and receivables Cash and cash equivalents Loans and receivables Non-current liabilities Borrowings Other financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Convertible debts Other financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Current liabilities Trade and other payables Other financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Borrowings Other financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Convertible debt Other financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Derivative financial instruments Fair value through profit or loss The classification of financial assets depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
a Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading.
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term.
Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
Derivatives assets or liabilities are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.
b Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the statement of financial position date, that are classified as non-current assets.
The Groups loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash in the statement of financial position.
c Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within twelve months of the statement of financial position date.
Available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value.
d Other financial liabilities measured at amortised costs Other financial liabilities are non-derivative financial liabilities with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current liabilities, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the statement of financial position date that are classified as non-current liabilities.
The Groups other financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and interest-bearing loans and borrowings including convertible debt in the statement of financial position.
The Group invests excess cash in a conservative way, primarily in short-term time deposits and money market funds.
Management does not, in the short term, plan to have held-to-maturity investments.
The recognition and measurement criteria are described in the relevant accounting policy section.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2016 80 ACCOUNTS AND OTHER INFORMATION NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Accounting policies continued Financial assets and liabilities continued Derivative financial instruments and hedging Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income, within financial income or expenses.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged see below.
The Group enters into foreign exchange and jet fuel price hedging transactions to minimise the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and fuel price on the Group.
Both types of hedging transactions are cash flow hedges under IAS 39.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any unrealised gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve within other comprehensive income.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income as financial income or expenses.
The associated cumulative gain or loss on the effective part is removed from other comprehensive income and recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the respective operating expense line s in the same period or periods as the hedged forecast transaction.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the hedged transaction is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income immediately, net of tax, within the cash flow hedging reserve.
Before expiry, the fair value of an option comprises i its intrinsic value, being a function of the difference between contracted and market or spot prices: and ii its time value, being the difference of the fair value and the intrinsic value at any point in time.
Subject to hedge effectiveness, any increase or decrease in the intrinsic value of the hedging instrument is taken to equity within other comprehensive income or expense.
However, any increase or decrease in the time value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income as financial income or expense.
This reflects the fact that variations in the time value of an option are required to be excluded from the hedge relationship in accordance with IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
Accordingly: E initial recognition: the open position on the derivative hedging instrument is recorded as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position at fair value: E subsequent remeasurement of unexpired options: i the effective portion of changes in the intrinsic element of the fair value is recorded in other comprehensive income, ii changes in the time value element of the fair value, or the ineffective portion, if any, are recorded as financial income or expense in the statement of comprehensive income: and E the realised gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recorded against the respective operating expense line s in the statement of comprehensive income.
The ineffective portion is determined in line with IAS 39, applying the 80125 per cent.
The ineffective part of changes in fair value, if any, is recorded as financial income or expense in the statement of comprehensive income.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2016 81 ACCOUNTS AND OTHER INFORMATION NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Accounting policies continued Financial assets and liabilities continued Derivative financial instruments and hedging continued Hedging with non-derivatives The Group uses its selected financial assets denominated US Dollar to hedge highly probable future expenses in US Dollar.
Starting from January 2016 the Group applies hedge accounting to part of its non-derivate financial assets, in the interest of reducing the amount of unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the periodic revaluation of these assets.
The accounting treatment of non-derivatives designated as hedging instruments is identical to cash flow hedges with derivatives, that is: E the unrealised gains or losses on hedging instruments are recorded as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position at fair value, and the effective portion of changes in the fair value is recorded in other comprehensive income: and E the realised gains or losses on the hedging instruments are recorded against the respective expense line s in the statement of comprehensive income.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less impairment losses.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the trade and other receivables account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income within other expenses.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against other expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.
Other receivables also comprise insurance claims related to events that are covered by insurance contracts.
The Group recognises the income in the financial statements only from those insurance claims which, based on managements judgment, are virtually certain to be received by the Group.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits repayable on demand or which mature within three months of inception, less any overdrafts repayable on demand.
Cash held in money market funds is also included in cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents do not include restricted cash.
Cash and cash equivalents are netted only when right of offset has been obtained.
Restricted cash Restricted cash represents cash deposits held by the banks that cover letters of credit, issued by the same bank, to certain suppliers.
Restricted cash is split between non-current and current assets depending on the maturity period of the underlying letters of credit.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Trade and other payables comprise balances payable to suppliers, authorities and employees.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a financial expense over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
Financial expenses include also withholding tax paid on the interest if according to the loan agreement the payment of withholding tax is the liability of the Group.
Convertible debt Convertible debt instruments that can be converted to share capital at the option of the holder, where the number of shares issued does not vary with changes in their fair value, are accounted for as compound instruments.
Transaction costs that relate to the issue of a compound instrument are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds.
The liability component is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option.
The equity component of the compound instrument is calculated as the excess of the issue proceeds over the value of the liability component.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2016 82 ACCOUNTS AND OTHER INFORMATION NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Accounting policies continued Financial assets and liabilities continued Classification of compound instruments issued by the Group Compound instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity i. e. forming part of Shareholders funds only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: a they include no contractual obligations upon the Company or Group as the case may be to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company or Group : and b where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or it is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Where a compound instrument that contains both equity and financial liability components exists these components are separated by recognising the liability at fair value and accounted for individually under the above policy.
The finance cost on the financial liability component is correspondingly higher over the life of the instrument.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses.
Finance payments associated with compound instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
Impairment of financial assets Impairment losses are recognised on financial assets carried at amortised cost where there is objective evidence that a loss has been incurred.
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
If, subsequently, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event that occurred after the impairment was recognised, the appropriate portion of the loss is reversed.
Both impairment losses and reversals are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as components of financial income or expenses, except in the case of impairment of available-for-sale financial assets where the impairment and its reversal may be charged to other comprehensive income under certain circumstances.
Current trade and other receivables are discounted where the effect is material.
Non-financial assets and liabilities Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis to write off cost to residual value over the estimated useful economic lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
In the case of certain aircraft maintenance assets, the useful economic life of the asset can be defined in terms of flight hours or flight cycles, and in this case the depreciation charge is determined based on the actual number of flight hours or flight cycles.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Land and buildings three to five years, being the shorter of useful economic life and the lease term Aircraft maintenance assets two to seven years, being the shorter of useful economic life and the lease term Aircraft parts seven years Fixtures and fittings three years The residual values and useful lives are re-assessed annually.

Accounting policies continued Non-financial assets and liabilities continued Assets received free of charge In certain cases the Group receives assets free of charge.
These are treated as non-cash items in the statement of cash flows.
Advances paid for aircraft pre-delivery payments PDP Pre-delivery payments PDP are paid by the Group to aircraft and engine manufacturers for financing the production of the ordered aircraft or spare engine as determined by the contractual terms.
Such advance payments for aircraft or spare engines are recognised at cost and classified as property, plant and equipment in the statement of financial position.
The amount is not depreciated.
The Group may enter into sale and leaseback arrangements with lessors to finance future aircraft or spare engine deliveries.
These arrangements are structured such that the right and the commitment to purchase the aircraft or spare engine are assigned to the lessor only on the date of delivery a delivery date assignment : as such, the recognition and classification of the PDP balance does not change when the sale and leaseback contracts are signed.
On the delivery of the aircraft or spare engine the lessor pays the full purchase price of the asset to the manufacturer and the Group receives from the manufacturer a refund of the PDPs paid.
At this moment the fixed asset is fide-recognised from the statement of financial position and any gain or loss arising is transferred to the statement of comprehensive income as an operating income or expense.
In some instances PDPs are paid in the name of the Group by the lessors directly to the aircraft manufacturer.
These PDPs are also recognised by the Group in the statement of financial position as advances paid for aircraft and as received loans until the delivery of the aircraft.
In the statement of cash flows these PDPs and loans are treated as non-cash items and are eliminated both from advances paid for aircrafts refund of advances paid for aircraft and commercial loan lines.
Advances paid for aircraft maintenance assets FHA Advances paid for aircraft maintenance assets represent advance payments made in relation to heavy maintenance scheduled to be performed in the future for the definition of heavy maintenance see the accounting policy section on maintenance.
Such advance payments are made by the Group particularly to the engine maintenance service provider under fleet hour agreements FHA.
The balance of such assets is re-categorised into aircraft maintenance assets at the time when the aircraft maintenance asset is recognised in respect of the same component and the same heavy maintenance event.
This is when the component no longer meets the conditions set out in the lease agreement.
Advances paid for aircraft maintenance are not depreciated.
In the statement of cash flows the FHA payments are shown under the purchase of maintenance assets line together with other aircraft maintenance asset purchases.
Intangible assets Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Web development costs are capitalised to the extent they are expected to generate future economic benefits and meet the other criteria described in IAS 38 Intangible assets.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Amortisation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets.
Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Software licences three to eight years Web and other software development costs three to five years Inventories Inventories mainly spares are purchased for internal use and are stated at cost unless impaired or at net realisable value if any items are to be sold or scrapped.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of the business less the estimated selling expense.
Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.

Accounting policies continued Non-financial assets and liabilities continued Emissions Trading Scheme As of January 1, 2012 the scope of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme 2008 101 EC EU ETS covers airlines.
The Group is required to formally report its annual emissions to the relevant authorities and surrender emission allowances EUAs equivalent to the emission made during the year.
Surrendered allowances are a combination of the free allowances granted by the authorities and allowances purchased by the Group from other parties.
The Group follows the cost method of booking the allowances: the free allowances have nilcost value so therefore are not recognised as an asset: allowances purchased in the market are recorded at the purchase price in inventory.
The Group is given free allowances by the competent authorities, and the net economic impact to the Group is therefore represented by the shortfall between the actual carbon emitted and the free allowances given to the Group for that period.
The shortfall is recorded at forward prices as a cost.
Application of this accounting treatment means that the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of financial position reflect the net economic impact and are not grossed up to reflect the full obligation.
Deferred interest The Group enters into sale and leaseback agreements to finance future aircraft or spare engine deliveries.
In some cases it enters also into arrangements to finance the PDPs of such deliveries.
Interest accrued on loans to finance the PDPs on aircraft or spare engines is initially recognised under property plant and equipment advances paid for aircraft.
When the leased aircraft or spare engine is delivered, the PDP interest balance is reclassified within the statement of financial position from property, plant and equipment into deferred interest.
From this point forward the interest is amortised to the statement of comprehensive income during the term of the respective lease contract.
The Group recognises in the deferred interest line also the effect of the discounting adjustment of non-current receivables.
Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed at each statement of financial position date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Employee benefits Share based payment transactions The Group operates an equity-settled share option programme that allows Group employees to acquire shares in the Company.
The options are granted by the Company.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted at any measurement date so that the cumulative expense to date reflects the actual number of share options that are expected to vest.
The share award programme allows the Directors of the Company to acquire shares in the Company at nominal value.
The fair value of the awards granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which there are restrictions in place in respect of the transfer of the award shares by the Directors.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability please see further details of aircraft maintenance provisions in the accounting policy section on maintenance.

Accounting policies continued Revenue Revenue comprises the invoiced value of flight seats and ancillary revenues.
Passenger ticket revenue arises from the sale of flight seats and is recognised net of government taxes in the period in which the service is provided, that being when the airplane has departed.
Where charges levied by airports or government authorities on a per passenger basis represent a government tax in fact or in substance, then such amounts are presented on a net basis in the statement of comprehensive income netted between revenue and airport, handling and en-route charges lines.
Unearned revenue represents flight seats sold but not yet flown and is included in deferred income.
Refunds made to passengers are recorded as reductions in revenue.
Ancillary revenue arises from the sale of other services made by the Group and from commissions earned in relation to services sold on behalf of other parties.
Revenues from other services comprise mainly baggage charges, booking payment handling fees, airport check-in fees, fees for various convenience services priority boarding, extended legroom, reserved seat, loyalty programme membership fees, and hotel and other services sold by the tour operator unit of the Group.
Commission revenue arises in relation to the sale of onboard catering, accommodation, car rental, travel insurance, bus transfers, premium calls and co-branded credit cards.
Ancillary revenues are recognised as revenue on the date that the right to receive consideration occurs which is the date when the underlying service was provided.
This, depending on the type of service, might be either the date of sale, the date of flight or in the case of membership fees over the period of membership.
Leases Finance leases If the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are substantially transferred to Wizz Air then it is accounted for as a finance lease.
The Group analyses five criteria as follows: E transfer of ownership of the asset at the end of lease term: E option to purchase the asset at sufficiently below fair value: therefore, it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised: E major part of assets' economic life is at the lessee: E the asset is so special that it can be used only by the lessee: and E present value of minimum lease payments is substantially all of the fair value of the asset.
Management uses the above criteria as guidelines for its analyses: however, the substance of a transaction is always considered during the assessment.
Management assesses each leasing contract individually at initial recognition based on the above discussed criteria.
Finance leases are capitalised at the leases commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Operating leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Sale and leaseback transactions The Group enters into transactions whereby it assigns to a third party the right to acquire new aircraft or spare engines.
On delivery of the aircraft or spare engine, the Group will lease the aircraft or spare engine back through an operating lease from the same party.
Any gain arising on disposal, where the price that the aircraft is sold for is above fair value, is recognised initially in deferred income and then amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term of the asset.
Maintenance Aircraft maintenance provisions For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, the Group is contractually committed to either return the aircraft in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the aircraft and its major components upon return.
Provision is made for the minimum unavoidable costs of specific future obligations created by the lease at the time when such obligation becomes certain.
This is when the respective aircraft component no longer meets the lease re-delivery conditions.
The provision is used through the completion of a maintenance event such that the component again meets the re-delivery conditions.

Accounting policies continued Maintenance continued Aircraft maintenance assets Heavy maintenance relates to the overhaul of engines and associated components, the replacement of life limited parts, the replacement of landing gears and the non-routine airframe inspection and rectification works.
Under normal operating conditions heavy maintenance relates to work expected to be performed no more frequently than every two to four years.
The cost of heavy maintenance is capitalised and recognised as a tangible fixed asset and classified as aircraft maintenance assets at the earlier of a the time the lease re-delivery condition is no longer met see above under aircraft maintenance provisions or b when maintenance including enhancement is carried out.
Other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Such maintenance assets are depreciated over the period the Group benefits from the asset which is the shorter of a the estimated period until the next date when the lease re-delivery condition is no longer met or b the end of the assets operational life or c the end of the lease.
For engines and associated components, depreciation is charged on the basis of flight hours or cycles, while for other aircraft maintenance assets depreciation is charged evenly over the period the Group expects to derive benefit from the asset.
Components of newly leased aircraft such as life limited parts and engines are not accounted for as separate assets, and the inherent benefit of these assets which are utilised in the period from inception of the lease until the time the assets no longer meet the lease re-delivery condition is reflected in the payments made to the lessor over the life of the lease.
Aircraft maintenance assets are non-monetary items.
Non-Euro amounts are translated on inception to Euro and are not retranslated.
The recognition of aircraft maintenance assets against provisions for other liabilities and charges in the statement of financial position is a transaction not involving cash flows.
In the statement of cash flows the spending on these assets is presented as purchase of aircraft maintenance assets in the period when cash actually flows out of the Group.
This can happen either before or after the recognition of the asset, depending on the exact facts and circumstances associated with the relevant asset or assets.
Please refer also to the property, plant and equipment section of accounting policies.
Other receivables from lessors maintenance reserve Payments for aircraft and engine maintenance, as stipulated in the respective operating lease agreements, are made to the lessors as a security for the performance of future heavy maintenance works.
The payments are recorded as receivables from the lessors until the respective maintenance event occurs and the reimbursement with the lessor is finalised.
Any payment that is not expected to be reimbursed by the lessor is recognised within operating expenses aircraft rentals in the statement of comprehensive income.
Other The Group enters into agreements with maintenance service providers that guarantee the maintenance of major components at a rate defined in the contract, the prime example being fleet hour agreements FHAs for aircraft engines.
Such FHAs cover the cost of both scheduled and unscheduled engine overhauls.
FHA payments are accounted for as follows: E Payments for scheduled maintenance work are recognised as advances paid for aircraft maintenance assets until the maintenance asset for the respective engine overhaul is created.
After this point any further FHA payments are either used to settle previously established aircraft maintenance provisions to the extent a provision for the respective FHA contract exists or, in the absence of a provision, are added to the amount previously capitalised within property, plant and equipment as advances paid for aircraft maintenance assets.
E Payments that are made to provide guaranteed coverage for the performance of unscheduled maintenance events are considered as insurance payments and are expensed as incurred.
Please refer to the property, plant and equipment section of accounting policies.

Accounting policies continued Supplier credits The Group receives certain assets cash contributions or aircraft spares for nil consideration in connection with its acquisition of aircraft and of major aircraft parts.
Cash contributions or aircraft spares received are recognised as an asset in the statement of financial position.
The corresponding credits are recognised as income, spread equally across the shorter of useful economic life and the lease term of the respective aircraft.
In certain cases the concessions receivable from a component manufacturer are linked to the Groups commitment to purchase a number of new aircraft with the manufacturers components installed on those.
In such case, in substance, the right to the concessions is earned by the Group through the delivery of the respective aircraft.
In certain cases the concessions might be delivered by the component manufacturer later than the date when the respective aircraft is taken by the Group.
If so, then the right earned for the concession is recognised at the date of the aircraft delivery as part of trade and other receivables, with a corresponding credit to deferred income.
Following this, the credits are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term of the respective asset, decreasing aircraft rental expenses.
Net financing costs Net financing costs comprise interest payable, finance charges on finance leases, interest receivable on funds invested and foreign exchange gains and losses that are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Interest income and interest payable are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.
Non-cash elements of financial income and expenses are eliminated from the statement of cash flows as an adjusting item whereas cash elements, e. g. realised foreign exchange gains and losses, are included in the statement of cash flows.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Qualifying transaction costs directly attributable to the issuing of new shares are debited to equity, reducing the share premium arising on the issue of shares.
Taxation Taxation on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.

Segment reporting Operating and reportable segments The Group is managed as a single business unit that provides low-cost, low-fare passenger air transportation services using a fleet of single aircraft type.
The Group has only one reportable segment being its entire route network.
Management information is provided to the Executive Management Team which is the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
Resource allocation decisions are made by the CODM for the benefit of the route network as a whole, rather than for individual routes within the network.
The performance of the network is assessed primarily based on the operating profit or loss for the period.
Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Group is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates.
The objective of financial risk management at Wizz Air is to minimise the impact of commodity price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Group's earnings, cash flows and equity.
To manage commodity and foreign exchange risks, Wizz Air uses various derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency and commodity zero cost collar contracts.
Risk management is carried out by the treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, fuel price risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments, adherence to hedge accounting, and hedge coverage levels.
The Board has mandated the Audit Committee of the Board to supervise the hedging activity of the Group and the compliance with the policies approved by the Board.
Risk analysis Market risks Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and commitments that are denominated in a currency other than the Euro.
The main currency that gives rise to foreign currency risk related to purchases is primarily the US Dollar USD, while the currencies giving rise to foreign currency risk related to sales revenues are primarily the British Pound GBP and the Polish Zloty PLN.
The foreign currency exposure is significant as only a small portion of the Groups revenues are denominated or linked to the USD while a significant portion of the Groups expenses are USD denominated, including fuel, aircraft leases, maintenance reserves and aviation insurance.
The Group chooses the Euro USD foreign currency rate as the underlying foreign currency pair in its foreign currency rate hedging strategies.
The main objective is to cover the Groups ongoing USD cash flow requirements.
The Groups maximum hedge coverage level is 75 per cent.
of the total anticipated USD purchases hedged by the time the respective quarter on monthly rolling forward basis is reached.
This maximum target hedge coverage level was 70 per cent.
until 31 March 2014 and increased to 75 per cent.
during the year ended 31 March 2016.
These levels were not always maintained during the current or prior years.

If the net balance of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies is high then this translation process can result in material volatility to financial income and expense, and thus to earnings.
Historically the Group had a high balance of net monetary assets denominated in US Dollar and this resulted in significant unrealised foreign exchange gains as in 2015 and losses as in 2016.
By the end of the 2016 financial year the US Dollar monetary asset-liability position of the Group became materially balanced, therefore starting from financial year 2017 there are no material movements expected in this area.
This is not visible from the table above that shows a net asset balance of US Dollar denominated financial instruments of 93.4 million in 2016.
The two positions can be reconciled as follows: E the balance of trade and other receivables at 31 March 2016 includes USD 34.5 million that has been designated for hedge accounting and therefore is not subject to foreign currency revaluation see under foreign exchange hedge with non-derivatives later in this Note 3: and E at 31 March 2016 the Group had provisions of 60.2 million denominated in US Dollars as part of the total 83.7 million balance reported in Note 29.
Provisions are not financial instruments and therefore their balance is not included in the table above.

Financial risk management continued Risk analysis continued Market risks continued Interest rate risk The Group has future commitments under certain operating lease contracts that are based on floating interest rates.
The floating nature of the interest charges on the operating leases exposes the Group to interest rate risk.
Interest rates charged on convertible debt liabilities and on short and long-term loans to finance the deposits of aircraft are not sensitive to interest rate movements as they are fixed until maturity.
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk in relation to the valuation of financial instruments as they are carried at fair value.
The Group has not used financial derivatives to hedge its interest rate risk during the year.
The Directors may in the future consider hedging interest rate risk to reduce the potential Group earnings volatility arising from fluctuations in interest rates.
Commodity risks One of the most significant costs for the Group is jet fuel.
The price of jet fuel can be volatile and can directly impact the Groups financial performance.
The Groups maximum hedge coverage level under its hedge programme is 75 per cent.
of the total anticipated fuel purchases hedged by the time the respective quarter on a monthly rolling forward basis is reached.
The hedge coverage level during the year ended 31 March 2015 averaged 70 per cent.
Hedge transactions during the periods The Group uses non-derivatives and zero cost collar instruments to hedge its foreign exchange exposures and uses zero cost collar and outright cap instruments to hedge its jet fuel exposures.
The time horizon of the hedging programme with derivatives is a usually up to a maximum of 18 months: however, this horizon can be exceeded at the Boards discretion.
The volume of hedge transactions expired during the periods was as follows: a Foreign exchange hedge USD versus EUR : USD 339.0 million 2015: USD 390.0 million.
Hedge year-end open positions At the end of the year and the prior year the Group had the following open hedge positions: a Foreign exchange hedge with derivatives: The fair value of the open positions was 4.8 million gain 2015: 37.5 million gain recognised within other comprehensive income, current assets or current liabilities, respectively.
The notional amount of the open positions was USD 313.5 million 2015: USD 297.0 million.
b Foreign exchange hedge with non-derivatives: The notional amount of the open positions was USD 190.5 million 2015: USD 132.0 million.
Non-derivatives are existing financial assets that hedge highly probable foreign currency cash flows in the future, therefore act as a natural hedge.
During the year out of its non-derivative financial assets the Group designated USD 34.5 million for hedge accounting 2015: nil.
The rest of the open positions relate to expected PDP refunds USD 156.0 million in 2016 and USD 132.0 million in 2015, for which no hedge accounting is applied.
c Fuel hedge: The fair value of the open positions was 11.4 million loss 2015: 84.4 million loss recognised within other comprehensive income and current assets or liabilities, respectively.
The notional amount of the open positions was 449,000 metric tons 2015: 888,500 metric tons.
In relation to these open hedge positions the cash flows will occur and the hedge relationships will impact the statement of comprehensive income during the years ending 31 March 2017.
Hedge effectiveness During the year covered by these financial statements, based on the evaluation of the Group, the hedging transactions did not give rise to material ineffectiveness under IAS 39.
As explained below in the credit risk section, in the opinion of the management none of the hedge counterparties had a material change in their credit status that would have influenced the effectiveness of the hedging transactions.

The impact of these macro-economic variables on equity is the same as the impact on profit after tax, except for the fuel price and for the USD EUR FX rate variables where the equity impact would also include the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that are open at the year end.
The fair value of these instruments was provided by the hedge counterparties and management has not calculated the theoretical value of these instruments for other scenarios.
Liquidity risks Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding.
The Group has an adequate liquidity position.
The Group invests excess cash in a conservative way, primarily in AAA-rated money market funds and also in short-term time deposits with high quality bank counterparties.
The table below analyses the Groups financial assets and liabilities receivable or payable either on cash base or net-settled derivative financial assets and liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the statement of financial position date to the contractual maturity date.

The Company provides guarantees in relation to aircraft lease contracts to guarantee the performance of its airline subsidiaries.
These possible obligations are disclosed in the table above, with the shortest maturity under the financial guarantees line.
Management does not expect that any payment under these guarantee contracts will be required in the future because the respective subsidiaries have so far paid all their liabilities under the lease contracts and are expected to do so also in the future.
Other financial guarantee contracts relate to hedging, aircraft pre-delivery payments, and convertible loans and notes.
The respective liabilities are reflected under the appropriate line of the financial liabilities part of the table above.
Since the liability itself is already reflected in the table, it would not be appropriate to include also the financial guarantee provided by another Group entity for the same obligation.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk from individual customers is limited as the large majority of the payments for flight tickets are collected before the service is provided.
However, the Group has significant banking, hedging, aircraft manufacturer and card acquiring relationships that represent counterparty credit risk.
The Group analysed the creditworthiness of the relevant business partners in order to assess the likelihood of non-performance of liabilities due to the Group.
The credit quality of the Groups financial assets is assessed by reference to external credit ratings published by Standard & Poors of the counterparties as follows: AAA AA A AOther Unrated Total At 31 March 2016 million million million million million million million Financial assets Trade and other receivables - - - - 18.6 179.1 197.7 Derivative financial assets - - 1.6 0.1 - - 1.7 Financial assets available for sale - 1.0 - - - - 1.0 Cash 547.5 - 96.8 - - 1.3 645.6 Restricted cash - - 101.0 - - 0.6 101.6 Total financial assets 547.5 1.0 199.4 0.1 18.6 181.0 947.6 AAA AA A AOther Unrated Total At 31 March 2015 million million million million million million million Financial assets Trade and other receivables - - - 0.5 14.7 152.7 167.9 Derivative financial assets 22.3 - 35.9 2.5 - - 60.7 Financial assets available for sale - - 1.0 - - - 1.0 Cash 357.7 - 89.9 - - 1.0 448.6 Restricted cash - - 71.8 1.7 - 0.1 73.6 Total financial assets 380.0 - 198.6 4.7 14.7 153.8 751.8 Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2016 93 ACCOUNTS AND OTHER INFORMATION NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3.
Financial risk management continued Credit risk continued The Other column shows the receivables from the Groups main credit card acquirer.
This partner has a credit rating of two on a scale of four one being the best, provided by Dun & Bradstreet.
From the unrated category within trade and other receivables the Group has 97.3 million 2015: 86.8 million receivables from different aircraft lessors in respect of maintenance reserves and lease security deposits paid see also Note 19.
However, given that the Group physically possesses the aircraft owned by the lessors and that the Group has significant future lease payment obligations towards the same lessors see Note 32, management does not consider the credit risk on maintenance reserve receivables to be material.
Based on the information above management does not consider the counterparty risk of either party being material and therefore no fair value adjustment was applied to the respective cash or receivable balances.
Fair value estimation The Group classifies its financial instruments based on the technique used for determining fair value into the following categories: Level 1: Fair value is determined based on quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Fair value is determined based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: Fair value is determined based on inputs that are not based on observable market data that is, on unobservable inputs.
The following table presents the Groups financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 March 2016.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total million million million million Assets Financial assets available for sale 1.0 - - 1.0 Derivative financial instruments - 1.7 - 1.7 1.0 1.7 - 2.7 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments - 17.6 - 17.6 - 17.6 - 17.6 Financial assets available for sale represents a unit linked insurance invested in government bonds by the insurer.
These government bonds are traded in an active market therefore it falls into the Level 1 category.
The Group measures its derivative financial instruments at fair value, calculated with a technique by the banks involved in the hedging transactions that falls into the Level 2 category.
All the other financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for Shareholders, to provide benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The capital structure of the Group consists of financial liabilities, cash and cash equivalents and equity.
Financial liabilities primarily consist of commercial loans relating to aircraft financing and convertible debt as disclosed in Notes 23 and 24 respectively.
Equity comprises issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the statement of changes in equity.
Since the financial year beginning on 1 April 2007, the Groups growth has been financed entirely out of cash from operations and commercial debt with financial institutions.
The overall capital risk management strategy remains unchanged from prior years.
Management reviews the Groups cost of capital on an ongoing basis as well as the risks associated with each capital instrument and makes recommendations to the Board for approval.

Critical accounting estimates and judgments made in applying the Groups accounting policies a Maintenance policy For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, provision is made for the minimum unavoidable costs of specific future obligations created by the lease at the time when such obligation becomes certain.
The amount of the provision involves making estimates of the cost of the heavy maintenance work that is required to discharge the obligation, including any end of lease costs.
The cost of heavy maintenance is capitalised and recognised as a tangible fixed asset and classified as aircraft maintenance asset at the earlier of a the time the lease re-delivery condition is no longer met or b when maintenance including enhancement is carried out.
The calculation of the depreciation charge on such assets involves making estimates for the future utilisation of the aircraft and in case of engines also of the future operating conditions of the engine.
b Hedge and derivative accounting Fair value of derivatives namely open position of cash flow hedges is determined by the contracting financial institutions as per their industry practice.
As required, the fair values ascribed to those instruments are verified also by management using high-level models.
Further, the effectiveness of hedges is tested both prospectively and retrospectively to determine the appropriate accounting treatment of hedge gains and losses.
c Net presentation of government taxes and other similar levies The Groups accounting policy stipulates that where charges levied by airports or government authorities on a per passenger basis represent a government tax in fact or in substance, then such amounts are presented on a net basis in the statement of comprehensive income netted between revenue and airport, handling and en-route charges lines.
Management reviews all passenger-based charges levied by airports and government authorities to ensure that any amounts recovered from passengers in respect of these charges are appropriately classified within the statement of comprehensive income.
Given the variability of these charges and the number of airports and jurisdictions within which the Group operates, the assessment of whether these items constitute taxes in nature is an inherently complex area, requiring a level of judgement.
Segment information Reportable segment information The chief operating decision maker of the Group, as defined in IFRS 8 Segment reporting, is the executive management team of the Group.

These costs were not accrued earlier during the vesting period of the options because until 2014 it was not assumed that Swiss social security would apply to the exercise of most of these options.
Exceptional items and underlying profit Exceptional items In the 2016 financial year the Group had a net exceptional expense of 16.3 million from the following: E 16.3 million of net financial expense, consisting of: i exceptional expense of 25.0 million relating to the change in time value of open hedge positions, particularly fuel caps: ii exceptional income of 8.7 million relating to realised foreign exchange gain arising on a one-off replacement of USD 75.6 million bank deposits behind collaterals with Euro deposits.
In the 2015 financial year the Group had an exceptional income of 9.2 million from the following: E 2.8 million of operating expenses in relation to the IPO of the Company.
These consisted of i 1.6 million within staff costs for a one-off IPO bonus for employees other than senior management: and ii 1.2 million within other expenses for advisory fees incurred in relation to the IPO.
E 12.0 million of net financial income, consisting of: i an exceptional income of 14.5 million relating to the recycling of the balance of the cumulated translation adjustment account from equity to the statement of comprehensive income.
This balance had been accumulated in relation to Wizz Air Ukraine, and the Company announced in March 2015 that the operations of this subsidiary would be discontinued which then happened in April 2015: and ii an exceptional expense of 2.5 million arising on the extension of the Companys convertible debt in August 2015 see Note 25.

Exceptional items and underlying profit continued Exceptional items continued The financial income and expense items are non-cash therefore are not impacting the statement of cash flows.
The cash flow impact of the 2.8 million of IPO-related operating expenses is not significant in either year and is therefore not presented as an exceptional item in the statement of cash flows.
The 1.0 million exceptional cash inflow in the statement of cash flows for 2014 relates to a settlement received from the main credit card acquirer of the Group, related to prior years 6.3 million total settlement, of which 5.3 million was received in the 2014 financial year and the remaining 1.0 million in 2015.
These items were used by management in the determination of the non-GAAP underlying profit measure for the Group see below.
Underlying profit 2016 2015 million million Profit for the period 192.9 183.2 Adjustments exclusions : Unrealised foreign exchange loss gain 14.7 27.8 Exceptional items net loss gain 16.3 9.2 Sum of adjustments 31.0 37.0 Underlying profit after tax 223.9 146.2 On top of the exceptional items listed in Note 9, unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses are also excluded from the calculation of underlying profit.
These are non-cash translation differences that arise primarily on the revaluation of the significant net US Dollar monetary asset position of the Group.
This had material impact particularly in the 2015 financial year due to the significant strengthening of the US Dollar against the Euro in the period.
The unrealised loss in 2016 relates primarily to the conversion of USD 75.6 million collaterals into Euro this transaction alone resulted in 8.7 million realised foreign exchange gain on one hand and 12.4 million unrealised foreign exchange loss on the other hand the latter being the reversal of the unrealised gains recognised on these assets since their initial recognition.
That is, the net foreign exchange impact of this conversion in 2016 was 3.7 million loss all included in the adjustments in the table above.
The tax effects of the adjustments made above are insignificant.

Net financing income and expense continued Interest income and expense contain interest on financial instruments and the effect of the initial discounting of long-term deposits and the later unwinding of such discounting.
Interest expense includes also withholding tax paid in Switzerland on the interest accrued on convertible loans.
This withholding tax for these instruments is the liability of the Group according to the terms of the respective loan agreements.
Interest expense on convertible debt is lower in 2016 because i a significant part of the convertible debt was converted into shares in 2015, linked to the IPO of the Company: ii interest rates were also reduced during 2015: and iii Swiss withholding tax of 0.4 million previously incurred on convertible debt was now recovered and credited to interest expenses.
The fuel caps premium of 5.3 million in 2016 relates to the option fees for fuel caps expired in the period these were paid in the 2015 financial year.
Out of the unrealised foreign exchange loss of 14.7 million in 2016 12.4 million was caused by the replacement of US Dollar bank deposits behind collaterals with Euro deposits.
This is because the unrealised foreign exchange gain recognised on these assets until March 2015 now had to be reversed due to their fiderecognition see also in Note 9.
For the year ended 31 March 2015 the net realised foreign exchange loss of 11.6 million was primarily driven by the devaluation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia and by the strengthening of the US Dollar against the Euro.
The net unrealised foreign exchange gain of 27.8 million was primarily driven by the strengthening of the US Dollar against the Euro, impacting through the revaluation of the net US Dollar monetary asset position of the Group.

Substantially all the profits of the Group in 2016 and 2015 were made by Wizz Air Hungary Kft, the airline subsidiary of the Group, and substantially all the tax charges presented in this Note were incurred by this entity.
Other income based foreign tax represents the innovation contribution and the local business tax payable in Hungary in 2016 and 2015 by the Hungarian subsidiaries of the Group, primarily Wizz Air Hungary Kft.
Hungarian local business tax and innovation contribution are levied on an adjusted profit basis.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during each period.
2016 2015 Profit from the year, million 192.9 183.2 Weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue 53,344,145 12,693,373 Basic earnings per share, EUR 3.62 14.43 There were also 44,830,503 Convertible Shares in issue at 31 March 2016 see Note 28.
These shares are non-participating, i. e. the profit attributable to them is nil.
Therefore these shares are not included in the basic earnings per share calculation above.
Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue with the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares that could have been issued in the respective year as a result of the conversion of various convertible instruments.
In this respect the period prior to IPO in March 2015 and post IPO have different characteristics, as explained below, which causes the significant difference between the fully diluted share numbers between the two years.
Period prior to IPO: E Convertible notes and loans: Not all of the shares which would have been issued on full conversion of the convertible debt instruments have been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation as there were contractual restrictions limiting the number which could be converted.
These restrictions were in place to ensure that the Group remains owned and controlled by a majority of EU nationals.
E Employee share options: Conversion of employee share options was not assumed because the completion of an IPO by the Company was one of the vesting conditions that was not met before March 2015 see Note 28 for further details.
Period post IPO: E Convertible Shares: The Convertible Shares that were issued on the IPO as a result of the conversion of some of the convertible loans and notes were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation.
E Convertible notes remaining after IPO: These can be converted at the option of the holder into Ordinary Shares, although these might be subject to restrictions on voting and dividend rights.
E Employee share options: Vested share options are included in the calculation.
Since the IPO there are no further criteria in place that would limit the exercisability of vested share options.
The profit for the year has been adjusted for the purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share in respect of the interest charge relating to the debt which could have been converted into shares.
2016 2015 Profit for the year, million 192.9 183.2 Interest expense on convertible debt net of tax, million 1.6 1.0 Profit used to determine diluted earnings per share, million 194.5 184.2 Weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue 53,344,145 12,693,373 Adjustment for assumed conversion of convertible instruments 73,208,656 13,940,632 Weighted average number of Ordinary Shares for diluted earnings per share 126,552,801 26,634,005 Diluted earnings per share, EUR 1.54 6.91 Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2016 100 ACCOUNTS AND OTHER INFORMATION NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 12.
Earnings per share continued Proforma earnings per share The proforma earnings per share is a fully diluted non-IFRS measure defined by the Company, calculated as follows: 2016 2015 Underlying profit for the year, million 223.9 146.2 1 Interest expense on convertible debt, million 1.6 4.5 Profit used to determine proforma earnings per share, million 225.4 150.7 2 Number of shares in issue at year end 101,752,674 101,110,618 3 Adjustment for assumed conversion of convertible debt instruments 24,246,715 24,246,716 Adjustment for assumed conversion of employee share options 765,390 1,117,446 Fully diluted number of shares for proforma earnings per share 126,764,779 126,474,780 Proforma earnings per share, EUR 1.78 1.19 1 Interest expense on convertible debt is lower in 2016 because interest rates were reduced during 2015 and a significant part of the debt was converted into shares on IPO in 2015.
2 The issued share number includes also the 44.8 million Convertible Shares in issue at 31 March 2016 2015: 48.8 million.
See Note 28 for share capital.
3 Interest outstanding on convertible notes in issue at year end is not taken into account for conversion because it is more likely to be paid in cash than converted into shares as it was the case also in the past.
The calculation of the proforma underlying EPS is different from the calculation of the IFRS diluted EPS measure in the following: E For earnings the underlying profit for the year was used see Note 10, as opposed to the statutory IFRS profit for the year.
E For the fully diluted number of shares, i year-end position was taken rather than the weighted average for the year and ii all convertible debts were taken into account for their dilution impact as at the year end.
By contrast, the IFRS diluted EPS measure takes a weighted average position for the year and includes only those convertible debt instruments that could be converted by the holder without any restriction.
The proforma EPS measure was introduced by the Company to better reflect the underlying earnings and the underlying equity structure, particularly to remove the distortion that was caused by the special conversion restrictions existing for convertible debt until the IPO in March 2015.
The latter issue was relevant last for the 2015 financial year.
In the 2016 financial year the same instruments were place both during the year and at the end of the year: therefore, the fully diluted share number was almost the same in the diluted EPS calculation as in the proforma EPS calculation.

Approximately half of this increase was related to the delivery of a spare engine from IAE.
This is the first owned spare engine of the Group the others are all leased under operating lease contracts.
In May 2015 the Group entered into an amendment of its existing IAE Fleet Hour Agreement FHA that covers the scheduled and unscheduled maintenance of its aircraft engines.
The reason for the change was that the type of IAE engines used by the Group V2500 family have had better operational performance than originally expected by the parties sufficient empirical evidence now exists that demonstrate that engines can stay onwing longer before they need to be taken into the shop for a scheduled shop visit.
This change was reflected in a revised engine maintenance plan of the Group, supported by the amendment of the FHA with IAE.
Many of the engines of the Group that were in May 2015 out of condition under the lease return conditions of the respective aircraft lease agreement became in condition as a consequence of these changes.
The aircraft maintenance assets that existed for these engines were fide-recognised and their net book value was transferred to advances paid for aircraft maintenance assets as reflected in the net 10.5 million reverse direction transfer between the two asset categories in 2015.
Depreciation for these fide-recognised assets ceased in May 2015 that resulted in the lower depreciation charge for aircraft maintenance assets in 2016 when compared to 2015.
A new asset is recognised and depreciation is re-commenced when the engine becomes out of condition for its lease contract under the new amended FHA and the revised maintenance plan.

This balance remained unchanged at 31 March 2016.
This loss can be utilised only to offset profits generated under Hungarian tax residency.
The Group does not expect to have profit generated under Hungarian tax residency in the foreseeable future and therefore no deferred tax asset is recognised in this respect.

This amount is restricted until September 2016.
Derivative financial instruments 2016 2015 million million Assets Non-current derivatives Cash flow hedges - 22.1 Current derivatives Cash flow hedges 1.7 38.6 Total derivative financial assets 1.7 60.7 Liabilities Non-current derivatives Cash flow hedges 1.2 1.8 Current derivatives Cash flow hedges 16.4 79.9 Total derivative financial liabilities 17.6 81.7 The derivative financial instruments represent cash flow hedges see also Note 3.
The full value of a hedging derivative is classified as a current asset or current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than twelve months.
The cash flow hedges expiring in 2016 had an ineffective portion of 1.0 million 2015: 0.8 million.
The balance of derivative assets decreased versus 2015 for the following reasons: i At the end of the 2015 financial year the Group had significant receivables from open Fx collars that were entered into before the heavy appreciation of the US Dollar to the Euro during 2014.
These instruments were all settled during the 2016 financial year, and by 31 March 2016 the contracted rates of the open Fx collars were very close to the market spot rate.
ii The 31 March 2015 balance included 22.6 million in relation to the fair value of fuel caps while by 31 March 2016 the fair value reduced to 0.8 million.
The reduction is mainly due to change in time value - as discussed in Note 9, the Group recognised 25.0 million financial expense classified as exceptional item relating to the change in time value of open hedge positions, particularly fuel caps.
The balance of derivative liabilities decreased versus 2015 because at 31 March 2016 the majority of the open fuel hedge instruments were caps for which the Group does not have a liability when market rates are below the capped rate, while at 31 March 2015 the majority of open fuel hedge instruments were collars for which the Group had significant liability due to the market rates for jet fuel at the time being significantly below the floor rates of the collars.
The net position of assets and liabilities does match the cash flow hedging reserve in the statement of financial position because i the hedging reserve does not include the time value of open options, only the intrinsic value: ii hedging with non-derivatives has an impact on the hedging reserve 2016 only : and iii the balance of derivative assets is influenced also by the cash deposits paid in relation to fuel caps purchase options open at the end of the year.

Deferred PDP interest is the deferred part of PDP interest expenses incurred on leased aircraft or spare engines.
Such interest relates to aircraft or spare engine PDP payments financed by third parties, and is initially recognised under property, plant and equipment advances paid for aircraft.
When the leased aircraft or spare engine is delivered, PDP interest is reclassified to deferred interest expense.
It is then amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term of the respective asset and the amortisation charge is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as aircraft rental expense.

Current deferred income represents the value of tickets paid by passengers for which the flight service is yet to be performed and the current part of the value of assets received for nil consideration.
Employee benefits Share based payments The share based payment charge in the financial statements for the year relates to three types of instruments that are in issue at 31 March 2016: share awards issued to Directors of the Board during 2006-2013 and employee share options issued i during until January 2015 under the 2005 International Employee Share Option Plan ESOP and ii in July 2015 under the 2014 Employee Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP of the Group.
The awards and options are classified as equity-settled share based payments.
The Company issues new shares for any options exercised, irrespective of the method of exercise.
The fair value of the awards and options is recognised as staff cost over the estimated vesting period with a corresponding charge to equity.

For the Performance Options the performance conditions are set as follows, with 50% weighting for each: E total shareholder return TSR of the Group relative to the TSR of certain selected European airlines over the three-year period following the award: and E absolute growth in underlying, fully diluted earnings per share of the Group, measured over the period from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2018.
The percentage of Performance Options that will vest will be determined on a pro-rata basis payout rate, to the extent that the target levels for these performance conditions will be met by the Group.

The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of trade receivables and payables.
Long-term financial assets and liabilities which are classified as fair value through profit and loss are recognised on fair value.
Trade and other receivables due after more than one year are almost exclusively maintenance reserves, with an average term of approximately four years.
The fair value of these assets is determined by discounting at a rate of interest of four years USD swap rate prevailing on the last day of the financial year.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on their actual mark-to-market evaluation of the financial institutions.
During the year a 71.0 million loss 2015: 7.2 million loss was realised on derivative financial assets and liabilities in the income statement.
During the year a 48,000 loss 2015: 26,000 gain was realised on financial assets available for sale.

Contingent liabilities Legal disputes European Commission state aid investigations Six of the European Commissions on-going state aid investigations which are in their formal phase concern arrangements between Wizz Air and certain airports to which it flies, namely, Timioara, Cluj-Napoca, Targu Mures, Beauvais, Girona and Lbeck.
Wizz Air has submitted its legal observations and supporting economic analyses of these arrangements to the European Commission.
Ultimately, an adverse decision by the European Commission could result in a repayment order for the recovery from Wizz Air of any amount determined by the European Commission to be illegal state aid.
None of these on-going investigations are expected to lead to exposure that is material to the Group.
The European Commission has given notice that the state aid investigations involving Wizz Air will be assessed on the basis of new EU Guidelines on State aid to airports and airlines which were adopted by the European Commission on 20 February 2014.
Where relevant, Wizz Air has made further submissions to the European Commission in connection with this notification.
Claims by Carpatair Carpatair, a regional airline based in Romania, started a number of cases in the Romanian courts during 2012 and 2013 which relate to Carpatairs allegations that Timioara airport granted unlawful state aid to Wizz Air pursuant to an agreement between the parties or by virtue of the publicly available scheme of charges published by Timioara airport.
Wizz Air is intervening in the defence of these claims, either in its own right or in support of Timioara airport.
One of these cases determined that state aid existed in the 2010 scheme of charges, but failed to substantiate that decision or to quantify the amount involved.
Following this decision, Carpatair began a case in which both Timioara airport and Wizz Air are named as defendants and, pursuant to which, Carpatair aims to have the alleged state aid under the 2010 scheme of charges quantified and a repayment order issued.
Wizz Air understands that the Romanian Chamber of Accounts has issued a decision requiring Timioara airport to recover from Wizz Air an amount of approximately 3 million in respect of the state aid attributable to the 2010 and 2011 scheme of charges despite there having been no expert quantification of the amount and the airport has now started proceedings which Wizz Air is defending.
In January 2016 Carpatair filed a new legal action registered with the Bucharest Tribunal against Timisoara Airport, the Romanian Ministry of Transports and Wizz Air.
The legal action was sent by the court to Wizz Air on 22 April 2016.
By the said legal action Carpatair asks the court to order the three defendants to pay, jointly, to Carpatair damages preliminarily estimated to amount to 92 million and interest related to the said amount, resulting from an alleged state aid granted by Timisoara Airport to Wizz Air, from the existence of a marketing agreement between Timisoara Airport and Wizz Air and from an abuse of dominant position on the part of Timisoara Airport.
Wizz Air is currently reviewing the substance of the new legal action and will submit its defense in due course.
Management estimates that the maximum potential exposure for these cases could be in the region of 113 million including the 3 million and the 92 million specifically mentioned above.
No provision has been made by the Group in relation to these issues because there is currently no reason to believe that the Group will incur charges from these cases.
Subsequent events There were no matters arising, between the statement of financial position date and the date on which these financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors, requiring adjustment or disclosure in accordance with IAS 10, Events after the reporting period, other than the following: E The Group entered into Letter of Intent with various lessors for sale and leaseback financing of 21 of its future aircraft to be delivered in the period between July 2017 and July 2018.

of the Companys issued share capital and 44,830,503 of Convertible Shares of the Company 2015: 6,740,633 Ordinary Shares and 48,830,503 Convertible Shares.
Indigo has interest in convertible debt instruments issued by the Company see Note 24.
The Companys liability to Indigo, including principal and accrued interest, was 27.2 million at 31 March 2016 2015: 27.3 million.
During the year ended 31 March 2016 the Company entered into transactions with Indigo as follows: E Indigo converted 4,000,000 Convertible Shares into the Companys Ordinary Shares: E the Company recognised interest expense on convertible debt instruments held by Indigo in the amount of 2.0 million 2015: 3.9 million : and E fees of 0.1 million 2015: 0.1 million were paid to Indigo in respect of the remuneration of two of the Directors who were delegated by Indigo to the Board of Directors of the Company.
Transactions with key management personnel Officers members of executive management and Directors of the Board are considered to be key management personnel.
The compensation of key management personnel, including Non-Executive Directors, is as follows: 2016 2015 million million Salaries and other short-term employee benefits 6.6 6.0 Social security costs 1.3 3.2 Share based payments 0.9 0.2 Amounts paid to third parties in respect of Directors service 0.2 0.2 Total key management compensation expense 9.1 9.6 Social security costs were exceptionally high in financial year 2015 because of the vesting of most of the share options held by the Officers, and the exercise of most of these vested options.
These social security costs were not accrued earlier during the vesting period of the options because until 2014 it was not assumed that Swiss social security would apply to the exercise of most of these options.
Ultimate controlling party In the opinion of the Directors there is no individual controlling party in relation to the Company's issued Ordinary Shares.
As at 8 April 2016 approximately 53.3% of the Ordinary Shares in the Company were owned by Qualifying Nationals.
Shareholders and potential investors are reminded that the Groups Hungarian operating licence depends, inter alia, on Qualifying Nationals owning more than 50 per cent.
The Companys articles of association enable the Directors to take action to ensure that the amount of Ordinary Shares held by Non-Qualifying Nationals does not reach a level that could jeopardise the Groups entitlement to continue to hold or enjoy the benefit of any operating licence that benefits the Group.
Qualifying Nationals include: i EEA Nationals, ii nationals of Switzerland and iii in respect of any undertaking, an undertaking that satisfies the conditions as to nationality of ownership and control of undertakings granted an operating licence contained in Article 4 f of the Air Services Regulation, as such conditions may be amended, varied, supplemented or replaced from time to time, or as provided for in any agreement between the EU and any third country whether or not such undertaking is itself granted an operating licence.
A Non-Qualifying National is any person who is not a Qualifying National in accordance with the definition above.
