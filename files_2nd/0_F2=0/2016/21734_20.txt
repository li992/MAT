Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
General information a Overview Booker Group plc is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom Registration number 05145685.
The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its registered address is Equity House, Irthlingborough Road, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, NN8 1LT.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic and Directors Reports.
b Basis of accounting In accordance with EU law IAS Regulation EC 1606 2002, the group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted for use in the EU as at 25 March 2016 adopted IFRS, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company accounts in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP including FRS101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
The group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling and rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
The financial statements for the current period have been prepared for a 52 week period to reflect internal management reporting.
c Basis of consolidation On 4 June 2007 the Company, then named Blueheath Holdings plc, became the legal parent company of Giant Topco Limited in a share-for-share transaction.
Due to the relative values of the companies, the former Giant Topco Limited shareholders became the majority shareholders with 90.36% of the enlarged share capital.
As part of the business combination Blueheath Holdings plc changed its name to Booker Group plc and changed its accounting reference date to 31 March.
Following the transaction, the Companys continuing operations and executive management were predominantly those of Booker Wholesale Holdings Limited.
IFRS3 Business Combinations defines the acquirer in a business combination as the entity that obtains control.
Accordingly, the combination was accounted as a reverse acquisition i. e. as if Giant Topco Limited had acquired Blueheath Holdings plc in return for consideration equal to the fair value of the shares issued.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with an entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
d Accounting standards adopted in the period The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued and applied by the Group in these financial statements for the first time.
Their adoption does not have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated: New standards: None Amendments and interpretations: Amendments to IAS19 Defined benefit plans: Employee contributions Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-12 cycle Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-13 cycle Their adoption does not have a material effect on the financial statements.
70 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial Statements e New IFRS and amendments to IAS and interpretations There are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are effective for financial statements after this reporting period but have not yet been endorsed by the European Union as follows: Effective for accounting periods starting on or after IFRS14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts 1 January 2016 Amendments to IFRS10, IFRS12 and IAS28 Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception 1 January 2016 Amendments to IAS16 and IAS28 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 1 January 2016 Amendments to IFRS11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations 1 January 2016 IFRS15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 IFRS9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS16 Leases 1 January 2019 The application of these standards and interpretations is not anticipated to have a material effect on the Groups financial statements, other than IFRS16 Leases which is currently being assessed.
f Going concern The risks noted in the Strategic Report are those known to the Directors at the date of this Report which the Directors consider to be material to the Group, but these do not necessarily comprise all the risks to which the Group is exposed.
In particular, the Groups performance could be adversely affected by poor economic conditions.
Additional risks and uncertainties currently unknown to the Directors, or which the Directors currently believe are immaterial, may also have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or prospects of the Group.
In August 2015, the Group negotiated an unsecured bank facility of 120m for a period of 5 years.
At the period end, the Group had net cash of 127.4m.
In addition, the Group complied with all its covenants during the year.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of possible changes in trading performance and considering the risks identified, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its bank facility.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least twelve months from the date of this report.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group and Company financial statements.
71 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
General information continued g Use of assumptions and estimates The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are considered to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the estimates about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Some of these policies require a high level of judgement and the Directors believe that the most critical accounting policies and significant areas of judgement and estimation arise from the accounting for: IAS37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
The Group is party to a number of leases on properties that are no longer required for trading.
Judgement is applied in determining whether leases are onerous.
Whilst every effort is made to profitably sub-let these properties, it is not always possible to do so.
Where a lease is onerous to the Group, a provision is established for the difference between amounts contractually payable to the landlord and amounts contractually receivable from the tenant if any.
In addition, provisions exist for the expected future dilapidation cost on leasehold properties and the expected future costs of removing asbestos from leasehold properties.
The Directors consider that their estimates, which are based upon the advice of an in-house property department who monitor the UK property market, are appropriate.
Following the acquisition of Booker Retail Partners GB Limited and its subsidiaries, the Directors are required to fair value the assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition.
There is an exercise of judgement involved in identifying and valuing the assets acquired.
A summary of the assets and liabilities and the fair value adjustments are disclosed in note 9.
Defined benefit schemes are accounted for in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary but significant estimates are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, inflation, investment returns and mortality that underpin their valuations.
Sensitivities in relation to key assumptions are disclosed in note 18.
In testing for impairment of goodwill and other assets, the Directors make judgements in determining the cash generating units CGUs within the Group and allocating goodwill to these CGUs.
They then make assumptions concerning the future development of the CGUs that are consistent with its annual budget and forecast into perpetuity.
Should these assumptions regarding the discount rate or growth in the profitability be unfounded then it is possible that goodwill included in the balance sheet could be impaired.
At 25 March 2016, the Directors do not consider that any reasonably likely changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the goodwill to become impaired.
Sensitivities in relation to key assumptions are disclosed in note 11.
In applying the Groups accounting policy in relation to deferred tax, as set out below, the Directors are required to make assumptions regarding the Groups ability to utilise historical tax assets following an assessment of the likely quantum and timing of future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that the Directors are confident that the Groups future profits will utilise historical tax assets.
Similarly, the Directors are required to make an assessment of the quantum and timing of any future utilisation of Advanced Corporation Tax ACT and will only recognise ACT when they are certain that it can be utilised.
Accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
Intangible assets a Business combinations and goodwill Subject to the transitional relief in IFRS1, all business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 April 2006, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Goodwill is capitalised and is subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that its carrying value may not be recoverable.
72 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial Statements For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
b Other intangibles Customer relationships and know-how are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over 5 years, which is considered to be the useful economic life, and charged to administrative expenses.
Revenue Revenue is recognised when goods are received by the customer and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to them.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods net of discounts, volume rebates and value added tax.
Discounts are accounted for in the period they are earned.
Provision is made for expected customer returns.
Cost of sales Cost of sales represents all costs incurred, net of supplier rebates see below, up to the point of sale including the operating expenses of the trading outlets.
Supplier rebates A number of different types of rebate are negotiated with suppliers in connection with the purchase of goods for resale.
Such rebates are only recognised when earned by the Group, which occurs when all obligations conditional for earning the rebate have been discharged, and the rebate can be measured reliably based on the terms of the contract.
These rebates are recognised as a credit within cost of sales and, to the extent that the rebate relates to unsold stock purchases, as a reduction in the cost of inventory.
There are two main types of supplier rebates: a Terms, which are generally annual agreements not always coterminous with the Groups year end, are signed by the Group and the supplier.
Rebates are determined relative to volumes purchased or by other conditional arrangements as follows: Volume based rebates include overriders, advertising allowances and targeted income.
Rebates are accrued based on the Groups purchasing volumes and the current agreement with the supplier.
Amounts are recognised once confirmation of agreement to that rebate has been received from the supplier Non-volume based rebates include marketing support, range promotion and product development.
Amounts are recognised when the rebate is earned through the completion of any required obligations and confirmed by suppliers Invoices are issued to suppliers periodically, quarterly or annually, depending on the terms of the agreement.
73 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Accounting policies continued Supplier rebates continued b Promotional funding, which relates to price investments by suppliers through promotional activity.
The calculation of funding is mechanical and based on a formula agreed in advance of each promotion with the supplier.
Funding is recognised in the Income Statement as units are sold and is invoiced throughout the year, shortly after each promotion has ended.
Amounts relating to supplier rebates appear in a number of different balance sheet headings at the year end: Inventories: Where the rebate earned relates to inventories which are held by the Group at year end, the rebates are deducted from the cost of those inventories Trade receivables: Billed supplier rebates outstanding at the period end where the Group has no legal right to offset against trade payables Trade payables: Billed supplier rebates outstanding when the Group has a legal right to offset against payables Prepayments and accrued income: amounts due from suppliers in relation to supplier rebates which has been recognised but not yet invoiced Accruals and deferred income: amounts received in relation to supplier rebates that have not been earned at the year end Employee benefits a Share based payments The Group has issued equity settled share based payments to certain employees in exchange for services rendered by them.
The fair value is measured using an option valuation model at the date of grant and is recognised as an employee expense over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options, with a corresponding increase in equity, shown in a separate share option reserve.
This valuation is based on estimates of the number of options that will eventually vest, based on related service and non-market vesting conditions that are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
b Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
c Defined benefit plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets at bid price is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The defined benefit obligation calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses were recognised as at 1 April 2006, the date of transition to Adopted IFRSs.
In respect of actuarial gains and losses that arise subsequent to 1 April 2006 the Group recognises them in the period they occur directly in other comprehensive income.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Under IAS 19 2011, the Group determines the net interest expense income for the period on the net defined benefit liability asset by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability asset at the beginning of the period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability asset during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments.
d Short-term benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed as the related service is provided.
An accrual is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Exceptional items As permitted by IAS1 Presentation of financial statements, an item is disclosed separately if it is considered unusual by its nature and scale, and is of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood.
Such items are referred to as exceptional items.
74 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial Statements Financial instruments Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: a they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group: and b w here the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Companys exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are treated as distributions and are recorded directly in equity.
Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, available for sale financial assets, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
a Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
b Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
c Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and deposits repayable on demand.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
d Interest-bearing borrowings Interest bearing borrowings are recognised in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
Costs associated with extending the bank facility have been recognised in the income statement.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Guarantees Third party property guarantees are initially recognised as a financial liability under IAS37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
These are measured and recognised at fair value.
These property guarantees are included within Provisions on the balance sheet.
Impairment The carrying values of the Groups assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any impairment.
In performing the impairment reviews, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount and is recognised in the income statement.
75 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
Accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is based on either the weighted average principle or the FIFO basis and includes certain warehousing and distribution costs incurred in bringing the inventory to their existing location and condition less attributable supplier volume rebates see above.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of disposal.
Investment in joint ventures The Group conducts its joint venture arrangements through jointly controlled entities and accounts for them using the equity method of accounting.
The Group records its share of the joint controlled entities post tax profit or loss within the income statement and its share of the net assets within investments.
Where the Group transacts with its jointly controlled entities, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint venture.
Leases Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Where a lease has a minimum fixed increase, the total minimum lease payments are spread over the lease term.
The total amount payable over the life of the lease remains unchanged but the timing of the income statement charge relative to the lease payments change.
The excess of the rent charged over the cash payment in any period will be held on the balance sheet within Accruals and deferred income.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Net financing costs Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Operating segments IFRS8 Operating Segments requires that segments should be reported on the same basis as the internal reporting information that is provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been identified as the CEO.
In accordance with IFRS8, the Group may aggregate operating segments into one reportable segment to the extent that the criteria for aggregation in IFRS8 are met.
These criteria include consideration of whether the operating segments have similar economic characteristics: similar nature of products and services: similar type or class of customers: similar methods used to distribute products or provide services: and similar regulatory environments.
The CODM receives turnover information analysed in a number of different ways for example by customer and product types, by delivery channels and between Wholesale, Booker Direct, Chef Direct, and Ritter-Courivaud.
However, none of these possible segments have a unique management structure, products share the same supply chain and distribution channels, and there are a large amount of supplier rebates, expenses and assets liabilities that are not specific.
It is therefore not possible to analyse, and the CODM does not receive, information in respect of profitability or balance sheets in the same way in which turnover is analysed.
Internal reports reviewed regularly by the CODM focus on the operations of the Group as a whole and report the results and financial position on an IFRS basis.
As a result, the Group has not disclosed discrete financial information about any of the possible segments, which in any event would meet the criteria for aggregation under IFRS8, separately in these financial statements.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Labour and associated costs that have been incurred specifically on the Extra business centre conversions have been capitalised in leasehold improvements and are being depreciated over the lesser of 10 years or the number of years remaining on the lease.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
76 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial Statements Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 30 years Leasehold improvements lesser of the unexpired term of the lease and 50 years Plant and equipment 320 years Motor vehicles 4 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation expense is primarily charged in cost of sales with an immaterial amount in administrative expenses.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected, risk adjusted, future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Taxation Tax expense included in the Income Statement comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity, or to the extent it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax is provided using the Balance Sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets excluding goodwill and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill and the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that, following an assessment of the quantum and timing of future taxable profits, it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and the amount which is recognised is increased or reduced to the extent that it is then probable or no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax jurisdiction and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Segmental reporting The Group has considered the principles of IFRS8 as well as its internal reporting, management and operating structure.
The Directors conclusion is that the Group has a single reportable segment, that of wholesaling activities.
Other than the operation in India which is immaterial, all of the Groups revenue originates from the UK.
The functional currency of the Indian operation is Rupees.
The Group has no significant reliance on any individual customers.

Further reductions to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and to 18% effective 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.
The deferred tax asset at 25 March 2016 has been calculated based on these rates.
An additional reduction to 17% effective from 1 April 2020 was announced in the Budget on 16 March 2016.
This, if enacted, will reduce the groups future current tax charge and the value of its deferred tax asset accordingly.
Earnings per share a Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to the owners of the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.

Business combination On 14 September 2015, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Musgrave Retail Partners GB Limited and its subsidiaries Budgens and Londis for 40m on a cash debt free basis with a normalised working capital level.
This resulted in overall consideration of 110.9m being the sum of 40.0m plus net cash acquired of 66.4m and a working capital adjustment of 4.5m.
Originally, it was acquired by Booker Group plc, but this was subsequently transferred to Booker Wholesale Holdings Ltd.
Through Booker, Budgens and Londis coming together, the Group seeks to become the UKs leading wholesaler to independent retailers by: combining the best ranges from Booker, Budgens and Londis to improve the overall choice: consolidating buying volumes to improve prices for customers: and better utilisation of the supply chain network to reduce costs.

The goodwill is underpinned by the synergies that the Group is expected to obtain from improved cost prices from suppliers and logistics efficiencies.
None of the goodwill recognised will be deductible for tax purposes.
In the 28 weeks to 25 March 2016, BRP contributed turnover of 340.9m and, a loss before synergies and accounting policy alignment before interest, tax and exceptional items of 7.5m.
Turnover for the 52 weeks to 25 March 2016 was 680.0m with a loss before synergies and accounting policy alignment before interest, tax and exceptional items of 9.7m.

During the prior period, the Group paid 1m, with a further 1m of contingent consideration payable in accordance with the procurement agreement with Provenance Too Limited which holds the intellectual property in Provenance Limited.
Provenance Too Limited has no other assets or liabilities and the entire consideration has been classified as know-how, since the Group has acquired expertise in the sourcing and supply of Fruit and vegetables.
Under IAS36 Impairment of Assets, the Group is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.
Impairment reviews compare the carrying value of goodwill, other intangible fixed assets and net operating assets contained in each cash generating unit CGU with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is considered to be its value in use, calculated by reference to the pre-tax cash flow projections of each CGU based on the Groups approved budget for 2017 and three year plan to 2019.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated into perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2% 2015: 2%, being the Directors estimated view of the long term compound growth in the economy.
This is considered appropriate because the CGU is considered to be a long term business.
The discount rate used reflects the market assumptions for the risk free rate and equity risk premium and also takes into account the cost of debt.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows were based include the level of sales, gross margin and expenses within the business and have been set by the Directors based on their past experience of the business and its industry together with their expectations of the market.
The level of sales depends upon the size of the markets in which the Group operates together with the Directors estimations of its market share and competitive pressures.
Gross margin is dependent upon the net costs to the business of purchasing products together with the level of supplier rebates and income to support sales activities.
Expenses are based on the current cost base of the Group adjusted for variable costs and known plans for the business.

Intangible assets continued The Directors believe that three CGUs exist within the Group: a Ritter goodwill allocated 12.5m 2015: 12.5m A pre tax discount rate of 9.4% 2015: 9.7% has been applied to the projected cash flows.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions.
With all other assumptions held constant, neither a 10% increase in the pre-tax discount rate, nor a decline in growth of 10% into perpetuity, would require an impairment to be made.
b Budgens and Londis goodwill allocated 3.1m 2015: n a A pre tax discount rate of 12.0% has been applied to the projected cash flows.
c Remaining business goodwill allocated 448.9m 2015: 423.9m A pre tax discount rate of 9.5% 2015: 9.7% has been applied to the projected cash flows.
Last year, the Directors identified Makro as a CGU.
Over the last 12 months this business has been fully integrated into the Booker network, with customers being moved between branches to ensure the most efficient result for the Group and the customer.
It is therefore no longer considered to be a CGU as it does not generate independent cash inflows.
The Directors believe that the assumptions on which the carrying value of intangible and net operating assets is supported are reasonable and that no impairment is required.

Financial instruments Details of significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2.
The book value and fair value of the financial instruments are as follows: Book value Fair value 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m Financial assets Loans and other receivables 121.6 74.4 121.6 74.4 Cash and cash equivalents 127.4 147.0 127.4 147.0 249.0 221.4 249.0 221.4 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables 616.6 542.7 616.6 542.7 Property guarantees 1.0 5.0 1.0 5.0 617.6 547.7 617.6 547.7 Loans and other receivables represent amounts receivable from the sale of goods, together with amounts due from supplier rebates see note 15 and are initially measured at fair value and then subsequently held at amortised cost.
Fair value of property guarantees have been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity and risk of each guarantee crystallising.
Fair value hierarchy The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value, into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine fair value: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m 2016 Financial assets 249.0 249.0 Financial liabilities 617.6 617.6 2015 Financial assets 221.4 221.4 Financial liabilities 547.7 547.7 There have been no transfers between categories during the period.

Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group will finance operations and growth from existing cash resources, finance leases and committed borrowing facilities to ensure the constant availability of an appropriate amount of reasonably priced funding to meet both current and future forecast requirements.
The revolving credit facility bears floating interest rates linked to LIBOR plus a margin of 0.8%.
In the event of default of covenants on the bank facility, any drawn facility and any interest accrued are repayable on demand.
2016 2015 m m Facility available 120.0 120.0 Bank guarantees 7.0 Undrawn facility available 120.0 113.0 The following is an analysis of the undiscounted contractual cash flows payable under financial liabilities: Due within Due between Due between Due between Over 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 3 years 3 and 4 years 4 years m m m m m 2016 Trade and other payables 616.6 2015 Trade and other payables 542.7 It is not possible to quantify the timing of the cash flows relating to the property guarantees.
The undiscounted cash flows for borrowings differ from their carrying value in the balance sheet due to the inclusion of contractual interest payments and the adjustment for non-cash items including unamortised borrowing costs.
The undiscounted cash flows for financial instruments reflect the amounts payable on these instruments which differs from the fair value recorded on the balance sheet.
There is no difference between the discounted and undiscounted cash flows associated with trade payables due to their short term nature.
Credit risk The Group is predominantly a cash sales business with low levels of trade receivables in comparison to total sales for the year and has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
The Group has an accounting policy to provide for certain overdue trade receivables based on past experience, and believe that there are no significant unprovided overdue financial assets.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is relatively small to the Group, as there are no fixed borrowings and the revolving credit facility is only partially drawn for a small part of the year.
Therefore the Group has chosen not to hedge its borrowings.
Capital risk The Groups objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: and to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In assessing the level of capital all components of equity are taken into account i. e. share capital and retained earnings.
The Group has 127.4m of net cash as at 25 March 2016 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Management of capital therefore focuses around its ability to generate cash from its operations.
88 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial Statements In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds.
The Group believes it is meeting its objectives for managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to make returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
Foreign currency risk Less than 1% of purchases are denominated in foreign currencies.
The majority of sales are denominated in sterling, with the exception of sales made from the Groups Indian operation which are denominated in rupees.
The Directors do not consider that the Group has significant exposure to movements in foreign exchange and the Group does not hold any foreign exchange contracts.
Post employment benefits The Group operates a variety of post employment benefit arrangements, covering both funded defined benefit and funded defined contribution schemes to provide benefits to both full-time and part-time employees.
Defined contribution schemes Pension contributions of 6.4m 2015: 5.3m were charged to defined contribution schemes in the period.
Included within accruals is 0.5m 2015: 0.4m of outstanding pension contributions.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes, the assets of which are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet future benefit payments.
The main Group pension scheme is the Booker Pension Scheme the Booker Scheme, a funded defined benefit pension arrangement based on final salary and which was closed to new entrants in 2001 with benefits ceasing to accrue from 2002.
However, active members benefits retain a link to their final salaries.
On 14 September 2015 the Group acquired Musgrave Retail Partners GB Limited, which operates the Budgens Pension Scheme the Budgens Scheme and the Londis Pension Scheme the Londis Scheme, both trust based occupational defined benefit pension schemes.
The Londis Scheme was closed to new entrants in 1991 and future benefit accrual in 2009.
The Budgens Scheme closed to both new entrants and future accrual in 2010, albeit active members benefits retain a link to their final salaries.
The benefit obligations as at 25 March 2016 have been calculated by an independent actuary on an IAS19 basis, by rolling forward from the results of the latest actuarial funding valuation, which is 31 March 2013, 31 March 2015 and 1 April 2014 for the Booker Scheme, the Budgens Scheme and the Londis Scheme respectively.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method.
a Major assumptions used by the actuary weighted average 2016 2015 Discount rate 3.50% 3.40% RPI inflation 3.00% 2.95% CPI inflation 2.00% 1.95% Rate of increase in salaries 2.00% 1.95% Pension increases in payment 2.95% 2.90% The average life expectancy in years of a member is as follows: 2016 2015 Aged 65 retiring immediately current pensioner Male 21.6 21.5 Female 23.9 23.7 Aged 40 retiring at 65 future pensioner Male 23.4 22.7 Female 25.8 25.1 At 25 March 2016, the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is approximately 16 years.

h Contributions to be paid Booker Scheme the last actuarial funding valuation was carried out at 31 March 2013, which revealed a shortfall of approximately 24m.
This shortfall was expected to be recovered through Company deficit contributions 9.6m paid in the year ending 31 March 2014 and 2.4m paid in the year ending 31 March 2015 and the returns achievable on the assets of the Scheme.
No contributions have been paid over this period.
The contribution schedule will be reviewed following next actuarial valuation of the Booker Scheme, which is scheduled for 31 March 2016.
Budgens Scheme the last actuarial funding valuation was carried out at 31 March 2015, which revealed a nil shortfall at this date.
Londis Scheme the last actuarial funding valuation was carried out at 1 April 2014, which revealed a shortfall of 0.5 million at this date.
This shortfall is expected to be recovered through returns on the scheme assets, and no contributions are required.
