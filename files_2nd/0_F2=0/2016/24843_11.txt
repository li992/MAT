qxp XXXX 25 05 2016 11:16 Page 32 Section 2: Strategic Report continued Corporation Tax Rate Sensitivity The profits of each UK project company are subject to UK corporation tax.
The UK corporation tax assumption for the portfolio valuation is 20% until March 2017, 19% to March 2020 and 18% thereafter, which is a reduction from the flat rate of 20% assumed at March 2015, to reflect the legal enactment of the prospective changes to the rate of UK corporation tax.
These rate changes, partially offset by more conservative assumptions in light of potential changes to tax rules, have resulted in a slight increase to the portfolio valuation, which is netted off within the 18.7m aggregate reduction in portfolio value attributable to changes in Economic Assumptions.
The tax sensitivity looks at the effect on the Directors valuation and the NAV per share of changing the tax rates by - 5% each year and is provided to show that tax can be a material variable in the valuation of investments.
The analysis to prepare this sensitivity was carried out on the 20 largest investments as at 31 March 2016.
