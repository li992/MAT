Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Preparation These consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union.
International Financial Reporting Standards are issued by the International Accounting Standard Board IASB.

154 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report & Accounts 2016 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Basis of Preparation continued The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
Exceptions include, but are not limited to, property, plant and equipment at the date of transition to IFRS accounted for at deemed cost, available-forsale investments measured at fair value, assets classified as held for sale measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and post-employment benefits measured at present value.
Going Concern These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Groups activities in all of its operating segments continue to be affected by the uncertainty and instability of the current economic environment Note 30.
In response, the Group implemented a number of cost cutting initiatives, reduced capital expenditures, continues to reduce the level of debt and proactively manages its debt covenants compliance.
Based on the currently available facts and circumstances the directors and management have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Restatement of Financial Statements Reclassification of Expenses In 2016, the Group reclassified property tax accrued and paid by the production subsidiaries from general and administrative expenses to the cost of revenue caption.
In addition, the Group reclassified staff costs of certain categories of personnel and the related expenses from cost of revenues and selling expenses to general and administrative expenses and from selling expenses to cost of revenues.
The reclassifications were made to better reflect the nature of these costs in the current business environment and in order to make the financial statements more comparable with industry peers.
The effects of the restatement on the previously reported amounts are set out below.
Year ended 31 December 2015 As previously Other reported Property tax Staff costs expenses Restated Statement of Operations Cost of revenue $ 6,595 $ 27 $ 48 $ 9 $ 6,583 Gross profit 2,172 27 48 9 2,184 Selling and distribution costs 795 47 20 728 General and administrative expenses 474 27 95 11 553 Year ended 31 December 2014 As previously Other reported Property tax Staff costs expenses Restated Statement of Operations Cost of revenue $ 9,734 $ 50 $ 58 $ 8 $ 9,734 Gross profit 3,327 50 58 8 3,327 Selling and distribution costs 1,009 60 19 930 General and administrative expenses 743 50 118 11 822 www.

Significant Accounting Policies continued Changes in Accounting Policies In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Group followed the same accounting policies and methods of computation as compared with those applied in the previous year, except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations and revision of the existing standards as of 1 January 2016.
New Revised Standards and Interpretations Adopted in 2016: Amendments to IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions IAS 19 requires an entity to consider contributions from employees or third parties when accounting for defined benefit plans.
Where the contributions are linked to service, they should be attributed to periods of service as a negative benefit.
This amendment is not relevant to the Group, since none of the entities within the Group has defined benefit plans with contributions from employees.
Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative The amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements clarify existing IAS 1 requirements: The materiality requirements in IAS 1 The requirements that apply when additional subtotals are presented in the statement of financial position and the statements of profit or loss and OCI That specific line items in the statements of profit or loss and OCI and the statement of financial position may be disaggregated That entities have flexibility as to the order in which they present the notes to financial statements That the share of OCI of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method must be presented in aggregate as a single line item, and classified between those items that will or will not be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss.
Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations The amendments to IFRS 11 require that a joint operator accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation, in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business, must apply the relevant IFRS 3 principles for business combinations accounting.
The amendments also clarify that a previously held interest in a joint operation is not remeasured on the acquisition of an additional interest in the same joint operation while joint control is retained.
In addition, a scope exclusion has been added to IFRS 11 to specify that the amendments do not apply when the parties sharing joint control, including the reporting entity, are under common control of the same ultimate controlling party.
The amendments apply to both the acquisition of the initial interest in a joint operation and the acquisition of any additional interests in the same joint operation and are prospectively effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted.
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation The amendments clarify the principle in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that revenue reflects a pattern of economic benefits that are generated from operating a business of which the asset is part rather than the economic benefits that are consumed through use of the asset.
As a result, a revenue-based method cannot be used to depreciate property, plant and equipment and may only be used in very limited circumstances to amortise intangible assets.
156 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report & Accounts 2016 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Changes in Accounting Policies continued Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 Bearer Plants The amendments change the accounting requirements for biological assets that meet the definition of bearer plants.
Under the amendments, biological assets that meet the definition of bearer plants will no longer be within the scope of IAS 41.
After initial recognition, bearer plants will be measured under IAS 16 at accumulated cost before maturity and using either the cost model or revaluation model after maturity.
The amendments also require that produce that grows on bearer plants will remain in the scope of IAS 41 measured at fair value less costs to sell.
For government grants related to bearer plants, IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance will apply.
The amendments are retrospectively effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
These amendments do not have any impact to the Group as the Group does not have any bearer plants.
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exemption The amendments address issues that have arisen in applying the investment entities exception under IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
The amendments to IFRS 10 clarify that the exemption from presenting consolidated financial statements applies to a parent entity that is a subsidiary of an investment entity, when the investment entity measures all of its subsidiaries at fair value.
Furthermore, the amendments to IFRS 10 clarify that only a subsidiary of an investment entity that is not an investment entity itself and that provides support services to the investment entity is consolidated.
All other subsidiaries of an investment entity are measured at fair value.
The amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures allow the investor, when applying the equity method, to retain the fair value measurement applied by the investment entity associate or joint venture to its interests in subsidiaries.
These amendments are applied retrospectively and do not have any impact on the Group as the Group does not apply the consolidation exception.
Amendments to IAS 27 Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements The amendments allow entities to use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in their separate financial statements.
Entities already applying IFRS and electing to change to the equity method in its separate financial statements will have to apply that change retrospectively.
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle The amendments relate to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IFRS 8 Operating Segments, IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets, IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures.
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle The amendments relate to IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IAS 19 Employee Benefits, IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.
The amendments described above had no significant impact on the financial position and performance of the Group or the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.

Significant Accounting Policies continued Changes in Accounting Policies continued Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective in the European Union Standards not yet effective for the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative 1 January 2017 1 Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses 1 January 2017 1 Amendments to IAS 40 Transfers of Investment Property 1 January 2018 1 Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions 1 January 2018 1 Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts 1 January 2018 1 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 1 IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration 1 January 2018 1 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 1 Subject to EU endorsement The Group expects that the adoption of the pronouncements listed above will not have a significant impact on the Groups results of operations and financial position in the period of initial application.
The Group plans to apply IFRS 15, IFRS 16 and IFRS 9 starting from the dates effective in the European Union.
At present the Group is in the process of analysis of the possible impact of the application of these standards on its consolidated financial statements, but the preliminary results show that the impact will not be significant.
Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates Accounting Judgements In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, apart from those involving estimates, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements: In 2015, the Group lost control over Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited and it is not expected that it will re-obtain control in the future.
As a result, the Group ceased to consolidate this entity starting 14 April 2015 Note 4.
The Group determined based on the criteria in IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease that the supply contract with PraxAir does not contain a lease.
This contract, concluded in 2010, with subsequent amendments in 2015, included the construction of an air separation plant by PraxAir to be owned and operated by PraxAir and the supply of oxygen and other industrial gases produced by PraxAir to EVRAZ Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Plant for a period of 25 years on a take or pay basis.
In 2015, the air separation plant was put into operation and the Group started to purchase gases from PraxAir.
Management believes that this arrangement does not convey a right to the Group to use the asset as the Group does not have an ability to operate the asset or to direct other parties to operate the asset: it does not control physical access to the asset: and it is expected that more than an insignificant amount of the assets output will be sold to the parties unrelated to the Group.
The commitment under this contract is disclosed in Note 30.

Significant Accounting Policies continued Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates continued Estimation Uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets.
In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Group recognised a net impairment loss of $151 million, $190 million and $192 million, respectively Note 9.
The determination of impairments of property, plant and equipment involves the use of estimates that include, but are not limited to, the cause, timing and amount of the impairment.
Impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive conditions, expectations of growth in the industry, increased cost of capital, changes in the future availability of financing, technological obsolescence, discontinuance of service, current replacement costs and other changes in circumstances that indicate that impairment exists.
The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit involves the use of estimates by management.
Methods used to determine the value in use include discounted cash flow-based methods, which require the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
These estimates, including the methodologies used, may have a material impact on the value in use and, ultimately, the amount of any impairment.
Useful Lives of Items of Property, Plant and Equipment The Group assesses the remaining useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment at least at each financial year end and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.
These estimates may have a material impact on the amount of the carrying values of property, plant and equipment and on depreciation expense for the period.
com 159 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates continued Estimation Uncertainty continued Impairment of Goodwill The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 December 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $880 million, $1,176 million and $1,541 million, respectively.
In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Group recognised an impairment loss in respect of goodwill in the amount of $316 million, $251 million and $330 million, respectively Note 5.
More details of the assumptions used in estimating the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated are provided in Note 6.
Mineral Reserves Mineral reserves and the associated mine plans are a material factor in the Groups computation of a depletion charge.
The Group estimates its mineral reserves in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves JORC Code.
Estimation of reserves in accordance with the JORC Code involves some degree of uncertainty.
The uncertainty depends mainly on the amount of reliable geological and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of this data, which also requires use of subjective judgement and development of assumptions.
Mine plans are periodically updated which can have a material impact on the depletion charge for the period.
Site Restoration Provisions The Group reviews site restoration provisions at each reporting date and adjusts them to reflect the current best estimate in accordance with IFRIC 1 Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditures required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period based on the requirements of the current legislation of the country where the respective operating assets are located.
The carrying amount of a provision is the present value of the expected expenditures, i. e. cash outflows discounted using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances are taken into account in reaching the best estimate of a provision.
Considerable judgement is required in forecasting future site restoration costs.
Future events that may affect the amount required to settle an obligation are reflected in the amount of a provision when there is sufficient objective evidence that they will occur.
160 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report & Accounts 2016 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates continued Estimation Uncertainty continued Post-Employment Benefits The Group uses an actuarial valuation method for the measurement of the present value of post-employment benefit obligations and related current service cost.
This involves the use of demographic assumptions about the future characteristics of the current and former employees who are eligible for benefits mortality, both during and after employment, rates of employee turnover, disability and early retirement, etc.
as well as financial assumptions discount rate, future salary and benefit levels, expected rate of return on plan assets, etc.. More details are provided in Note 23.
Allowances The Group makes allowances for doubtful receivables to account for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments.
When evaluating the adequacy of an allowance for doubtful accounts, management bases its estimates on the current overall economic conditions, the ageing of accounts receivable balances, historical write-off experience, customer creditworthiness and changes in payment terms.
Changes in the economy, industry or specific customer conditions may require adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
As of 31 December 2016, 2015 and 2014, allowances for doubtful accounts in respect of trade and other receivables have been made in the amount of $47 million, $48 million and $57 million, respectively Note 28.
The Group makes an allowance for obsolete and slow-moving raw materials and spare parts.
In addition, certain finished goods of the Group are carried at net realisable value Note 14.
Estimates of net realisable value of finished goods are based on the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates are made.
These estimates take into consideration fluctuations of price or cost directly relating to events occurring subsequent to the end of the reporting period to the extent that such events confirm conditions existing at the end of the period.
Deferred Income Tax Assets Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
The estimation of that probability includes judgements based on the expected performance.
Various factors are considered to assess the probability of the future utilisation of deferred tax assets, including past operating results, operational plans, expiration of tax losses carried forward, and tax planning strategies.
If actual results differ from these estimates or if these estimates must be adjusted in future periods, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.
In the event that the assessment of future utilisation of deferred tax assets must be reduced, this reduction will be recognised in the statement of operations.
com 161 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates continued Foreign Currency Transactions The presentation currency of the Group is the US dollar because presentation in US dollars is most relevant for the major current and potential users of the consolidated financial statements.
The functional currencies of the Groups subsidiaries are the Russian rouble, US dollar, euro, Czech koruna, South African rand, Canadian dollar and Ukrainian hryvnia.
At the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the US dollar are translated into the presentation currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period, and their statements of operations are translated at the exchange rates that approximate the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
The exchange differences arising on the translation are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a subsidiary with functional currency other than the US dollar, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular subsidiary is recognised in the statement of operations.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period.
All resulting differences are taken to the statement of operations.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
162 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report & Accounts 2016 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Basis of Consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries, which are those entities in which the Group has an interest of more than 50% of the voting rights and over which the Group has control, or otherwise has power to exercise control over their operations, are consolidated.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases.
All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated: unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Where necessary, accounting policies for subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Non-controlling interest is the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent.
Non-controlling interests are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, separately from the parents shareholders equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Acquisition of Subsidiaries Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the Group measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.
The initial accounting for a business combination involves identifying and determining the fair values to be assigned to the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the cost of the combination.
If the initial accounting for a business combination can be determined only provisionally by the end of the period in which the combination is effected because either the fair values to be assigned to the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities or the cost of the combination can be determined only provisionally, the Group accounts for the combination using those provisional values.
The Group recognises any adjustments to those provisional values as a result of completing the initial accounting within twelve months of the acquisition date.
Comparative information presented for the periods before the completion of initial accounting for the acquisition is presented as if the initial accounting had been completed from the acquisition date.
com 163 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Basis of Consolidation continued Increases in Ownership Interests in Subsidiaries The differences between the carrying values of net assets attributable to interests in subsidiaries acquired and the consideration given for such increases is either added to additional paid-in capital, if positive, or charged to accumulated profits, if negative, in the consolidated financial statements.
Purchases of Controlling Interests in Subsidiaries from Entities under Common Control Purchases of controlling interests in subsidiaries from entities under common control are accounted for using the pooling of interests method.
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiary transferred under common control are recorded in these financial statements at the historical cost of the controlling entity the Predecessor.
Related goodwill inherent in the Predecessors original acquisition is also recorded in the financial statements.
Any difference between the total book value of net assets, including the Predecessors goodwill, and the consideration paid is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements as an adjustment to the shareholders equity.
These financial statements, including corresponding figures, are presented as if a subsidiary had been acquired by the Group on the date it was originally acquired by the Predecessor.
Put Options over Non-controlling Interests The Group derecognises non-controlling interests if non-controlling shareholders have a put option over their holdings.
The difference between the amount of the liability recognised in the statement of financial position over the carrying value of the derecognised non-controlling interests is charged to accumulated profits.
Investments in Associates Associates are entities in which the Group generally has between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, or is otherwise able to exercise significant influence, but which it does not control or jointly control.
Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost including goodwill.
Subsequent changes in the carrying value reflect the post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate and goodwill impairment charges, if any.
The Groups share of its associates profits or losses is recognised in the statement of operations and its share of movements in reserves is recognised in equity.
However, when the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless the Group has legal or constructive obligations to make payments to, or on behalf of, the associate.
If the associate subsequently reports profits, the Group resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates: unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Interests in Joint Ventures The Groups interest in its joint ventures is accounted for under the equity method of accounting whereby an interest in jointly ventures is initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of joint ventures.
The statement of operations reflects the Groups share of the results of operations of joint ventures.
164 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report & Accounts 2016 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Property, Plant and Equipment The Groups property, plant and equipment is stated at purchase or construction cost, excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of plant and equipment when that cost is incurred and recognition criteria are met.
The Groups property, plant and equipment include mining assets, which consist of mineral reserves, mine development and construction costs and capitalised site restoration costs.
Mineral reserves represent tangible assets acquired in business combinations.
Mine development and construction costs represent expenditures incurred in developing access to mineral reserves and preparations for commercial production, including sinking shafts and underground drifts, roads, infrastructure, buildings, machinery and equipment.
At each end of the reporting period management makes an assessment to determine whether there is any indication of impairment of property, plant and equipment.
If any such indication exists, management estimates the recoverable amount, which is the higher of an assets fair value less cost to sell and its value in use.
The carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount, and the difference is recognised as impairment loss in the statement of operations or other comprehensive income.
An impairment loss recognised for an asset in previous years is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, except for mining assets, is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment and methods of their depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each fiscal year end.
The table below presents the useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.
Useful lives Weighted average remaining useful years life years Buildings and constructions 1560 21 Machinery and equipment 445 10 Transport and motor vehicles 720 5 Other assets 315 4 The Group determines the depreciation charge separately for each significant part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Depletion of mining assets including capitalised site restoration costs is calculated using the units-of-production method based upon proved and probable mineral reserves.
The depletion calculation takes into account future development costs for reserves which are in the production phase.
Maintenance costs relating to items of property, plant and equipment are expensed as incurred.
Major renewals and improvements are capitalised, and the replaced assets are derecognised.
The Group has the title to certain non-production and social assets, primarily buildings and facilities of social infrastructure, which are carried at their recoverable amount of zero.
The costs to maintain such assets are expensed as incurred.
com 165 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Exploration and Evaluation Expenditures Exploration and evaluation expenditures represent costs incurred by the Group in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable.
The expenditures include acquisition of rights to explore, topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies, exploratory drilling, trenching, sampling, activities in relation to evaluating the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting mineral resources.
These costs are expensed as incurred.
When the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable, the Group commences recognition of expenditures related to the development of mineral resources as assets.
These assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date as to whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised from the commencement of the lease term at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged to interest expense.
The depreciation policy for depreciable leased assets is consistent with that for depreciable assets which are owned.
If there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or its useful life.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred for an acquisition of a subsidiary or an associte and the amount recognised for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the acquiree, the difference is recognised in the consolidated statement of operations.
Goodwill on acquisition of a subsidiary is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisition of an associate is included in the carrying amount of the investments in associates.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, or the group of cash-generating units, to which the goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
166 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report & Accounts 2016 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Goodwill continued Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative fair values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Expenditures on internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are expensed as incurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite life are reviewed at least at each year end.
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, they are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash-generating unit level.
The table below presents the useful lives of intangible assets.
Useful lives Weighted average remaining useful years life years Customer relationships 115 7 Contract terms 10 7 Other 519 7 Certain water rights and environmental permits are considered to have indefinite lives as management believes that these rights will continue indefinitely.
The most part of the Groups intangible assets represents customer relationships arising on business combinations Note 10.
Financial Assets The Group classified its investments into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-tomaturity, and available-for-sale.
When investments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Group determines the classification of its investments after initial recognition.
Investments that are acquired principally for the purpose of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price are classified as held for trading and included in the category financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments which are included in this category are subsequently carried at fair value: gains or losses on such investments are recognised in income.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
com 167 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Financial Assets continued Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity.
Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective yield method.
Investments intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, are classified as available-for-sale: these are included in non-current assets unless management has the express intention of holding the investment for less than 12 months from the end of the reporting period or unless they will need to be sold to raise operating capital, in which case they are included in current assets.
Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of the purchase and re-evaluates such designation on a regular basis.
After initial recognition available-for-sale investments are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the statement of operations.
Reversals of impairment losses in respect of equity instruments are not recognised in the statement of operations.
Impairment losses in respect of debt instruments are reversed through profit or loss if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the statement of operations.
For investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets, fair value is determined by reference to stock exchange quoted market bid prices at the close of business on the end of the reporting period.
For investments where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques.
Such techniques include using recent arms length market transactions, reference to the current market value of another instrument, which is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other generally accepted valuation techniques.
All purchases and sales of financial assets under contracts to purchase or sell financial assets that require delivery of the asset within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place are recognised on the settlement date i. e. the date the asset is delivered by to the counterparty.
Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, which generally are short-term, are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment of accounts receivable that represents its estimate of incurred losses.
The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar receivables in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Inventories Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost of inventory is determined on the weighted average basis and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring or producing inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
168 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report & Accounts 2016 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Value Added Tax The tax authorities permit the settlement of sales and purchases value added tax VAT on a net basis.
The Groups subsidiaries apply the accrual method for VAT recognition, under which VAT becomes payable upon invoicing and delivery of goods or rendering services as well upon receipt of prepayments from customers.
VAT on purchases, even if not settled at the end of the reporting period, is deducted from the amount of VAT payable.
Where provision has been made for impairment of receivables, an impairment loss is recorded for the gross amount of the debtor, including VAT.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method: any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption amount is recognised as interest expense over the period of the borrowings.
Borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets are capitalised Note 9.
Equity Share Capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown as a deduction in equity from the proceeds.
Any excess of the fair value of consideration received over the par value of shares issued is recognised as additional paid-in capital.
Treasury Shares Own equity instruments which are acquired by the Group treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in statement of operations on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the treasury shares.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity only if they are declared before the end of the reporting period.
Dividends are disclosed when they are proposed before the end of the reporting period or proposed or declared after the end of the reporting period but before the financial statements are authorised for issue.
com 169 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Provisions for site restoration costs are capitalised within property, plant and equipment.
Employee Benefits Social and Pension Contributions Defined contributions are made by the Group to the Russian and Ukrainian state pension, social insurance and medical insurance funds at the statutory rates in force based on gross salary payments.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions in respect of those benefits.
Its only obligation is to pay contributions as they fall due.
These contributions are expensed as incurred.
Defined Benefit Plans The Group companies provide pensions and other benefits to their employees Note 23.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the completion of a minimum service period.
Certain benefit plans require the employee to remain in service up to retirement age.
Other employee benefits consist of various compensations and non-monetary benefits.
The amounts of benefits are stipulated in the collective bargaining agreements and or in the plan documents.
The Group involves independent qualified actuaries in the measurement of employee benefit obligations.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method.
Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding net interest and the return on plan assets excluding net interest, are recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of the date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and the date that the Group recognises  costs.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
It is recorded within interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
The Group recognises current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements in the consolidated statement of operations within cost of sales, general and administrative expenses and selling and distribution expenses.
Other Costs The Group incurs employee costs related to the provision of benefits such as health services, kindergartens and other services.
These amounts principally represent an implicit cost of employment and, accordingly, have been charged to cost of sales.

Significant Accounting Policies continued Share-based Payments The Group has management compensation schemes Note 21, under which certain senior executives and employees of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby they render services as consideration for equity instruments equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with grantees is measured by reference to the fair value of the Companys shares at the date on which they are granted.
The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any conditions, other than market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity additional paid-in capital, over the period in which service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant persons become fully entitled to the award the vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The charge or credit in the statement of operations for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Once a share-settled transaction is vested, no further accounting entries are made to reverse the cost already charged, even if the instruments that are the subject of the transaction are subsequently forfeited.
In this case, the Group makes a transfer between different components of equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
Cash-settled share-based payments represent transactions in which the Group acquires goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer cash or other assets to the supplier of those goods or services for amounts that are based on the price or value of the Groups shares or other equity instruments.
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured initially at fair value at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton model.
This fair value is expensed over the period until the vesting date with recognition of a corresponding liability.
The liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of operations.
The dilutive effect of outstanding share-based awards is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share Note 20. www.
com 171 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Sale of Goods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
The moment of transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership is determined by the contract terms.
Rendering of Services The Groups revenues from rendering of services include electricity, transportation, port and other services.
Revenue is recognised when services are rendered.
Interest Interest is recognised using the effective interest method.
Dividends Revenue is recognised when the shareholders right to receive the payment is established.
Rental Income Rental income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term on ongoing leases.
Current Income Tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income or equity and not in the statement of operations.
Deferred Income Tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using the liability method.
Deferred income taxes are provided for all temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes, except where the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Segment Information For management purposes the Group has four reportable operating segments: Steel segment includes production of steel and related products at all mills except for those located in North America.
Extraction of vanadium ore and production of vanadium products, iron ore mining and enrichment and certain energy-generating companies are also included in this segment as they are closely related to the main process of steel production.
Steel, North America is a segment, which includes production of steel and related products in the USA and Canada.
Coal segment includes coal mining and enrichment.
It also includes operations of Nakhodka Trade Sea Port as it is used to a significant extent for shipping of products of the coal segment to the Asian markets.
Other operations include energy-generating companies, shipping and railway transportation companies.
Management and investment companies are not allocated to any of the segments.
Operating segments have been aggregated into reportable segments if they show a similar long-term economic performance, have comparable production processes, customer industries and distribution channels, operate in the same regulatory environment, and are generally managed and monitored together.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Management monitors the results of the operating segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segment performance is evaluated based on EBITDA see below.
This performance indicator is calculated based on management accounts that differ from the IFRS consolidated financial statements for the following reasons: 1 for the last month of the reporting period, the management accounts for each operating segment are prepared using a forecast for that month: 2 the statement of operations is based on local GAAP figures with the exception of depreciation and repair expenses which are adjusted to approximate the amount under IFRS: 3 in case of volatility of functional currencies the IFRS statements of operations are translated at the exchange rates that approximate the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions quarterly, semi-annual averages, etc.
while in management accounts simple average for the whole accounting period is used.
Segment revenue is revenue reported in the Groups statement of operations that is directly attributable to a segment and the relevant portion of the Groups revenue that can be allocated to it on a reasonable basis, whether from sales to external customers or from transactions with other segments.
Segment expense is expense resulting from the operating activities of a segment that is directly attributable to the segment and the relevant portion of an expense that can be allocated to it on a reasonable basis, including expenses relating to external counterparties and expenses relating to transactions with other segments.
Segment expense does not include social and social infrastructure maintenance expenses.
Segment result is segment revenue less segment expense that is equal to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA for that segment.
Segment EBITDA is determined as a segments profit loss from operations adjusted for social and social infrastructure maintenance expenses, impairment of assets, profit loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, foreign exchange gains losses and depreciation, depletion and amortisation expense.
Management believes that this measure is more useful and relevant for the users and is more comparable with the Russian steel peers.

Changes in Composition of the Group Deconsolidation of Subsidiaries Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited On 13 April 2015, as a result of severe economic difficulties due to the current and persistent unfavourable economic environment in South Africa, the Board of Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited Highveld decided to place the entity under the business rescue procedures to avoid its liquidation and to avoid giving Highvelds creditors the opportunity to apply for its liquidation in court.
The rescue procedures will result either in 1 Highveld being re-financed or financially restructured or, if that is not possible, 2 Highvelds orderly winding down under the supervision of a business rescue practitioner to maximise the return to creditors and other affected parties.
Following the placement of Highveld under the business rescue procedures, control and management of Highveld was transferred to a business rescue practitioner.
Until Highveld is successfully re-financed restructured, Highvelds Board and the Group are no longer able to control Highveld or exercise significant influence over it.
The business rescue practitioner can consult with the Highvelds Board or its directors, but he would not be bound by any requests or advice from Highvelds Board or the directors.

Changes in Composition of the Group continued Deconsolidation of Subsidiaries continued Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited continued The Groups management believe that due to the current market conditions the option to invest additional cash in Highveld to pay to the creditors and to stop business rescue procedures would create no economic value for the Group.
Therefore, in the opinion of management, the potential voting rights that the Group has in Highveld have no economic substance.
Based on the managements current assessment, the business rescue procedures most likely will result in Highveld being sold to one or more third parties at a significant discount or being mandatorily liquidated.
As a consequence, management believes that on 14 April 2015 the date of the placement of Highveld under the business rescue procedures the Group lost control over Highveld and it is not expected that it will re-obtain control in the future.
As a result, the Group ceased to consolidate Highveld starting 14 April 2015 and recognised a loss on disposal of a subsidiary in the amount of $167 million, including $142 million of translation loss recycled to the statement of operations.
In addition, non-controlling interests of $4 million were derecognised.
Management analysed the classification of Highveld to determine whether its disposal constitutes a discontinued operation under IFRS 5 and concluded that this is not the case.
The table below demonstrates the carrying values of assets and liabilities of Highveld, which were included in the steel segment of the Groups operations, at the date of derecognition.

Impairment of Assets continued The Group recognised the impairment losses as a result of the impairment testing at the level of cash-generating units.
In addition, the Group made a write-off of certain functionally obsolete items of property, plant and equipment and recorded an impairment relating to VAT with a long-term recovery.
For the purpose of the impairment testing the Group assessed the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which the goodwill was allocated or where indicators of impairment were identified.
Given the market volatility, in 2015 and 2014 the impairment test was performed as of 31 December in the respective years.
In 2016, impairment test was performed as of 30 September, the conclusions were reassessed at 31 December and no further impairment triggers were identified.
In the first half of 2016, based on the analysis of market changes and cash inflow dependence between the assets and new business organisational structure, management reassessed the composition of cash generating units of Steel North America for the purposes of impairment testing.
The assets of EVRAZ Inc. NA and EVRAZ Inc. NA Canada, which were previously allocated to cash-generating units based on individual plant level, were merged into 5 new units based on principal markets served by each cash-generating unit: Large diameter pipes: Oil Country Tubular Goods casing and tubing : Seamless pipes: Flat rolled products plates and coils : Long products rails, rod and bar products.
The recoverable amounts have been determined based on calculation of either value-in-use or fair value less costs to sell.
Both valuation techniques used cash flow projections based on the actual operating results and business plans approved by management and appropriate discount rates reflecting the time value of money and risks associated with respective cash-generating units.
For the periods not covered by management business plans, cash flow projections have been estimated by extrapolating the results of the respective business plans using a zero real growth rate.
In the determination of fair value less costs to sell the assets value additionally includes the cashflows of future projects not started yet and the associated capital expenditure costs.
The major drivers that led to impairment were the changes in expectations of long-term prices for iron ore and steel products, the increase in forecasted costs and changes in forecasted production volumes.
Management lowered their forecasts for periods after 2016, because the expectations of market recovery in North America changed.
The key assumptions used by management in the value-in-use calculations with respect to the cash-generating units to which the goodwill was allocated are presented in the table below.

Impairment of Assets continued In addition, the Group determined that there were indicators of impairment in other cash generating units and tested them for impairment using the following assumptions.
Average price of commodity per Period of forecast, Pre-tax discount tonne years rate, % Commodity in 2017 EVRAZ Dneprovsk Metallurgical Plant 5 23.5 steel products $312 EVRAZ Consolidated West-Siberian Metallurgical Plant 5 15.01 steel products $314 EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli 8 15.70 steel products 480 EVRAZ Stratcor Inc. 5 12.62 vanadium products $33,803 Raspadskaya 18 12.71 coal $51 Mezhegeyugol 25 11.88 coal $58 EVRAZ Kachkanarsky  Integrated Works 23 13.88 ore $37 EVRAZ Sukha Balka 17 24.92 ore $24 Evrazruda - Sheregesh mine 10 16.64 ore $40 The value in use of the cash-generating units for which an impairment loss was recognised or reversed in the reporting year was as follows: 30 September 31 December US$ million 2016 2015 Oil Country Tubular Goods 362 Seamless pipes 25 169 Flat rolled products 294 EVRAZ Stratcor Inc. 20 45 EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli 24 5 The value in use of Oil Country Tubular Goods and Flat rolled products at 31 December 2015 has not been disclosed, because of the changes in the composition of North-American cash-generating units in 2016.
Similarly the value in use as disclosed in the 31 December 2015 financial statements has not been re-presented as it is no longer directly comparable.
At 31 December 2015, management expected to recover investments in EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli principally through sale and the recoverable amount of this cash-generating unit was measured at $5 million as fair value less costs of disposal, which was determined based on non-binding offers at 31 December 2015 Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
com 185 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 6.
Impairment of Assets continued The estimations of value in use are most sensitive to the following assumptions: Discount Rates Discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit.
The discount rates have been determined using the Capital Asset Pricing Model and analysis of industry peers.
Reasonably possible changes in discount rates could lead to an additional impairment at EVRAZ Stratcor Inc. EVRAZ Inc. NA and EVRAZ Inc. NA Canada cash-generating units.
If discount rates were 10% higher, this would lead to an additional impairment of $120 million.
Sales Prices The price assumptions for the products sold by the Group were estimated based on industry research using analysts views published by Bank of America Merill Lynch, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, RBC, Renaissance Capital, UBS and VTB during the period from August to December 2016.
The Group expects that the nominal prices will fluctuate with a compound annual growth rate of 6.6 % - 9.9% in 2017 2021, 2.5% in 2022 and thereafter.
Reasonably possible changes in sales prices could lead to an additional impairment at EVRAZ Sukha Balka, EVRAZ Stratcor Inc. EVRAZ Inc. NA and EVRAZ Inc. NA Canada cash-generating units.
If the prices assumed for 2017 and 2018 in the impairment test were 10% lower, this would lead to an additional impairment of $37 million.
Sales Volumes Management assumed that the sales volumes of steel products in 2017 will increase by 7.6% and future dynamics will be driven by a gradual market recovery and changes in assets capacities.
Reasonably possible changes in sales volumes could lead to an additional impairment at EVRAZ Stratcor Inc. EVRAZ Inc. NA and EVRAZ Inc. NA Canada cash-generating units.
If the sales volumes were 10% lower than those assumed for 2017 and 2018 in the impairment test, this would lead to an additional impairment of $12 million.
Cost Control Measures The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on the business plans approved by management.
A reasonably possible deviation in cost from these plans could lead to an additional impairment at EVRAZ Dneprovsk Metallurgical Plant, EVRAZ Sukha Balka, EVRAZ Nikom, EVRAZ Stratcor Inc. EVRAZ Inc. NA and EVRAZ Inc. NA Canada cash-generating units.
If the actual costs were 10% higher than those assumed for 2017 and 2018 in the impairment test, this would lead to an additional impairment of $139 million.

Income Taxes continued As of 31 December 2016, 2015 and 2014, deferred income taxes in respect of undistributed earnings of the Groups subsidiaries have not been provided for, as management does not intend to distribute accumulated earnings in the foreseeable future.
The current tax rate on intra-group dividend income varies from 0% to 15%.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries were not recognised as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and does not intend to reverse them in the foreseeable future.
In the context of the Groups current structure, tax losses and current tax assets of the different companies may not be set off against current tax liabilities and taxable profits of other companies in the same jurisdiction, except for the companies registered in Cyprus, Russia and the United Kingdom where group relief and tax consolidation can be applied.
As of 31 December 2016, the unused tax losses carried forward approximated $9,729 million 2015: $7,658 million, 2014: $8,060 million.
The Group recognised deferred tax assets of $226 million 2015: $208 million, 2014: $247 million in respect of unused tax losses.
Deferred tax assets in the amount of $2,329 million 2015: $1,895 million, 2014: $1,771 million have not been recorded as it is not probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the foreseeable future to offset these losses.
Tax losses of $8,593 million 2015: $6,642 million, 2014: $6,767 million for which deferred tax assets were not recognised arose in companies registered in Canada, Cyprus, Italy, Luxembourg, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the USA.
Losses in the amount of $8,549 million 2015: $6,410 million, 2014: $6,513 million are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose and $44 million will expire in 2018 2015: $232 million, 2014: $254 million.

On 1 January 2014, certain of the Groups subsidiaries reassessed the remaining useful lives of property, plant and equipment, which resulted in a $52 million decrease in depreciation expense as compared to the amounts that would have been charged had no change in estimate occurred.
Impairment losses were identified in respect of certain items of property, plant and equipment that were recognised as functionally obsolete or as a result of the testing at the level of cash-generating units Note 6.

Under the joint venture agreement major operating and financial decisions are made by unanimous consent of the Group and Alrosa, and no single venturer is in a position to control the activity unilaterally.
Consequently, the Group accounts for its interest in Timir under the equity method.
The Groups consideration for this stake amounted to 4,950 million roubles $159 million at the exchange rate as of the date of the transaction payable in instalments to 15 July 2014.
The consideration was measured as the present value of the expected cash outflows.
In 2014 and 2015, the parties amended the payment schedule.
The latest schedule effective at 31 December 2016 provides for an execution of payments of 500 million roubles in each of January 2017 and 2018 and 480 million roubles in 2019.
From the dates of the amendments the Group incurs interest charges on the unpaid liability.
In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Group paid 500 million roubles $7 million, $Nil and 990 million roubles $28 million, respectively, of purchase consideration.
Previously, in 2013, 1,980 million roubles $61 million were paid.
At 31 December 2016, 2015 and 2014, trade and other accounts payable included liabilities relating to this acquisition in the amount of $27 million, $28 million and $36 million, respectively.

Due to the postponement of the major project activities, the Group assessed the recoverability of its investment in Timir at 30 September 2016 and 31 December 2015 and 2014.
The recoverable amount of the asset was based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections based on the business plans approved by management and an appropriate discount rate reflecting time value of money and risks associated with the asset.
The period of the forecast was 23 years.
As a result, in 2016 and 2015, the Group partially impaired its investment in Timir.
The major drivers that led to impairment were the decrease in the expected long-term prices for iron ore, the increase in the amount of the required capital expenditures to maintain the production at the budgeted capacities and the postponement of the start of production for 2 years.
In the value-in-use calculation management assumed that the railway tariffs for the iron ore transportation in the Yakutia region, which are established by the local railway companies, will be reduced to the general level of the tariffs in Russia.
These tariffs have not been agreed yet by the parties.
If the assumption were not valid, this would lead to an additional impairment of $55 million which would give a $19 million effect on the share of profits losses of joint ventures and associates recognised in the consolidated statement of operations.

com 209 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22.
Loans and Borrowings continued Compliance with Financial Covenants Some of the loan agreements and terms and conditions of notes provide for certain covenants in respect of EVRAZ plc and its subsidiaries.
The covenants impose restrictions in respect of certain transactions and financial ratios, including restrictions in respect of indebtedness and profitability.
EBITDA used for covenants compliance calculations is determined based on the definitions of the respective loan agreements and may differ from that used by management for evaluation of performance.
Several bank credit facilities totalling $1,829 million contain certain financial maintenance covenants.
These covenants require EVRAZ plc to maintain two key ratios, consolidated net indebtedness to 12month consolidated EBITDA and 12-month consolidated EBITDA to adjusted 12-month consolidated interest expense, within certain limits.
Also the covenants contain a limitation on the amount of EVRAZ plc total consolidated indebtedness.
A breach of one or both of these ratios or excess of the indebtedness limit would constitute an event of default under the facility which in turn may trigger cross default events under other debt instruments of the Group.
The terms of certain facilities also set certain limitations on dividend payments by EVRAZ plc, acquisitions and disposals.
In the first half of 2016, EVRAZ plc signed amendments to these facilities, whereby the testing of financial ratios was suspended for three semi-annual testing periods starting from 30 June 2016, subject to compliance with certain additional restrictions on indebtedness and dividends.
As a result, as of 31 December 2016, only one of the outstanding facilities has the EBITDA to interest cover ratio tested against a comfortable level of minimum 1.5x.
Transaction costs relating to these amendments amounted to $4 million.
Notes due 2018, 2020, 2021 and 2022 totalling $2,903 million issued by Evraz Group S. A. a holding company directly wholly owned by EVRAZ plc, have covenants restricting the incurrence of indebtedness by the issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries conditional on a gross leverage ratio.
While the ratio level itself does not constitute a breach of covenants, exceeding the threshold triggers a restriction on incurrence of consolidated indebtedness, which is removed once the ratio goes back below the threshold.
The effect of the restriction is such that Evraz Group S. A. and its subsidiaries are not allowed to increase the consolidated indebtedness at the level of Evraz Group S. A. but are allowed to refinance existing indebtedness subject to certain conditions.
The incurrence covenants are in line with the Groups financial strategy and, therefore, do not constitute any excessive restriction on its operations.
The $400 million 7.75% notes due 2017 issued by Raspadskaya in 2012, out of which $374 million are held by Evraz Group S. A. at 31 December 2016, have covenants similar to those of Evraz Group S. A. but with the ratio calculation based on the consolidated numbers of Raspadskaya and the restrictions applying only to Raspadskaya and its subsidiaries.
These restrictions have the same effect on Raspadskaya, but no effect on EVRAZ plc and its other subsidiaries that are not part of the Raspadskaya Group.
The $350 million notes due 2019 issued by Evraz Inc NA Canada in November 2014 have certain covenants, that contain restrictions on the incurrence of new debt by EVRAZ North America plc, the parent company of Evraz Inc NA and Evraz Inc NA Canada, and its subsidiaries together, Evraz North America and restrictions on certain types of payments, including dividends, from Evraz North America.
During 2016 the Group was in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants.

Employee Benefits Russian Plans Certain Russian subsidiaries of the Group provide regular lifetime pension payments and lump-sum amounts payable at retirement date.
These benefits generally depend on years of service, level of remuneration and amount of pension payment under the collective bargaining agreements.
Other post-employment benefits consist of various compensations and certain non-cash benefits.
The Group funds the benefits when the amounts of benefits fall due for payment.
In addition, some subsidiaries have defined benefit plans under which contributions are made to a separately administered non-state pension fund.
The Group matches 100% of the employees contributions to the fund up to 4% of their monthly salary.
The Groups contributions become payable at the participants retirement dates.
At the end of the reporting year the benefit obligation was valued based on the terms of the pension plan assuming that all defined benefit plan participants will continue to participate in the plan.
Defined contribution plans represent payments made by the Group to the Russian state pension, social insurance and medical insurance funds at the statutory rates in force, based on gross salary payments.
Ukrainian Plans The Ukrainian subsidiaries make regular contributions to the State Pension Fund thereby compensating 100% of preferential pensions paid by the fund to employees who worked under harmful and hard conditions.
The amount of such pension depends on years of service and salary.
In addition, employees receive lump-sum payments on retirement and other benefits under collective labour agreements.
These benefits are based on years of service and level of compensation.
All these payments are considered as defined benefit plans.
The Ukrainian pension legislation provides for annual indexation of pensions, at least up to the level of CPI.
The indexation of pensions in a particular year depends on the availability of financial resources in the State pension fund.
The subsidiaries are obliged to pay preferential pensions indexed according to the governments decision.
The Group determined the amount of defined benefit obligations based on the assumption that pensions will be indexed despite possible insufficiency of money in the State pension fund, which would result in a non-fulfilment of this law by the fund itself and, consequently, would cancel the obligations of Ukrainian enterprises to pay higher pensions.

Employee Benefits continued US and Canadian Plans The Groups subsidiaries in the USA and Canada have defined benefit pension plans that cover specified eligible employees.
Benefits are based on pensionable years of service, pensionable compensation, or a combination of both depending on the individual plan.
The subsidiaries also have U. S. and Canadian supplemental retirement plans SERPs, which are non-qualified plans designed to maintain benefits for eligible employees at the plan formula level.
The subsidiaries provide other unfunded post-retirement medical and life insurance plans OPEBs for certain of their eligible employees upon retirement after completion of a specified number of years of service.
For the pension plans, SERPs and OPEBs, the subsidiaries use a measurement date for plan assets and obligations of 31 December.
Certain employees that were hired after specified dates are no longer eligible to participate in the defined benefit pension plans.
Those employees are instead enrolled in defined contribution plans and receive a contribution funded by the Groups subsidiaries equal to 37% of annual wages, including applicable bonuses.
The defined contribution plans are funded annually and, depending on their work location, participants benefits vesting dates range from immediate to after three years of service.
In addition, the subsidiaries have defined contribution plans available for eligible U. S. and Canadian-based employees in which the subsidiaries generally match a percentage of the participants contributions.
In the third quarter of 2015, a U. S. subsidiary made lump-sum settlement offers to former employees vested in one of its three U. S. -based pension plans.
Eligible participants were provided with a one-time opportunity to choose either a lump-sum settlement immediately, or to begin receiving their annuity payments in December 2015, irrespective of the former employees age or retirement status.
Approximately 749 employees, or 61% of those eligible, elected to take the lump-sum settlement, triggering settlement accounting for two of the U. S. subsidiarys plans.
Other Plans Defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans are maintained by the subsidiaries located in the Republic of South Africa and Italy.
Defined Contribution Plans The Groups expenses under defined contribution plans were as follows: US$ million 2016 2015 2014 Expense under defined contribution plans $ 212 $ 254 $ 398 Defined Benefit Plans The Russian, Ukrainian and other defined benefit plans are mostly unfunded and the US and Canadian plans are partially funded.
Except as disclosed above, in 2016 there were no significant plan amendments, curtailments or settlements.
The Groups defined benefit plans are exposed to the risks of unexpected growth in benefit payments as a result of increases in life expectancy, inflation, and salaries.
As the plan assets include significant investments in quoted and unquoted equity shares, corporate and government bonds and notes, the Group is also exposed to equity market risk.

The exchange is exercised on approximately the same dates as the payments under the bonds.
The swap contracts, which were effective at 31 December 2014-2016, are summarised in the table below.

The Group accounted for these derivatives at fair value which was determined using valuation techniques.
The fair value was calculated as the present value of the expected cashflows under the contracts at the reporting dates.
Future rouble-denominated cashflows were translated into US dollars using the USD RUB implied yield forward curve.
The discount rates used in the valuation were the non-deliverable forward rate curve and the interest rate swap curve for US dollar at the reporting dates.
In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the change in fair value of the derivatives of $273 million, $439 million and $ 494 million, respectively, together with a realised gain loss on the swap transactions, amounting to $ 250 million, $ 464 million and $ 94 million, respectively, was recognised within gain loss on financial assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of operations Note 7.
In 20142016, upon repayment of the 8.40%, 9.95%, 8.75% and 13.5% bonds, the related swap contracts matured.
Hedging Instruments In July 2015, the Group completed a placement of bonds in the total amount of 15,000 million Russian roubles $247 million at 31 December 2016, which bear interest of 12.95% per annum and have the next put date on 26 June 2019.
The Group used an intercompany loan to transfer the proceeds from the bonds within the Group.
To manage the currency exposure, the Group entered into a series of cross currency swap contracts with several banks under which it agreed to deliver US-dollar denominated interest payments at rates ranging from 5.90% to 6.55% per annum plus the notional amount, totaling approximately $265 million, in exchange for rouble-denominated interest payments at the rate of 12.95% per annum plus notional, totaling 14,948 million roubles $246 million at 31 December 2016.

In 2016 and 2015, the change in fair value of these derivatives amounted to $37 million and $ 59 million, respectively.
The realised gain on the swap transactions amounting to $14 million 2015: $5 million was related to the interest portion of the change in fair value of the swap.
Under IFRS the lesser of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument from inception of the hedge and the cumulative change in present value of the expected future cash flows on the hedged item from inception of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and the remaining loss on the hedging instrument is recorded through the statement of operations.
In 2016 and 2015, the Group did not recognise any amounts in other comprehensive income.
All the swaps were assessed as effective.
In 2016 and 2015, $37 and $ 59 million, respectively, were recorded in the Foreign exchange gains losses caption in the consolidated statement of operations.
Contingent Consideration Payable Contingent consideration represents additional payments for the acquisition of Stratcor in 2006.
This consideration could be paid each year up to 2019.
The payments depend on the deviation of the average prices for vanadium pentoxide from certain levels and the amounts payable for each year are limited to maximum amounts.
In 20142016, the Group was not required to pay this consideration due to the movements in the vanadium pentoxide market relative to the levels set in the agreement.

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and trade accounts receivable.
To manage credit risk related to cash, the Group maintains its available cash, mainly in US dollars, in reputable international banks and major Russian banks.
Management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of the banks in which it deposits cash.
The Groups trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities.
In 2016, the major customers were Russian Railways and Enbridge Inc. 4% and 3.5% of total sales, respectively.
Part of the Groups sales is made on terms of letter of credit.
In addition, the Group requires prepayments from certain customers.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables, except when a customer applies for credit terms which are longer than normal.
In this case, the Group requires bank guarantees or other collateral.
The Group has developed standard credit terms and constantly monitors the status of accounts receivable collection and the creditworthiness of the customers.
Certain of the Groups long-standing Russian customers for auxiliary products, such as heat and electricity, represent municipal enterprises and governmental organisations that experience financial difficulties.
The significant part of doubtful debts allowance consists of receivables from such customers.
The Group has no practical ability to terminate the supply to these customers and negotiates with regional and municipal authorities the terms of recovery of these receivables.

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies continued Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group prepares a rolling 12-month financial plan which ensures that the Group has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses, financial obligations and investing activities as they arise.
The Group exercises a daily monitoring of cash proceeds and payments.
The Group maintains credit lines and overdraft facilities that can be drawn down to meet short-term financing needs.
If necessary, the Group refinances its short-term debt by long-term borrowings.
The Group also uses forecasts to monitor potential and actual financial covenants compliance issues Note 22.
Where compliance is at risk, the Group considers options including debt repayment, refinancing or covenant reset.
The Group has developed standard payment periods in respect of trade accounts payable and monitors the timeliness of payments to its suppliers and contractors.
The following tables summarise the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments, including interest payments.

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies continued Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures, while optimising the return on risk.
Interest Rate Risk The Group borrows on both a fixed and variable rate basis and has other interest-bearing liabilities, such as finance lease liabilities and other obligations.
The Group incurs interest rate risk on liabilities with variable interest rates.
The Groups treasury function performs analysis of current interest rates.
In case of changes in market fixed or variable interest rates management may consider the refinancing of a particular debt on more favourable terms.
The Group does not have any financial assets with variable interest rates.
Fair Value Sensitivity Analysis for Fixed Rate Instruments The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the Groups profits.
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets as assets available for sale.
Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the Groups equity.
Cash Flow Sensitivity Analysis for Variable Rate Instruments Based on the analysis of exposure during the years presented, reasonably possible changes in floating interest rates at the reporting date would affect profit before tax PBT by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
In estimating reasonably possible changes the Group assessed the volatility of interest rates during the reporting periods.

The currencies in which these transactions are denominated are primarily US dollars, Canadian dollars and euro.
The Group does not have formal arrangements to mitigate currency risks of the Groups operations.
However, management believes that the Group is partly secured from currency risks as foreign currency denominated sales are used to cover repayment of foreign currency denominated borrowings.

In estimating reasonably possible changes the Group assessed the volatility of foreign exchange rates during the reporting periods.
Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies continued Market Risk continued Currency Risk continued Sensitivity Analysis continued In addition to the effects of changes in the exchange rates disclosed above, the Group is exposed to currency risk on derivatives Note 25.
The impact of currency risk on the fair value of these derivatives is disclosed below.

The carrying amounts of financial instruments, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, short-term accounts receivable and payable, short-term loans receivable and payable and promissory notes, approximate their fair value.
At 31 December the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value: 2016 2015 2014 US$ million Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets measured at fair value Available-for-sale financial assets Note 13 3 5 17 Liabilities measured at fair value Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments Note 25 274 713 Hedging instruments Note 25 22 59 Contingent consideration payable for the acquisition of Stratcor Note 25 2 www.

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies continued Fair Value of Financial Instruments continued During the reporting period, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements.
The following table shows financial instruments for which carrying amounts differ from fair values at 31 December.
The fair value of long-term bank loans was calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the Groups market rates of interest at the reporting dates Level 3.
The discount rates used for valuation of financial instruments were as follows: Currency in which financial instruments are denominated 2016 2015 2014 USD 3.7 6.4% 4.1 9.8% 8.9 14.7% EUR 1.8 4.0% 1.8 6.2% 1.9% RUB 11.03% 12.77% 230 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report & Accounts 2016 28.
Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies continued Capital Management Capital includes equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent entity.
Revaluation surplus which is included in capital is not subject to capital management because of its nature.
The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise the return to shareholders.
The Board of Directors reviews the Groups performance and establishes key performance indicators.
There were no changes in the objectives, policies and processes during 2016.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it by the issue of new shares, dividend payments to shareholders, and the purchase of treasury shares.
In addition, the Group monitors distributable profits on a regular basis and determines the amounts and timing of dividend payments taking into account cashflow and other constraints.
Non-cash Transactions Transactions that did not require the use of cash or cash equivalents, not disclosed in the notes above, were as follows in the years ended 31 December: US$ million 2016 2015 2014 Liabilities for purchases of property, plant and equipment $ 71 $ 63 $ 45 Loans provided in the form of payments by banks for property, plant and equipment 46 30.
Commitments and Contingencies Operating Environment of the Group The Group is one of the largest vertically integrated steel producers globally and the largest steel producer in Russia.
The Groups major subsidiaries are located in Russia, Ukraine, the USA and Canada.
Russia and Ukraine are considered to be developing markets with higher economic and political risks.
Steel consumption is affected by the cyclical nature of demand for steel products and the sensitivity of that demand to worldwide general economic conditions.
The global economic recession resulted in a significantly lower demand for steel products and decreased profitability.
In addition, the political crisis over Ukraine led to an additional uncertainty in the global economy.
The unrest in the Southeastern region of Ukraine and the economic sanctions imposed on Russia caused the depreciation of national currencies, economic slowdown, deterioration of liquidity in the banking sector, and tighter credit conditions within Russia and Ukraine.
In addition, a significant drop in crude oil prices negatively impacted the Russian economy.
The combination of the above resulted in reduced access to capital, a higher cost of capital, increased inflation and uncertainty regarding economic growth.
If the Ukrainian crisis broadens and further sanctions are imposed on Russia, this could have an adverse impact on the Groups business.
Management believes it is taking appropriate measures to support the sustainability of the Groups business in the current circumstances.
The global economic climate continues to be unstable and this may negatively affect the Groups results and financial position in a manner not currently determinable.
com 231 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 30.
Commitments and Contingencies continued Taxation Russian and Ukrainian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently.
Further, the interpretation of tax legislation by tax authorities as applied to the transactions and activity of the Groups entities may not coincide with that of management.
As a result, tax authorities may challenge transactions and the Groups entities may be assessed for additional taxes, penalties and interest.
In Russia and Ukraine the periods remain open to review by the tax and customs authorities with respect to tax liabilities for three calendar years preceding the year of review.
Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods.
Management believes that it has paid or accrued all taxes that are applicable.
Where uncertainty exists, the Group has accrued tax liabilities based on its best estimate of the probable outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, which will be required to settle these liabilities.
Possible liabilities which were identified by management at the end of the reporting period as those that can be subject to different interpretations of the tax laws and other regulations and are not accrued in these financial statements could be up to approximately $23 million.
Contractual Commitments At 31 December 2016, the Group had contractual commitments for the purchase of production equipment and construction works for an approximate amount of $172 million.
In 2010, the Group concluded a contract with PraxAir Note 2, Accounting Judgements for the construction of an air separation plant and for the supply of oxygen and other gases produced by a third party at this plant for a period of 20 years extended to 25 years in 2015.
Due to a change in plans of the third party provider and in managements assessment of the extent of sales of gases to third parties, effective from 2015 the Group no longer considers this supply contract to fall within the scope of IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease.
At 31 December 2016, the Group has committed expenditure of $552 million over the life of the contract.
Social Commitments The Group is involved in a number of social programmes aimed to support education, healthcare and social infrastructure development in towns where the Groups assets are located.
The Group budgeted to spend approximately $63 million under these programmes in 2017.
Environmental Protection In the course of the Groups operations, the Group may be subject to environmental claims and legal proceedings.
The quantification of environmental exposures requires an assessment of many factors, including changing laws and regulations, improvements in environmental technologies, the quality of information available related to specific sites, the assessment stage of each site investigation, preliminary findings and the length of time involved in remediation or settlement.
The Group has a number of environmental claims and proceedings which are at an early stage of investigation.
Environmental provisions in relation to these proceedings that were recognised at 31 December 2016 amounted to $12 million.
Preliminary estimates available of the incremental costs indicate that such costs could be up to $263 million.
The Group has insurance agreements, which are expected to provide reimbursement of the costs to be actually incurred.
Management believes that, as of now, an economic outflow of the additional costs is not probable and any pending environmental claims or proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of operations.
In addition, the Group has committed to various environmental protection programmes covering periods from 2017 to 2022, under which the Group will perform works aimed at reductions in environmental pollution and contamination.
As of 31 December 2016, the costs of implementing these programmes are estimated at $119 million.
232 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report & Accounts 2016 30.
Commitments and Contingencies continued Legal Proceedings The Group has been and continues to be the subject of legal proceedings, none of which has had, individually or in aggregate, a significant effect on the Groups operations or financial position.
The Group exercises judgement in measuring and recognising provisions and the exposure to contingent liabilities related to pending litigations or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities.
Judgement is necessary in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the final settlement.
Because of the inherent uncertainties in this evaluation process, actual losses may be different from the originally estimated provision.
These estimates are subject to change as new information becomes available, primarily with the support of internal specialists or with the support of outside consultants.
As of 31 December 2016, possible legal risks approximate $21 million.
