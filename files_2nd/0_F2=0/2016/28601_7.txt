Randgold ResouRces ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEmENTS 2016 F-4 Relative iMPaCt ON FiNaNCial StateMeNtS ThE AUDIT RISK 1. assessment of tax claims in Mali and appropriateness of provisioning and disclosure The group is currently subject to tax claims totalling $122.7 million associated with its malian operations.
The group has been subject to a number of different tax claims in mali over a number of years which have been disputed.
During 2013, the group commenced international arbitration proceedings against the State of mali, disputing the validity of a number of claims.
During the year, the arbitration tribunal issued its final and binding award, resulting in the Loulo mine being awarded and paid $29.2 million in principal together with an award for costs and interest from the State of mali for monies found by the tribunal to have been wrongfully taken by the government which related to a TVA value added tax repayment.
In addition, the arbitration ruled that TVA withholding tax on foreign suppliers was due to the State of mali, although amounts due were also confirmed to be recoverable as TVA receivables such that it is considered to be neutral tax by the group.
The arbitration proceedings were only in relation to certain claims and the remaining disputed claims total $122.7 million as at the year end.
Furthermore, during the year, the group made payments totalling $27.3 million relating to elements of certain claims that were not subject to the arbitration process, and also paid $25.0 million of taxes in advance in response to the State of malis demands.
Given the size and nature of the claims and ongoing disputes, the recognition and presentation of any liabilities or contingent liabilities arising as a result of the taxation claims represented key judgements and a key risk for our audit.
While the arbitration ruling provided conclusion over certain claims, the relative audit risk level is considered to have increased in 2016, given the wider challenges experienced with the malian tax authority in Q4 2016 in relation to the office closures and payment demands.
how we addressed the audit risk: We tested managements controls over the review of tax claims by the board and its committees, including its review of appropriate professional advice obtained.
We critically reviewed the groups mining conventions, arbitration ruling, external professional advice from managements experts and correspondence with the State of mali to consider the extent to which the directors assessment that any contingent liabilities associated with the material tax claims are remote remains appropriate.
We confirmed the completeness and accuracy of the claim values by agreeing to tax correspondence.
We have discussed and critically assessed managements own assessment of the status of each significant element of the claims with the groups malian tax advisors.
We agreed the $27.3 million payment to bank statements in the year in respect of elements of outstanding claims and considered whether additional provisions were required in respect of subsequent periods not covered by the settlement.
We further considered the extent to which the amounts settled were historically accrued or provided to determine whether the settlements indicated weaknesses in managements previous assessment of the tax claims.
We agreed the $25.0 million payment to bank statements and reviewed the correspondence supporting the $25.0 million payment of taxes in advance recorded as a receivable to confirm that the payment was not a settlement in nature.
We considered the recoverability of the amounts based on the merits of the groups assessment of the outstanding tax claims, together with the ability to enforce recovery of the advanced taxes considering factors such as the outcome of the recent arbitration ruling.
We have obtained confirmations from local and international legal and tax advisors which supported the directors assessment that the material claims were without legal merit and assessed as remote under IFRS.
In relying upon the assessments made by such experts, we evaluated the competence and objectivity of professional advisors relied upon by management.
We found the groups estimates and judgements in respect of its assessment of the provisioning for outstanding tax claims to be balanced and suitably supported by analysis of the claims and independent advice from managements external experts.
We found the disclosures included in the financial statements to be proportionate and relevant notwithstanding the fact that the material claims are considered remote.
Randgold ResouRces ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEmENTS 2016 F-5 FINANCIAL STATEmENTS THE AUDIT RISK CONTINUED 2.
Recoverability of tva receivables in Mali and the Democratic Republic of Congo DRC The group is carrying TVA receivables totalling $94.4 million, substantially in respect of its Loulo and Gounkoto operations in mali.
In addition, the equity accounted Kibali joint venture based in the DRC holds a further $131.1 million of TVA receivables and duties on fuel of which, given the groups 45% joint venture interest, $59.0 million is attributable to the group.
mali The group has experienced significant delays obtaining cash refunds for the amounts due from the State of mali.
however, Loulos TVA receivables have reduced in 2016 mainly as a result of a $28.4 million receipt from the State of mali in line with the arbitration award see above for further details.
The group continues to offset TVA receivables against corporate taxes and royalties payable, which is permitted under the terms of its mining Convention.
$31.3 million has been offset during the year.
At Loulo, the TVA receivable includes $16.6 million in respect of TVA withholding tax on payments to foreign service providers which were found payable by the group under the arbitration ruling see page F-5.
The arbitration ruled that these amounts are tax neutral and are therefore also recoverable as TVA.
Whilst the group submitted these amounts for recovery under the TVA system, the submissions have been rejected by the tax authority, which appears in contravention of the arbitration ruling.
DRC During the year, there was a temporary suspension of TVA repayments by the DRC tax authority.
While a number of cash refunds have subsequently been received during the year from the tax authority, in respect of TVA receivable at the Kibali joint venture, these have not been received on a timely basis and recovery remains slow.
Overall The fiscal pressures on the malian and DRC governments and the evolving nature of the respective tax regimes is such that there is an inherent risk of disputes affecting the underlying recoverability of TVA balances.
In addition, where balances are not subject to dispute, judgement exists as to the timing of recovery of such amounts either through tax offsetting mali or cash recovery DRC.
As such, the recoverability, carrying value and presentation of TVA are considered to represent key judgements and a risk for our audit.
The relative risk level was considered to have increased in 2016, particularly given the reduced level of receipts in the DRC and the wider challenges experienced with the malian tax authority in Q4 2016, especially in relation to the tax disputes as noted above.
how we addressed the audit risk: We tested the controls over the accuracy of the TVA returns and over the review of the recoverability of the TVA.
We obtained and considered the groups correspondence with tax authorities in respect of TVA for indicators that such taxes were irrecoverable under local tax rules or subject to dispute.
In addition, we made inquiries of the board and management and reviewed minutes of meetings to identify indicators TVA is disputed or irrecoverable.
We agreed that the TVA claimed during the year had been approved by the relevant tax authority or was not subject to a formal dispute.
We agreed the cash receipts and amounts offset to tax submissions in mali during the year.
In the DRC, we agreed the receipt of funds against TVA receivables and assessed the allocation of such receipts against TVA due.
We considered and challenged managements assessment of the carrying value, timing of recovery including associated discounting provisions and presentation of the receivables, together with the appropriateness of the assumptions made in reaching those conclusions.
In particular, this included consideration of the payment history, apparent fiscal constraints on the respective governments, arrangements for future settlement, the nature of ongoing correspondence, ongoing taxation disputes, terms of the mining conventions in mali that confer rights to offset such taxes claimed against other taxes due, and challenging the appropriateness of assumptions and estimates made regarding the value and timing of eligible future taxes available for offset under the terms of such conventions.
In respect of the $16.6 million Loulo TVA submission rejected by the tax authorities, we critically assessed the recoverability of the balance considering factors such as the arbitration ruling, relations with the State of mali and advice from the groups international tax and legal advisors.
In mali, we found managements estimate that existing TVA receivables will be recovered through tax offsets to be supported by forecasts that are consistent with the groups budgets and based on balanced assumptions.
Whilst $16.6 million is currently subject to dispute at Loulo we found the boards assessment that such amounts will ultimately be accepted by the tax authority to be justified.
In the DRC, we found no evidence of disputes in respect of TVA receivables claimed.
however, in the absence of a right to offset TVA receivables with other taxes and the continued delays in cash receipts, we found there to be a level of judgement required regarding the timing of recovery.

Randgold ResouRces ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEmENTS 2016 F-6 3. impairment of mining assets and life of mine estimates The groups mining assets, including property, plant and equipment, ore stockpiles and share of assets in joint ventures represent its most significant assets and total $2.9bn at 31 December 2016.
While the groups impairment tests have historically demonstrated headroom and the gold price environment and outlook has improved since 31 December 2015, the assessment of the groups Life of mine Lom plans and any related impairment to the carrying value of mining assets and investments in joint ventures requires significant estimation by management relating to key assumptions included in the impairment models.
The key assumptions include future gold prices, oil prices, ore reserves and future production volumes, future production costs and appropriate discount and inflation rates.
The relative risk level is considered to have decreased in 2016 given the improved gold price.
how we addressed the audit risk: We tested the controls over the review of the impairment and Lom models, budgeting process and determination of key estimates.
We evaluated managements impairment models for the mines against Lom plans and our understanding of the operations, and critically challenged the key estimates and assumptions used by management in each discounted cash flow model.
Our testing included comparison of the gold price forecasts to forward gold price data, market consensus information and trends.
We updated our assessment of discount rates for the assets in conjunction with our valuation specialists and critically reviewed the forecast cost and production profiles against approved mine plans and empirical performance.
The impairment models and sensitivity analysis prepared by management indicated that no impairment charges were required and that each cash generating unit had headroom.
We challenged managements sensitivity assessments and performed our own sensitivity calculations in respect of short and long term gold prices, discount rates, inflation rates and operational performance, along with considering the appropriateness of related disclosures given in note 3.
We found the groups assessment that its impairment models support the carrying value of mining assets, ore stockpiles and investments in joint ventures to be appropriate with the key assumptions well considered and balanced.
Overall, we found that the Lom plans demonstrate headroom and were not unduly sensitive to reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions.
Given the volatile nature of gold prices and the inherent judgement in Lom planning, we found the disclosures in the financial statements in respect of the carrying value of mining assets, ore stockpiles and investments in joint ventures to be appropriate.
4. accounting estimates in underground mining The group has incurred substantial capital expenditure during the year at Loulo and Kibali and the capital expenditure relating to the underground mines included a number of areas requiring significant judgement and estimation that represented a risk for our audit.
The appropriateness of the allocation of costs between operating and capital expenditure at Loulo and Kibali represented a key focus for our audit.
The group applies a unit of production depreciation policy, which involves judgement in determining the appropriate ore reserves attributable to key asset categories within the mines.
In addition, judgement is required regarding the date at which depreciation commences and the application of the unit of production accounting policy: in particular during the continued commissioning of further assets at the Kibali underground mine.
There remains significant ongoing capital development and judgement surrounding the allocation of costs, however the relative risk is considered to have increased in 2016. how we addressed the audit risk: We performed tests of controls and substantive procedures to obtain assurance as to the authorisation, accuracy and completeness of the recording and classification of capital expenditure.
We also undertook verification testing on expenditure to supporting documentation such as invoices and contracts.
We critically assessed managements capitalisation policies and managements allocation of costs between operating expenditure and capital expenditure to assess the allocation of such costs based on the nature of the underlying activity, supported by sample based verification, meetings with the mine planning departments and tests of controls.
In respect of the groups depreciation calculations, we updated our assessment of the groups depreciation policy and its application.
We agreed the inputs to the calculations back to source documentation, critically assessed managements allocation of ore reserves to specific depreciable asset categories and agreed the ore reserves figures used to the reserves statement.
As part of this review, we met with operational management to assess the asset and reserve allocations and assessed the competence and objectivity of the groups Competent Persons.
We undertook a detailed assessment of the asset registers, assessing the commissioning dates and associated start date for depreciation against capital project reports and our understanding of the activities in the year.
We found costs associated with capital projects to be appropriately recorded and classified during our audit.
We found the underground mining cost allocation policies to be sufficiently clearly defined and appropriate for the nature of the underlying development projects and the phased commissioning of the underground mines.
We found the unit of production depreciation policies and their application at mine level to be appropriate and, whilst judgemental, appropriately depreciates the assets over the ore reserves to which the assets relate.

The provisions for rehabilitation costs include estimates for the effect of inflation and changes in estimates and have been discounted to their present value at 2.5% 2015: 2.25 % per annum, being an estimate equivalent to the risk free rate determined with reference to US government bonds with maturity dates comparable to the estimated rehabilitation of the mines.
Rehabilitation cash flows are risk adjusted.
Limited environmental rehabilitation regulations currently exist in mali and Cte dIvoire to govern the mines, so the directors have based the provisions for environmental rehabilitation on standards set by the World Bank, which require an environmental management plan, an annual environmental report, a closure plan, an up-to-date register of plans of the facility, preservation of public safety on closure, carrying out rehabilitation works and ensuring sufficient funds exist for the closure works.
however, it is reasonably possible that the groups estimate of its ultimate rehabilitation liabilities could change as a result of changes in regulations or cost estimates.
The group is committed to rehabilitation of its mines.
It makes use of independent environmental consultants for advice and it also uses past experience in similar situations to ensure that the provisions for rehabilitation are adequate.
Current Lom plans envisage the expected outflow to occur at the end of the Lom which is 2029 for Loulo, 2021 for Tongon and 2027 for Gounkoto.

Restricted shares issued to employees Restricted shares issued to employees are subject to a satisfactory performance level being achieved during the 12 month period prior to the exercise date of each tranche of shares.
The minimum performance level to be achieved is defined as level 3 on the companys performance management system.
All employees to whom restricted shares have been granted are expected to meet this level of performance.
The performance period is typically up to five years where the employee must remain in employment for the shares to vest.
There are no market based vesting conditions on the share awards.
The fair value of the restricted shares issued in 2016 and 2015 are detailed below and the share-based payment charge is charged to profit evenly between the grant and vesting dates.
The restriction on the shares no dividends received during the vesting period had a minimal impact on the fair value estimate at the grant date.
The restricted shares have an exercise price of nil.
The fair value of the restricted shares issued in 2016 was calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The key assumptions used in this model for shares granted during the year ending 31 December 2016 were as follows: GROUP $000 NOTE January 2016 August 2016 Quantity of shares issued 246 800 127 300 Fair value of shares issued $17.9 million $14.6 million Performance period 3, 4 and 5 years 3, 4 and 5 years Volatility 15.1 34.8%, 34.6% and 34.3% 34.8%, 36.4% and 37.2% Risk-free interest rate 0.9%, 1.3% and 1.3% 0.8%, 1.0% and 1.0% Dividend yield 0.84% 0.56% Weighted average share price on grant and valuation date 15.2 $75.2$117.6 15.1 Volatility is based on the three year historical volatility of the companys shares on each grant date.
15.2 Weighted average share price for the valuation is calculated taking into account the market price on all grant dates.
The market price at the award dates was $83.8 and $60.4 respectively and vested over three, four and five years in equal tranches.
The volatility, risk free rate and dividend yield had no significant impact on fair value but were consistent with those above.
The total fair value of the awards was $21.1 million over the vesting periods.
Restricted shares issued to executive directors in 2009 and 2010 The restricted shares issued to executive directors in 2009 and 2010 were subject to directors remaining employed, as well as being subject to a market performance condition, being the companys relative TSR performance over three years against the hSBC Global Gold Index since renamed the Euromoney Global Gold Index.
This was assessed and had a minimal impact on the fair value estimate at the grant date.
The fair value of the restricted shares was based on the share price on the grant date and the share-based payment charge is charged to profit evenly between the grant and vesting dates.
Details of the awards that vested and lapsed in the year are shown on page 236 to 237 of this annual report, together with details of the award dates and market prices at award and vesting dates.
Restricted share awards granted to executive directors in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 The restricted share scheme for 2011, 2012 and 2013 operates with conditional share awards, where the awards will vest in three equal one-third tranches subject to the fulfilment of performance conditions measured on an annual basis.
Shares awarded in 2016, 2015 and 2014 are subject to one four-year performance period of assessment.
If the performance conditions are met, awards vest at the end of each performance period.
The 2011, 2012 and 2013 awards are subject to four performance conditions: absolute TSR market based, EPS growth, additional reserves and absolute reserves.
The 2014 awards are subject to three performance conditions: absolute TSR market based, EPS growth and additional reserves.
The 2016 and 2015 awards are subject to three performance conditions: absolute TSR market based, total cash cost per ounce and additional reserves.
Grant date fair value was calculated using the market-based measure.
No dividends are attributable during the vesting period.
Refer to the remuneration committee report on pages 210 to 237 of this annual report for more detail.
The fair value of the restricted shares issued to executive directors in 2016 and 2015 was calculated using a monte Carlo simulation model.

The fair value was determined at $4.0 million.
The final tranche of the award remains outstanding and subject to the satisfaction of the final performance target, provided the CEO holds office or employment as of the date of achievement of the condition.
Four out of five of the performance conditions have been met.
The performance condition in respect of one fifth 10 006 shares was met at a value of $71.54 per share in 2013 and the performance conditions in respect of three fifths 30 018 shares, comprising three tranches each of 10 006 shares, were met at a value of $67.41 per share in 2014.
As a result, in aggregate 40 024 shares were transferred to the CEO on 29 April 2016.
The shares are restricted from dealing and will only be released when the CEO leaves the service of the company.
In the interim the CEO will be entitled to vote over the shares and receive any dividend accrued on those shares at the time the shares are released.

The operating segments included in internal reports are determined on the basis of their significance to the group.
In particular, operating mines are reported as separate segments and exploration projects that have significant capitalised expenditure or other fixed assets are also reported separately.
The Kibali and morila joint ventures are included on a line by line basis, reflecting internal reporting.
Other parts of the group, including the RAL 1 Limited and RAL 2 Limited joint ventures, are included within corporate and exploration.
The groups chief operating decision maker is considered by management to be the board of directors.
An analysis of the groups business segments, excluding intergroup transactions, is set out below.
major end customers are not identifiable because all gold is sold to an agent.
Financial risk management In the normal course of its operations, the group is exposed to gold price, currency, interest rate, liquidity and credit risks.
In order to manage these risks, the group may enter into transactions which make use of on-balance sheet derivatives.
The group does not acquire, hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
The group has developed a risk management process to facilitate, control and monitor these risks.
The board has approved and monitors this risk management process, inclusive of documented treasury policies, counterpart limits, controlling and reporting structures.
controlling risk in the group The treasury committee is responsible for treasury financial risk management activities within the group.
The treasury committee reviews and recommends to the board all treasury counterparties, limits, instruments and any hedge strategies.
At least two members of the treasury committee need to be present for a decision to be made, one of whom needs to be an executive director.
Unless specific dispensation is obtained from the audit committee, the treasury committee is permitted to invest up to $50.0 million or 20% of the total funds whichever is the higher with each approved institution with two investment ratings of AAor higher noting that no institution can exceed $100.0 million.
The treasury committee is now also permitted to invest up to $25.0 million or 10% of the total funds whichever is the higher with each approved institution with at least one credit rating of AAand another credit rating of above A-, provided that no institution can exceed $50.0m.
The treasury committee continues to be permitted to invest $12.5 million or 5% of the total funds whichever is the higher with each approved institution with an investment rating above Abut below AA-, provided that no investment exceeds $25.0 million.
Approximately one tenth of the cash for the group was held with the groups principal bankers at year end with the remainder held with twelve other financial institutions, in line with the treasury policy.
The treasury committee is responsible for managing investment, gold price, currency, liquidity and credit risk.
The treasury committee monitors adherence to the treasury risk management policy and counterparty limits and provides regular reports to the board.
The financial risk management objectives of the group are defined as follows: Safeguarding the group core earnings stream from its major assets through the effective control and management of gold price risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk: Effective and efficient usage of credit facilities in both the short and long term through the adoption of reliable liquidity management planning and procedures: Ensuring that investment and any hedging transactions are undertaken with creditworthy counterparties: and Ensuring that all contracts and agreements related to risk management activities are coordinated consistently throughout the group and comply where necessary with all relevant regulatory and statutory requirements.
The group continues to hold material TVA receivable balances in mali.
While management continue to pursue recovery of the TVA in cash, it is recognised that in practice given the continued absence of payment, the TVA may only be recovered through the tax offset mechanism set out in the mining convention.
management reports the TVA position and movements on a quarterly basis to the audit committee.
Refer to Key risks and uncertainties on page 202 to 205 of the annual report for details on the groups risk factors.
Foreign currency and commodity price risk In the normal course of business, the group enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies primarily euro, South African rand and Communaut Financire Africaine franc.
As a result, the group is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In general, the group does not enter into any material derivatives to manage these currency risks and no significant positions were held in 2016 and 2015.
Generally, the group does not hedge its exposure to gold price fluctuation risk and gold was sold at market spot prices in 2016 and 2015.
Gold sales are made in US dollars and do not expose the group to any currency fluctuation risk.
however, during periods of capital expenditure or loan finance, the company may use forward contracts or options to reduce the exposure to price movements, while maintaining significant exposure to spot prices.
These derivatives may establish a fixed price for a portion of future production while the group maintains the ability to benefit from increases in the spot gold price for the majority of future gold production.
The group is also exposed to fluctuations in the price of consumables, such as fuel, steel, rubber, cyanide and lime, mainly due to changes in the price of oil, as well as fluctuations in exchange rates.

The TVA balance in Kibali is denominated in CDF and while not a financial instrument under IFRS 7, a movement of 10% in the year end rate would have an effect of $11.9 million on the receivable shown in the Investments in joint ventures in the Statement of financial position.

The sensitivities do not take into account the groups sales and costs and the results of the sensitivities could change due to other factors such as changes in the value of financial assets and liabilities as a result of non-foreign exchange influenced factors.
interest rate and liquidity risk Fluctuations in interest rates impact on the value of short term cash investments and interest payable on financing activities including long term loans, giving rise to interest rate risk.
In the ordinary course of business, the group receives cash from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
The group generally enters into variable interest bearing borrowings.
This cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested in a manner to achieve maximum returns while minimising risks.
The group has in the past been able to actively source financing through public offerings, shareholder loans and third party loans.
The company maintains a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with hSBC and a syndicate of banks which matures in December 2018 and is at present undrawn.
Based on the companys current cash resources and available facilities, projected operating cash flows and capital expenditure, we are confident the company will be able to meet its obligations at the present gold price.
The facility, if drawn, bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.5%, at the lower end of the leverage grid and includes financial covenants in respect of EBIT, EBITDA, net finance charges, tangible net worth, total debt, debt cover and interest cover.

concentration of credit risk The groups cash balances do not give rise to a concentration of credit risk because it deals with a variety of major financial institutions.
Its receivables and loans are regularly monitored and assessed.
Receivables are impaired when it is probable that amounts outstanding are not recoverable as set out in the accounting policy note for receivables.
Gold bullion, the groups principal product, is produced in mali and Cte dIvoire and in the case of its joint ventures in DRC and mali.
The gold produced is sold through the largest accredited gold refinery in the world.
Credit risk is further managed by regularly reviewing the financial statements of the refinery.
The group is further not exposed to significant credit risk on gold sales, as cash is received within a few days of the sale taking place.
While not financial assets under IFRS 7, included in receivables is $89.4 million 2015: $102.9 million refer to note 7 relating to indirect taxes owing to Loulo and Gounkoto by the State of mali, which are denominated in FCFA, which holds some credit risk for the group.
The legally binding mining conventions in mali permit offsetting of other corporate taxes against approved unpaid TVA.
A further $59.0 million 2015: $61.8 million is held within the underlying statement of financial position of the equity accounted Kibali joint venture which is considered recoverable given the history of receipts and receipts obtained during the year and absence of significant disputed items, albeit receipts remain slow and uncertainty exists as to the timing of recovery.
Randgold ResouRces ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEmENTS 2016 F-37 FINANCIAL STATEmENTS FINANCIAl RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED capital risk management The groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, buyback shares, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt net cash divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including borrowings and trade and other payables, as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position, plus net debt net cash.

24. non-gaaP information Randgold has identified certain measures that it believes will assist understanding of the performance of the business.
As the measures are not defined under IFRS they may not be directly comparable with other companies adjusted measures.
The non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, any IFRS measures of performance but management has included them as these are considered to be important comparables and key measures used within the business for assessing performance.
These measures are explained further below: Total cash costs and cash cost per ounce are non-GAAP measures.
Total cash costs and total cash cost per ounce are calculated using guidance issued by the Gold Institute.
The Gold Institute was a non-profit industry association comprising leading gold producers, refiners, bullion suppliers and manufacturers.
This institute has now been incorporated into the National mining Association.
The guidance was first issued in 1996 and revised in November 1999.
Total cash costs, as defined in the Gold Institutes guidance, include mine production, transport and refinery costs, general and administrative costs, movement in production inventories and ore stockpiles, and royalties.
Total cash costs exclude costs associated with capitalised stripping activities.
Total cash costs and cash per ounce also include the companys share of equity accounted joint ventures total cash costs and cash cost per ounce.
Total cash cost per ounce is calculated by dividing total cash costs, as determined using the Gold Institute guidance, by gold ounces sold for the periods presented.
Total cash costs and total cash cost per ounce are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented.
Total cash costs and total cash cost per ounce should not be considered by investors as an alternative to operating profit or net profit attributable to shareholders, as an alternative to other IFRS measures.
The data does not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore amounts presented may not be comparable to data presented by gold producers who do not follow the guidance provided by the Gold Institute.
In particular depreciation and amortisation would be included in a measure of total costs of producing gold under IFRS, but are not included in total cash costs under the guidance provided by the Gold Institute.
Furthermore, while the Gold Institute has provided a definition for the calculation of total cash costs and total cash cost per ounce, the calculation of these numbers may vary from company to company and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
however, Randgold believes that total cash cost per ounce is a useful indicator to investors and management of a mining companys performance as it provides an indication of a companys profitability and efficiency, the trends in cash costs as the companys operations mature, and a benchmark of performance to allow for comparison against other companies.
Cash operating costs and cash operating cost per ounce are calculated by deducting royalties from total cash costs.
Cash operating cost per ounce is calculated by dividing cash operating costs by gold ounces sold for the periods presented.
Total cash operating costs and cash operating cost per ounce include our share of joint ventures total operating cash costs and operating cash cost per ounce.
Gold sales is a non-GAAP measure.
It represents the sales of gold at spot and the gains losses on hedge contracts which have been delivered into at the designated maturity date.
It excludes gains losses on hedge contracts which have been rolled forward to match future sales.
This adjustment is considered appropriate because no cash is received paid in respect of these contracts.
Randgold currently does not have any hedge positions.
Gold sales include our share of our equity accounted joint ventures gold sales.
Randgold ResouRces ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEmENTS 2016 F-40 Profit from mining activity is calculated by subtracting total cash costs from gold sales for all periods presented.
Profit from mining includes our share of our equity accounted joint ventures.
Gold on hand represents gold in dor at the mines multiplied by the prevailing spot gold price at the end of the period.
Gold on hand includes our share of our equity accounted joint ventures gold on hand.
The following table reconciles total cash costs and profit from mining activity as non-GAAP measures, to the information provided in the statement of comprehensive income, determined in accordance with IFRS, for each of the periods set out below: GROUP Year ended year ended $000 31 Dec 2016 31 Dec 2015 Gold sales per IFRS 1 200 777 1 001 420 Gold sales adjustments for joint ventures 345 253 393 469 Gold sales 1 546 030 1 394 889 mine production costs 461 522 498 779 movement in production inventory and ore stockpiles 13 239 17 109 Royalties 78 759 66 680 Royalty adjustment for joint ventures 16 382 15 007 Total royalties 62 377 51 673 Other mining and processing costs 60 141 60 007 Cash cost adjustments for joint ventures 197 153 195 105 Total cash costs 794 432 822 673 Profit from mining activity 751 598 572 216 Share of profits of equity accounted joint ventures, excluding adjustments to sales and cash costs 130 801 121 061 Depreciation and amortisation 175 343 150 902 Exploration and corporate expenditure 41 202 45 067 Finance income 1 553 112 Other income 5 960 15 616 Finance costs 3 193 4 411 Other expenses 5 967 5 725 Profit before income tax 402 605 260 778 Ounces sold oz 1 242 366 1 210 844 Total cash cost per ounce $ oz 639 679 Cash operating cost per ounce $ oz 576 624 25. subsequent events No significant subsequent events requiring disclosure or adjustment have occurred.
