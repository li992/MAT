STRATEGIC REPORT COPPER Hennie Duncan Faul Wanblad COPPER CEO CEO Copper Base Metals In Chile, we have interests in two major copper operations: a 50.1% interest in the Los Bronces mine, which we manage and operate, and a 44% share in the Collahuasi mine: we also manage and operate the El Soldado mine and Chagres smelter 50.1% interest in both.
In Peru, we have an 81.9% interest in the Quellaveco project.

The Operating Model went live at the mine at the end of 2016 and is expected to support capital productivity, improve asset management and mine planning, with a resultant improvement in planning and lower costs.
CASH IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMME As part of the Groups continued focus on cash, 2016 saw the Copper business launch a programme to further improve cash generation in the low price environment, and rebuild a culture of cost awareness in the business.
As a result, cash generation increased by more than $200 million compared with 2015, despite an 11% fall in the average LME copper price, through cost-reduction efforts at the operations and corporate office, including capital expenditure prioritisation and optimising working capital.
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW Underlying EBITDA decreased by 4% to $903 million, driven by a decrease in the average LME copper price and an 18% decline in sales volumes reflecting in part the sale of Anglo American Norte in September 2015, partly offset by a significant reduction in cash costs.
Results benefited from cost-reduction initiatives and productivity improvements across all operations, as well as from the implementation, at the start of 2016, of an optimised mine plan at El Soldado.
At 31 December 2016, 113,204 tonnes of copper were provisionally priced at 251 c lb.
Provisional pricing of copper sales resulted in an underlying EBITDA gain of $144 million 2015: loss of $366 million, bringing the realised copper price to 225 c lb for the period, 1% lower than in 2015.

The redesigned mine plan for El Soldado is yet to receive permitting approval and The Los Bronces operation faced a number of challenges therefore we decided, in February 2017, to temporarily during the year.

In 2016, in contrast, a series of unusual weather events resulted in the operations having to cope with excess water.
