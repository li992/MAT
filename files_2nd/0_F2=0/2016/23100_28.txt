SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES This section provides information on the assets and liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet that are not covered in other sections, including goodwill, other intangible assets and the provision for reinstatement.
5.1 Acquisitions Accounting policy Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are recognised at the point the Group obtains control of the target the acquisition date.
The consideration transferred and the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair value on the acquisition date.
The assets and liabilities acquired are recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet and the profits of the acquired business are recognised in the Consolidated income statement from the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement in the period the acquisition occurs.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Acquisitions in the financial year The transactions in this section occurred in the year ended 31 December 2016 and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
Acquisition of four OCGT development projects On 6 December 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Progress Power Limited PPL, Hirwaun Power Limited HPL, Millbrook Power Limited MPL and Abergelli Power Limited APL.
PPL, HPL, MPL and APL each hold a proposed development option, on land located in England and Wales, for a 299MW Open-Cycle Gas Turbine OCGT project.
Both PPL and HPL have obtained Development Consent Orders for their sites.
The acquisitions represent diversification of our generation capability in response to the changing energy requirements ofthe UK.
Initial consideration of 18.6 million was settled in cash on 3 January 2017, with the amount held as a liability in the balance sheet at 31 December 2016.
The final purchase price depends upon future clearing prices in T-4 capacity market auctions from 20162020.
The range of possible outcomes being zero further consideration if the capacity market clearing price does not exceed 28 KW in these auctions, with a maximum contingent consideration payable of 72 million, based on a clearing price of 75 KW.
The fair value of the contingent consideration at 31 December 2016 was assessed at 3.8 million based on a projection of likely future capacity market clearing prices, discounted to present value at a risk free rateof 2%.
The provisional amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of the four companies, and measured at fair value, are set out in the table below: PPL HPL MPL APL Total m m m m m Financial assets 2.9 3.0 5.9 Property, plant and equipment 0.4 0.6 0.2 0.2 1.4 Financial liabilities 2.9 3.0 5.9 Intangible development asset 8.9 8.7 1.7 1.7 21.0 Total identifiable net assets 9.3 9.3 1.9 1.9 22.4 Goodwill Fair value of consideration payable 9.3 9.3 1.9 1.9 22.4 Comprised of: Initial consideration payable on 3 January 2017 in cash 7.4 7.4 1.9 1.9 18.6 Fair value of contingent consideration 1.9 1.9 3.8 The intangible development assets identified as part of the acquisitions represent the value of planning and consent obtained for each site.
No cash or cash equivalents were acquired in the transaction, therefore the net cash outflow on acquisition was 18.6 million.
The four acquired companies did not trade in the period between the acquisition date and the balance sheet, and no further costs were incurred.
Accordingly, the Consolidated income statement includes no revenue or EBITDA in respect of the acquired companies.
Transaction costs of 0.7 million were recognised as an expense in the period.
Acquisitions after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements were approved The following disclosures relate to acquisitions completed between 1 January and 15 February 2017.
146 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2016 FINANCIALS 5.1 Acquisitions continued Acquisition of Opus Energy Group Limited On 6 December 2016, the Group announced the proposed acquisition of Opus Energy Group Limited Opus Energy for a consideration of 340 million, plus interest calculated on the amount of Opus Energys net assets from 31 March 2016 to the acquisition completion date.
Opus Energy is a well-established energy retail business serving business customers in the SME market.
The transaction represents a diversification of the Groups retail offering, strengthening our presence in the SME market, and provides a range of strategic and financial benefits.
Opus Energy is expected to contribute positively to earnings and cash flow immediately following the acquisition and the combination provides a robust platform for future growth.
The transaction was approved by shareholders on 8 February 2017 and subsequently completed on 10 February 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital on this date.
Total consideration paid in cash, including interest as described above, amounted to 367 million.
No deferred or contingent consideration is payable.
The acquisition was funded by a combination of existing cash reserves and a new 375 million loan facility which was partially drawn on 10 February 2017.
Further details regarding the new facility are disclosed in note 4.3.
Given the short period of time between the transaction completion date and the approval of these financial statements, the initial accounting forthe business combination is not complete.
The table below provides the approximate acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction based as the most recently available management information.
These figures, including the indicative goodwill, are provisional.
Total m Financial assets 169.9 Property, plant and equipment 5.6 Financial liabilities 130.3 Total identifiable net assets 45.2 Goodwill 322.1 Fair value of consideration payable 367.3 The provisional goodwill reflects the economic and strategic benefits described above.
A full review and finalisation of identifiable intangible assets acquired will be completed before the initial accounting for the transaction is completed.
Accordingly, the amount of goodwill recognised in the financial statements may be lower than indicated above.
The provisional financial assets acquired include 170 million of receivables, the majority of which reflect trade receivables for energy supplied tocustomers measured at cost.
By virtue of their short tenor, the contractual amounts receivable and the fair value of these receivables are considered to be the same.
A provision for doubtful debts of 3 million is included within the values above and reflects the best estimate of the contractual cash flows not expected to be recovered.
As the transaction completed after the balance sheet date, there are no amounts included in these financial statements in respect of the transaction other than transaction costs of 1.6 million incurred before 31 December 2016, which have been recognised as an expense in Operating and administrative costs in the income statement.
147 Annual report and accounts 2016 Drax Group plc SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONTINUED 5.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired.
Our goodwill relates to the acquisition of Haven Power in 2009 and Billington Bioenergy in 2015.
Other intangibles include development assets recognised on the acquisition of four OCGT development projects in 2016 and amounts paid in respect of carbon emission allowances for future years.
Accounting policy Goodwill is initially recognised and measured at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Forthe purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU to which it relates and the recoverable amount for that CGU assessed.
Intangibles are recognised at fair value or cost.
The table shows movements and balances: Development Goodwill assets Carbon Total m m m m Cost and carrying amount: At 1 January 2015 10.7 10.7 Additions at cost 3.8 11.8 15.6 At 1 January 2016 14.5 11.8 26.3 Utilised in period 11.8 11.8 Additions at cost 21.0 0.7 21.7 At 31 December 2016 14.5 21.0 0.7 36.2 Goodwill Total goodwill in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 was 14.5 million, with 10.7 million arising on the acquisition of Haven Power in 2009 attributed to the Haven Power CGU and 3.8 million arising on the acquisition of Billington Bioenergy in 2015 attributable to the Billington Bioenergy CGU.
The recoverable amount of both the Haven Power and Billington Bioenergy CGUs is calculated annually, based on a value in use calculation.
The approach for this calculation is the same as that used for the wider asset impairment review conducted by the Group as at 31 December 2016 and is disclosed in note 2.4.
At 31 December 2016, the value in use of goodwill was significantly in excess of its book value in both the Haven Power and Billington Bioenergy CGUs.
Development assets The development assets arose on the acquisition of four OCGT projects in December 2016 see note 5.1 and reflect the value of planning and consents acquired as part of that transaction.
They were measured at fair value on acquisition and will be amortised over the expected period of useful economic life of the projects once they reach commercial operations.
Until operations commence, the assets are considered to have an indefinite life and thus will be subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2016, given the short time since the acquisition of the assets, management consider the fair value of the development assets to be equivalent to the purchase price.
Carbon assets Carbon assets arise on the purchase of CO emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated under the ETS and required for the current 2 financial year, and are measured at cost, net of any impairment.
The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation for the current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and to the extent further purchases are required, the market price at the balance sheet date.
148 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2016 FINANCIALS 5.3 Provisions We make provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning and demolishing our generation assets and remediating the site at the end of the useful economic lives of the assets.
The amount represents the discounted present value of the expected costs.
Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Specifically, provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Groups generating assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis.
The amount provided represents the present value of the expected costs.
Inview of the uncertainty of assessing the amount of any proceeds from the disposal of the assets at the decommissioning date, no reduction inthe provision is made for any such proceeds.
The discount rate used is a risk free pre-tax rate of 1.9% 2015: 2.4%, reflecting the fact that the estimated future cash flows have built in risks specific to the liability.
An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.
The unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable and similar charges.
Reinstatement m Carrying amount: At 1 January 2015 29.8 Unwinding of discount 0.7 At 1 January 2016 30.5 Unwinding of discount 0.8 Adjustment for change in discount rate 3.7 At 31 December 2016 35.0 The provision is estimated using the assumption that the decommissioning and reinstatement will take place at the end of the expected useful life of the power station in 2039, and has been estimated using existing technology at current prices based on independent third party advice, updated on a triennial basis.
The most recent update took place in December 2014.
