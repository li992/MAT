NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 1 General information Introduction Debenhams plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 Company number 5448421.
The address of the registered office is 10 Brock Street, Regents Place, London NW1 3FG.
The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company.
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group or the Debenhams Group are the sale of fashion clothing and accessories, cosmetics and products for use in the home.
The Group has a multi-channel offer, trades from department stores in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Denmark, trades online and has international franchise stores.
The Group prepares its financial statements for the financial year ending on the nearest Saturday to 31 August of a given calendar year.
Consequently the year ended 3 September 2016 is a 53 week year, with the comparative year ended 29 August 2015 being a 52 week year.
The principal subsidiary undertakings within the Group during the financial year ended 3 September 2016 are disclosed in note 4 to the Debenhams plc Company financial statements.
2 Accounting policies The Groups principal accounting policies, as described below, have been consistently applied to all financial years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs including International Accounting Standards IAS and IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under accounting standards as adopted for use in the EU.
The consolidated financial statements for the financial years ended 3 September 2016 and 29 August 2015 have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through the income statement.
The preparation of the financial statements, in conformity with IFRSs, requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these results are based on managements best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates see note 5.
Consolidation The financial statements comprise a consolidation of the accounts of Debenhams plc and all its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries include all entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
On consolidation, inter company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
On acquisition, accounting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries have been changed where these have a significant impact on the Groups income statement or balance sheet to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of staff discounts, and is stated net of value added tax and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is also adjusted for the fair value of loyalty points awarded.
Loyalty points awarded are reflected within liabilities until such time as they are redeemed.
Revenue on department store sales of goods and commission on concession and consignment sales is recognised when goods are sold to the customer.
Retail sales are usually settled in cash or by credit or debit card.
Internet sales are recognised when the goods are despatched to the customer.
Revenue from gift cards and gift vouchers sold by the Group is recognised on the redemption of the gift card or gift voucher.
Revenue from sales to franchisees is recognised 8 86 4 Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial statements when goods are despatched or when goods are sold to the customer depending on the terms of the franchise agreement.
Revenue from franchise fees is recognised when earned.
It is the Groups policy to sell its products to retail customers with a right of return.
Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for such returns at the time of sale.
Supplier income recognition The Group receives income from its suppliers, mainly in the form of settlement discounts, volume-based rebates and marketing and advertising income.
Supplier income is recognised as a deduction from cost of sales, based on the expected entitlement that has been earned up to the balance sheet date.
The Group only recognises supplier income where there is documented evidence of an agreement with a supplier.
Settlement discounts are recognised on receipt of the invoice, provided that the invoice will be settled in accordance with the agreed terms.
Volume-based rebates are earned based on purchase or sales triggers over specific periods, such as the number of units sold to customers or purchased from the supplier.
Volume-based rebates are recognised once the Group has a contractual entitlement to the income, income can be estimated reliably and it is probable that it will be received.
Marketing and advertising income includes markdown or marketing support provided by suppliers and is agreed with suppliers for specified periods and products.
A proportion of the Groups trading terms state that income due from suppliers will be netted against amounts owing to that supplier.
Any outstanding invoiced supplier income relating to these suppliers at the balance sheet date will be deducted from trade payables.
Where these trading terms do not exist, the Group classifies outstanding supplier income within trade receivables.
Where supplier income is earned and not invoiced to the supplier at the balance sheet date, this is classified within prepayments and accrued income.
Segmental reporting IFRS 8 Operating segments requires segment information to be presented based on what is reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Group has identified the Executive Committee as its Chief Operating Decision Maker and has identified two operating segments, UK and International.
Interest recognition Finance income and finance costs are recognised in the period to which they relate using the effective interest rate method.
Dividend distribution A final dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Companys and Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividend is approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Retirement benefit costs The Group operates various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes for its employees.
A defined benefit scheme is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement.
The pension scheme surplus or deficit recognised in the balance sheet represents the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
This surplus or deficit is actuarially calculated on an annual basis using the projected unit credit method.
The income statement is charged or credited with a net interest expense which is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Administration costs of pension funds are recognised as an expense when the administration services are performed.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
A retirement benefit surplus is only recognised to the extent that it is expected to be recoverable in the future.
A defined contribution scheme is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions to a separate entity.
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as an accrual as at that date.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 85 87 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED CONTINUED For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 2 Accounting policies continued Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based awards to certain employees.
A fair value for the equity-settled share awards is measured at the date of grant.
The Group measures the fair value of each award using the Black-Scholes model where appropriate.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of awards that are expected to vest.
Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of awards that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the awards are exercised, the Company may, if permitted, issue new shares, or utilise shares held as treasury shares or those held within the Debenhams Retail Employee Trust.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs for new share issues are credited to share capital at nominal value and share premium when the awards are exercised.
Exceptional items Items which are both non-recurring and material in either size or nature are presented as exceptional items within their relevant income statement line.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better indication of underlying performance of the Group.
Foreign exchange a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Groups presentation currency.
b Group companies The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet.
Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transaction.
The resulting net exchange difference is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated as a separate component of equity.
c Transactions and balances Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation, at the balance sheet date exchange rate, of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the closing rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets such as equities classified as available-for-sale are included in other comprehensive income and accumulated as a separate component of equity.
86 88 Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial statements Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and the translation of inter company loans are presented in the income statement within finance income or costs, with the exception of foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to inter company loans classed as permanent equity which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within cost of sales.
Taxation Taxation expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Taxation which relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or equity is recognised in other comprehensive income or equity respectively.
Current tax is based on taxable profits for the financial period using tax rates that are in force during the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other financial years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
If deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversals of the temporary differences is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Leased assets a Finance leases Leases of assets which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are classified as a financial liability and measured at amortised cost.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments and depreciated over the useful economic life or the period of the lease.
The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
b Operating leases All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases, net of lease incentives, are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Where property lease contracts contain guaranteed fixed minimum incremental rental payments, the total committed cost is determined and is calculated and amortised on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Business combinations The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the consideration given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
All costs directly attributable to an acquisition are expensed to the income statement.
Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired in a subsidiary are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, provided they meet the conditions set out in IFRS 3 Business combinations revised.
The excess of cost over the Groups share of identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
If, after reassessment, the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of assets acquired, the excess is immediately recognised in the income statement.
Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 87 89 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED CONTINUED For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 2 Accounting policies continued Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired subsidiary.
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised but tested for impairment annually, or when trigger events occur, and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill represents the goodwill for a portfolio of sites which have been allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing on the basis of UK and other which is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
b Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are held at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Internally generated software costs, where it is clear that the software developed is technically feasible and will be completed and that the software generated will generate economic benefit, are capitalised as an intangible asset.
Included within intangible assets are assets in the course of construction.
These assets include directly attributable costs to bring the assets into use and may include capitalised borrowing costs.
Amortisation is provided at the following rates per annum to write off the costs of other intangible assets, less residual value, on a straight line basis from the date on which they are brought into use: Acquired licences and trademarks Up to 10.0% Internally generated software 10.0% to 33.3% Purchased software 10.0% to 33.3% Impairment testing Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill or intangible assets not ready for use, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped by store, which is the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have been impaired are reviewed at each reporting date for possible reversal of the impairment.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are held at historical purchase cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
This may include capitalised borrowing costs.
Depreciation is provided at the following rates per annum to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less residual value, on a straight line basis from the date on which they are brought into use: Freehold land Not depreciated Freehold buildings 1.0% Long leasehold land and buildings including landlords fixtures and fittings 1.0% or life of lease if shorter Short leasehold land and buildings including landlords fixtures and fittings Life of lease Retail fixtures and fittings 4.0% to 25.0% Office equipment 10.0% to 12.5% Computer equipment 10.0% to 33.3% Vehicles 20.0% Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount.
These are included in the income statement.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets in the course of construction.
These assets comprise stores which are under construction or modernisation, including costs directly attributable to bring the asset into use.
Transfers to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment are made when the store opens.
No depreciation is provided on stores or other assets under construction.
88 90 Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial statements Impairment testing Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to depreciation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Non-financial assets that have been impaired are reviewed at each reporting date for possible reversal of the impairment.
Capitalisation of finance costs Finance costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised to the cost of the asset, gross of tax relief.
Qualifying assets are those that necessarily take a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended use.
Available-for-sale investments Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date, being the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
The Group classifies its investments as available-for-sale financial assets in accordance with IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement IAS 39.
Available-for-sale financial investments are nonderivative assets that are either designated in this category or are not classified in the other financial instrument categories being Fair value through profit or loss or Loans and receivables.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus any transaction costs and subsequently at fair value.
The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices.
If the market for a financial asset and for unlisted securities is not active, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models, making maximum use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on entity specific inputs.
The fair value of available-for-sale investments denominated in a foreign currency is calculated in that foreign currency and translated at the closing rate at the reporting date.
Changes in the fair value of securities classified as available-for-sale are recognised in other comprehensive income.
An impairment test is performed annually on the carrying value of each investment.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value primarily using the retail method and represent goods for resale.
The retail method is an industry specific accounting method used to derive a weighted average product cost.
Product cost and retail values are aggregated at a departmental level to determine an average margin per department.
These margins are then applied to the retail value of inventory to derive the cost of the inventory.
Cost includes all direct expenditure and other attributable costs, net of volume and settlement supplier discounts, incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
This method intrinsically takes into account any stock loss or markdown to goods sold below cost.
Concession inventories are not included within inventory held by the Group.
Inventories on consignment at third parties are included within inventory held by the Group.
Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 89 91 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED CONTINUED For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 2 Accounting policies continued Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost less provisions for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at the bank and other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Transaction costs associated with borrowings are recognised initially at fair value and are amortised over the term of the facilities using the effective interest rate on the committed amount of each facility.
Debt repurchase The nominal value of debt repurchased is accounted for as a loan redemption, reducing net borrowings at the balance sheet date.
Trade payables Trade payables, defined as financial liabilities in accordance with IAS 39, are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
All of the trade payables are non-interest bearing.
Other payables and non-current liabilities Included within other payables are lease incentives received from landlords either through developers contributions or rent-free periods.
These incentives are credited to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Other payables also relate to the spreading of charges in respect of leases with fixed annual increments in rent escalating rent clauses over the term of the relevant lease.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and where it is more likely than not an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Derivatives Derivatives comprise interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as an effective hedging instrument and the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
90 92 Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial statements Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, the hedge relationship no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur or the Group fide-designates the hedge relationship.
The replacement or roll-over of a hedging instrument into another hedging instrument is not an expiration or termination if it formed part of the Groups documented hedging strategy from inception.
a Cash flow hedges The effective portion of the changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the relevant line of the income statement which will be affected by the underlying hedged item.
Forward foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges are fide-designated and subsequently classified as held for trading when the underlying forecast transaction is recognised in the financial statements.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified and adjusted against the initial measurement of the underlying hedged item when the underlying hedged item is recognised on the balance sheet or in the income statement.
When a hedged instrument expires, is sold or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued.
Any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is held in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately reclassified to the relevant line of the income statement which would have been affected by the forecast transaction.
b Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting Certain derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement within cost of sales or finance costs.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares in equity are shown as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where the Company purchases its own ordinary shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs together with the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
New standards and interpretations The following standards and amendments which apply for the first time in the current financial year and do not have a material impact on the consolidated financial information of the Group are as follows: Annual improvements to IFRSs: 2011 2013 Cycle Annual improvements to IFRSs: 2010 2012 Cycle Amendments to IAS 19 Employee benefits on defined benefit plans Amendment to IAS 32 Financial instruments: presentation on offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities Amendment to IAS 36 Impairment of assets on recoverable amount disclosures Amendment to IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement on novation of derivatives and hedge accounting Amendment to IFRS 10, 12 and IAS 27 Consolidation for investment entities IFRIC 21 Levies On 13 January 2016 the International Accounting Standards Board issued IFRS 16 Leases which is effective for periods that commence on or after 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a right-of-use asset for lease contracts, subject to limited exceptions for short-term leases and leases of low value assets.
The quantitative impact of IFRS 16 on the Groups net assets and results is being assessed.
IFRS 16 is expected to have a material impact on the balance sheet as both assets and liabilities will increase and is also expected to have a material impact on key components within the income statement because operating lease rental charges will be replaced by depreciation and finance costs.
IFRS 16 will not have any impact on the underlying commercial performance of the Group nor the cash flow generated in the year.

The CODM has been identified as the Executive Committee, which includes the executive directors and other key management.
It is the Executive Committee that has responsibility for planning and controlling the activities of the Group.
The Groups reportable segments have been identified as UK and International representing the geographical areas in which the Group operates.
The UK segment consists of the UK store and online retail business.
The International segment consists of subsidiaries in the Republic of Ireland and Denmark, together with international franchise and online operations.
Transactions within segments have been eliminated from the information presented below.
The segments are reported to the CODM to operating profit level, using the same accounting policies as applied to the Group accounts.
Current assets, current liabilities and non-current liabilities are not reported to or reviewed by the CODM on the basis of operating segment as these are reviewed on a Group-wide basis and therefore these amounts are not presented below.

Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 93 95 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED CONTINUED For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 5 Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Estimated impairment of goodwill The Group tests whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.
The recoverable amount of cash-generating units is determined based on a value-in-use calculation.
The method requires an estimate of future cash flows and the selection of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the net present value of the cash flows.
Actual outcomes could vary: see note 14 for further details.
Estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets At the date of capitalising property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, the Group estimates the useful life of the asset based on managements judgement and experience.
Due to the significance of capital investment to the Group, variances between actual and estimated useful economic lives could impact results both positively and negatively.
These margins are then applied to the retail value of inventory to derive the cost of inventory.
Retirement benefits The Groups defined benefit schemes pension surplus obligation, which is assessed each period by actuaries, is based on key assumptions including discount rates, mortality rates, inflation, future salary costs and pension costs.
These assumptions, individually or collectively, may be different to actual outcomes: refer to note 24 for further details.

2 Act 2015 the 2015 Act, which was enacted on 18 November 2015, included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 19.0% from 1 April 2017 and to 18.0% from 1 April 2020.
The effect of the reduction in the corporation tax rate enacted in the 2015 Act has been to reduce the net deferred tax liability recognised at the previous year end 29 August 2015 by approximately 2.3 million.
This 2.3 million decrease has been recognised in line with the treatment of the assets and liabilities giving rise to the net deferred tax liability.
Following the adoption of FRS 101 Reduced disclosure framework FRS 101 by Debenhams Retail plc and Debenhams Properties Limited in financial years 2015 and 2014 respectively, the remaining Debenhams Group companies based in the UK and Republic of Ireland changed their reporting framework from UK GAAP and GAAP in Ireland to FRS 101 at the beginning of the financial year.
FRS 101 is one of the new accounting frameworks being adopted by all companies throughout the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
A consequence of the adoption of FRS 101 is that income from lease incentives held in the subsidiaries is spread over a longer period than previously was the case under UK GAAP and GAAP in Ireland.
This has had no effect on the current taxation charge in this financial year.
On 31 August 2014 Debenhams Retail plc changed its reporting framework from UK GAAP to FRS 101 which resulted in a temporary reduction in the current taxation charge in the financial year ended 29 August 2015.
Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 97 99 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED CONTINUED For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 11 Taxation continued In the Chancellors Budget on 16 March 2016, he announced his intention to reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 17.0% from 1 April 2020.
As the change had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date its effect is not included in these financial statements.
The overall effect of this change, if it had applied to the deferred tax balance at the balance sheet date, would have been to reduce the deferred tax liability by 0.9 million and reduce the deferred taxation expense for the period by 0.9 million.
In addition, the corporation tax liability would have been reduced by 0.3 million and the current taxation expense for the period would have been reduced by 0.3 million.
In addition to the amount charged to the income statement, taxation movements recognised in other comprehensive income were as follows: 3 September 29 August 2016 2015 m m Taxation relating to items that will not be reclassified to the income statement Current taxation Pension schemes 2.3 2.2 Deferred taxation Remeasurements of pension schemes 5.8 5.8 Total taxation relating to items that will not be reclassified to the income statement 8.1 3.6 Taxation relating to items that may be reclassified to the income statement Deferred taxation Currency translation differences 0.6 0.4 Gains on cash flow hedges 1.8 6.0 Cash flow hedges reclassified and reported in the income statement 0.1 Recycled and adjusted against cost of inventory 0.2 0.3 Total taxation relating to items that may be reclassified to the income statement 1.5 6.7 Total taxation credit charge in other comprehensive income 6.6 10.3 12 Dividends 3 September 29 August 2016 2015 m m Final paid 2.4 pence 2015: 2.4 pence per 0.0001 share Settled in cash 29.5 29.4 Interim paid 1.025 pence 2015: 1.000 pence per 0.0001 share Settled in cash 12.5 12.3 42.0 41.7 A final dividend of 2.4 pence per share 2015: 2.4 pence per share was paid during the financial year in respect of the financial year ended 29 August 2015, together with an interim dividend of 1.025 pence per share 2015: 1.000 pence per share in respect of the financial year ended 3 September 2016.
The directors are recommending a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 3 September 2016 of 2.4 pence per share 2015: 2.4 pence per share, which will absorb an estimated 29.5 million 2015: 29.5 million of shareholders equity.
It will be paid on 24 January 2017 to shareholders who are on the register of members at close of business on 9 December 2016.
No liability is recorded in the financial statements in respect of the final dividend as it was not approved at the balance sheet date.
13 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial year, excluding any shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares, those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the financial year.

Impairment test for goodwill Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Goodwill represents the goodwill for a portfolio of sites, which has been allocated to cash-generating units CGUs according to the level at which management monitors that goodwill.
The CGUs are set out below: UK Other Total m m m Goodwill At 3 September 2016 793.5 25.4 818.9 At 29 August 2015 793.5 24.5 818.0 For the purposes of this impairment review, the recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period.
The three year plan is built up using managements previous experience and incorporates managements view of current economic conditions and trading expectations.
Management determined sales growth in the three-year period to be a key assumption.
The annual sales growth ranges from 0.0% to 4.0% during the three-year period.
Cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated based on the assumption of 2.0% 2015: 2.0% growth after year three.
The growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the retail sector in which the CGUs operate.
The post-tax discount rate used to calculate the value-in-use was 7.1% 2015: 7.5% and reflects the specific risks in the retail business.
10 102 0 Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial statements Management determined the gross margin for each CGU based on performance of individual stores and its expectations for the market development.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are post-tax and risk-free rates.
Based on the value-in-use calculations, there is substantial headroom against each of the operating segments and a reasonable change in the key assumption used would not cause an impairment to goodwill.
As a result of the impairment review, as at 3 September 2016 no impairment of goodwill has been required 2015: nil.

The board delegates its responsibility for reviewing and approving treasury policy to the Audit Committee.
Reports are prepared monthly covering all areas of treasury activity and policy compliance and are reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer.
The board and Audit Committee receive regular reports covering treasury activities and policy compliance.
Group treasury manages the Groups funding requirements and financial risks in line with the agreed treasury policies and procedures.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, primarily include borrowings, cash and liquid resources, availablefor-sale assets, trade receivables and trade payables.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage liquidity or raise finance for the Group.
Group treasury uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risks associated with the Groups financing and currency risk arising from the Groups operations.
The derivatives used are mainly interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, which include: Funding and liquidity risk Credit risk Foreign exchange risk Interest rate risk Other price risk The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows: i Funding and liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, debt finance and leases.
Group treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity requirements to ensure that it has a sufficient cash or working capital facility to meet the cash flow and covenant requirements of the Group and the current business plan.
Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above balances required for working capital management are transferred to Group treasury.
Group treasury invests surplus cash in interest bearing current accounts, term deposits, money market deposits and marketable securities, choosing instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to provide sufficient headroom as determined by the above-mentioned forecasts.

The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Sales to retail customers are made in cash or by credit and debit cards.
Wholesale sales of products are made to franchise partners with an appropriate credit history and, where possible, are covered by letters of credit and or credit insurance.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit-quality financial institutions.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
The Groups policy requires that cash surpluses are placed on deposit for no longer than three months and only with counterparties with a credit rating of BBBor Baa3 or higher as assigned by Standard & Poors or Moodys respectively.
Exceptions to this policy require Audit Committee approval.
The Group considers its maximum credit risk at 3 September 2016 to be 155.3 million 2015: 107.4 million being the Groups total financial assets.
Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 10 109 7 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED CONTINUED For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 22 Financial risk management continued iii Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar, the Euro, the Chinese yuan and the Danish krone.
To manage the foreign exchange transaction risk, entities in the Group use forward foreign currency contracts transacted by Group treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when commercial transactions are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group treasury is responsible for managing the exposure in each foreign currency by using external forward foreign currency contracts with a settlement of up to three 2015: three years.
Forecast cash flows are hedged to the extent that those cash flows are deemed highly probable.
The Group regularly reviews the need to hedge foreign exchange exposure arising from the financial results, assets and liabilities of its non-sterling businesses, hedging those exposures to the extent that they are considered appropriate for hedging.
The Group manages foreign exchange translation risk by entering into monthly foreign exchange swap contracts to offset month by month currency translation impacts within the Group, where appropriate.
During the current financial year, the Group closed out certain forward foreign currency contracts and reset the contracts to current market rates.
As a result of this transaction, cash amounting to 11.2 million was received.
This will be recycled from the hedging reserve as the contracts reach expiry.
A gain of 27.2 million 2015: 8.7 million was reclassified from equity to the income statement within cost of inventory during the year in respect of forward foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional value of open forward foreign currency contracts at 3 September 2016 was 547.5 million 2015: 634.7 million.
The net fair value gains on open forward foreign currency contracts held in the hedging reserve at 3 September 2016 were 38.3 million 2015: 24.3 million.
This will be recycled and adjusted against the initial measurement of the acquisition cost of inventory over the next three years.
During the current and prior financial years there were no contracts reclassified to held for trading due to cash flow hedges being ineffective.
iv Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowing facilities with debt issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
At 3 September 2016, Debenhams plc has in issue 200.0 million 2015: 200.0 million of senior notes at a coupon rate of 5.25% which reduces the Groups exposure to cash flow interest rate risk.
The interest exposure of the Group is managed within the constraints of the Groups business plan and the financial covenants under its facilities.
The aim is to reduce exposure to interest rate movements and to take advantage of low interest rates by hedging an appropriate amount of interest rate exposure whilst maintaining the flexibility to minimise early termination costs.
The Groups interest rate hedging strategy is to achieve a target fixed percentage of 75%, with a 15% tolerance 60% 90%.
The impact of movements in interest rates is managed through fixed debt and the use of interest rate swaps.
These are usually matched with specific loans for a period of time up to their maturity or call date.
The Groups main interest rate exposure is from the floating rate loans under the credit facilities.
At the year end the percentage of the Groups total borrowings subject to fixed interest rates either directly or as a result of hedging was 94.4% 2015: 91.2%.
This was temporarily outside the 60% - 90% policy range owing to the Groups working capital cycle but will revert to policy during the next 12 months.
10 110 8 Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial statements Interest rate swaps The Groups interest rate swaps switch interest from floating rates to fixed rates.
The Groups interest rate swap portfolio is summarised as follows: Notional Rate m % Maturity Interest rate swaps 120.0 1.050 1.125 October 2016 The notional principal amount of interest rate swaps at 3 September 2016 was 120.0 million 2015: 125.0 million.
The net gains and losses on these swaps, which are deferred in equity, will reverse through interest in the income statement over the life of the swaps.
During the financial year a loss of 0.8 million 2015: 1.6 million was reclassified and reported in the income statement in respect of interest rate swaps.
Borrowings and cash and cash equivalents The interest rate profiles of borrowings after taking account of interest rate swaps, swapped from floating to fixed rates, used to manage interest were as follows: 3 September 2016 29 August 2015 Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total m m m m m m 1 Sterling 323.6 15.5 339.1 328.2 28.3 356.5 1 Unamortised debt issue costs of 5.3 million 2015: 5.3 million are excluded from the borrowings above.
Fixed sterling borrowings comprise the hedged portion of the debt facility of 120.0 million 2015: 125.0 million, senior notes of 200.0 million 2015: 200.0 million and finance lease liabilities of 3.6 million 2015: 3.2 million at 3 September 2016.
The weighted average interest rate on the fixed rate borrowings as at 3 September 2016 was 4.2% 2015: 4.5%, with the weighted average time for which rates are fixed being 3.1 years 2015: 4.0 years.
Floating rate borrowings are interest bearing at interest rates based on LIBOR.
Cash deposits are interest bearing at rates based on LIBID or relevant base rates.
Non-interest bearing cash refers to cash in stores or in transit.
Floating rate borrowings have been classified as fixed if there were derivative financial instruments hedging the floating rate interest exposure.
The interest rate profiles of cash and cash equivalents were as follows: 3 September 2016 29 August 2015 Non-interest Non-interest Floating bearing Total Floating bearing Total m m m m m m Financial assets Sterling 3.4 29.5 32.9 25.3 25.3 Euro 0.3 4.6 4.9 0.1 3.3 3.4 US dollar 10.7 2.2 12.9 0.9 0.9 Danish krone 2.8 2.8 Chinese yuan 1.5 1.5 Other 1.3 1.3 1.6 1.5 3.1 Total financial assets 18.7 37.6 56.3 1.7 31.0 32.7 Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 10 111 9 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED CONTINUED For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 22 Financial risk management continued v Other price risk The Group is exposed to price risk arising from equity investments.
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at the reporting date.
At the year end, if the market value of equity investments had been 10% higher lower, when all other variables were held constant then: The income statement would have been unaffected as the equity investments were classified as available-for-sale investments Other reserves would decrease increase by 0.1 million 2015: 0.2 million for the Group as a result of the changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments The above movement in rates is considered to represent reasonable possible changes.
Other larger or smaller changes are also possible.
b Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, provide returns for shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders and maintain a structure to optimise the cost of capital.
The Group defines capital as debt and equity.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may consider the amount of dividend paid to shareholders, the return of capital to shareholders, the issue or sale of shares or the sale of assets to reduce debt.
The Group routinely monitors its capital and liquidity requirements through leverage ratios consistent with industry-wide borrowing standards, maintaining suitable headroom to the bank facility fixed charge, senior notes and leverage covenants together with credit market requirements to ensure that financing requirements continue to be serviceable.
c Fair value estimates The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts has been determined based on discounted market forward currency exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
In the case of the Groups loans due in more than one year, the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates available to the Group.
Note 23 shows the carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
d Sensitivity analysis The Group monitors interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk by determining the effect on profit and equity of a range of possible changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
The range of sensitivities chosen, being 1% movement in the interest rate or 5% movement in sterling when compared to the US dollar, Euro, Chinese yuan and Danish krone, reflects the Groups view of reasonably possible changes to these risk variables which existed at the year end.
The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the Group as a result of market movements in interest rates in relation to all the Groups financial instruments.
The analysis has been produced assuming no changes in the borrowings and existing interest rate swaps portfolio when considering the interest rate movement.

The carrying value of the Groups senior notes debt was 198.8 million 2015: 198.1 million and the fair value of this debt was 210.2 million 2015: 200.1 million.
During the previous financial year, the Group cancelled 30.0 million of interest rate swap contracts with a combined balance sheet liability value of 0.1 million.
Fair value measurement The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted based on active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 113 111 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED CONTINUED For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 23 Financial instruments continued The following table shows the Groups financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value: Level 1 Level 2 Total m m m At 3 September 2016 Assets Available-for-sale financial assets 1.3 1.3 Derivative financial instruments: Forward foreign currency contracts held as cash flow hedges 48.5 48.5 Other forward foreign currency contracts 1.3 1.3 Total assets 1.3 49.8 51.1 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments: Interest rate swaps held as cash flow hedges 0.2 0.2 Forward foreign currency contracts held as cash flow hedges 10.6 10.6 Other forward foreign currency contracts 0.5 0.5 Total liabilities 11.3 11.3 Level 1 Level 2 Total m m m At 29 August 2015 Assets Available-for-sale financial assets 2.1 2.1 Derivative financial instruments: Forward foreign currency contracts held as cash flow hedges 25.6 25.6 Other forward foreign currency contracts 3.9 3.9 Total assets 2.1 29.5 31.6 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments: Interest rate swaps held as cash flow hedges 0.7 0.7 Forward foreign currency contracts held as cash flow hedges 1.3 1.3 Other forward foreign currency contracts 0.4 0.4 Total liabilities 2.4 2.4 The Groups policy is to recognise transfers into and out of fair value hierarchy levels as at the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
There has been no transfer of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year.
None of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are classed as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
11 114 2 Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial statements 24 Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution pension schemes The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for its employees.
Group contributions to defined contribution pension schemes during the financial year were 15.5 million 2015: 14.7 million.
Defined benefit pension schemes The Group also operates defined benefit type pension schemes, being the Debenhams Executive Pension Plan DEPP and the Debenhams Retirement Scheme DRS together the Groups pension schemes, the assets of which are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The Groups pension schemes were closed to future service accrual from 31 October 2006.
The closure to future accrual will not affect the pensions of those who have retired or the deferred benefits of those who have left service or opted out before 31 October 2006.
The Groups pension schemes are established under trust law and each has a corporate trustee that is required to run the schemes in accordance with the schemes Trust Deed and Rules and to comply with the Pensions Act 2004 and all relevant legislation.
Responsibility for governance of the schemes lies with the trustee of each scheme.
Each corporate trustee is a company whose directors comprise of representatives: Appointed by the Group Nominated by scheme members The chair of both corporate trustees is independent from the schemes and from the Group.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Groups pension schemes was carried out at 31 March 2014 and has been used by KPMG LLP, a qualified independent actuary, when calculating the IAS 19 revised Employee benefits valuation at 3 September 2016.
In 2015, the Group agreed a recovery plan for the Groups pension schemes, which was intended to restore the schemes to a fully funded position on an ongoing basis.
Under that agreement, the Group agreed to contribute 9.5 million per annum to the pension schemes for the period from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2022 increasing by the percentage increase in RPI over the year to the previous December.
Additionally during 2015, the Group agreed to continue to cover the non-investment expenses and levies of the pension schemes, including those payable to the Pension Protection Fund.
Employees make no further contributions to the schemes.
By funding its defined benefit pension schemes, the Group is exposed to the risk that the cost of meeting its obligations is higher than anticipated.
This could occur for several reasons, for example: Investment returns on the schemes assets may be lower than anticipated, especially if falls in asset values are not matched by similar falls in the value of the schemes liabilities The level of price inflation may be higher than that assumed, resulting in higher payments from the schemes Scheme members may live longer than assumed Legislative changes could lead to an increase in the liabilities of the pension schemes Investment of the schemes assets is managed by Hewitt Risk Management Services Limited under a delegated consulting service agreement.
As at 3 September 2016 most of the schemes assets were invested in a delegated liability fund or a delegated growth fund.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 22 years 2015: 22 years.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 3 September 2016 29 August 2015 per annum per annum % % Inflation assumption 2.9 3.2 General salary and wage increase 2.9 3.2 Rate of increase in pension payments and deferred payments 2.9 3.2 Pension increase rate 2.8 3.0 Discount rate 2.1 3.8 Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 115 113 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED CONTINUED For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 For the financial year ended 3 September 2016 24 Retirement benefit schemes continued The inflation assumption is based on the RPI rate because pension increases, both in payment and deferment within the schemes, are set out with reference to this measure.
At the financial year end, the schemes assets were as follows: 3 September 2016 29 August 2015 Quoted Unquoted Total Quoted Unquoted Total m m m m m m Assets Delegated liability fund 215.5 215.5 158.4 158.4 Delegated growth fund 614.2 190.0 804.2 473.2 156.1 629.3 Cash and other assets 37.9 37.9 8.1 8.1 Total market value of assets 867.6 190.0 1,057.6 639.7 156.1 795.8 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,061.7 769.6 Net deficit surplus in schemes 4.1 26.2 Analysed as: DEPP scheme surplus 6.4 13.1 DRS scheme deficit surplus 10.5 13.1 At 3 September 2016, 82.0% 2015: 80.4% of investments were quoted on a recognised stock exchange or held in cash or assets readily convertible to cash and are therefore considered to be liquid.
The current life expectancies of a pensioner retiring aged 65 underlying the mortality tables for each of the schemes above are as follows: 3 September 2016 29 August 2015 Years Years Years Years Male Female Male Female Debenhams Retirement Scheme Member currently aged 65 22.1 24.4 22.0 24.3 Member aged 65 in 15 years 23.5 25.8 23.4 25.7 3 September 2016 29 August 2015 Years Years Years Years Male Female Male Female Debenhams Executive Pension Plan Member currently aged 65 24.1 26.3 24.1 26.2 Member aged 65 in 15 years 25.5 27.7 25.4 27.6 11 116 4 Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial statements Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligations are as follows: 3 September 29 August 2016 2015 m m Present value of obligations at start of the financial year 769.6 750.8 Current service cost including expenses 1.5 1.5 Interest cost on the defined benefit liability 28.7 28.6 Benefit payments from plan assets 30.6 27.1 Settlements 10.0 Remeasurements: Losses from changes in financial assumptions 312.4 34.8 Losses from changes in demographic assumptions 2.8 Experience gains 19.9 11.8 Present value of obligations at end of the financial year 1,061.7 769.6 Changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows: 3 September 29 August 2016 2015 m m Fair value of pension scheme assets at start of the financial year 795.8 748.4 Interest income on plan assets 29.8 28.7 Benefit payments from plan assets 30.6 27.1 Company contributions 11.2 11.1 Settlements 8.9 Remeasurements: Return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in finance costs 251.4 43.6 Fair value of pension scheme assets at end of the financial year 1,057.6 795.8 Movement in the net deficit surplus during the financial year is as follows: 3 September 29 August 2016 2015 m m Net surplus deficit in the schemes at start of the financial year 26.2 2.4 Movement in the financial year: Company contributions 11.2 11.1 Settlements 1.1 Current service cost including expenses 1.5 1.5 Net interest on net defined benefit asset liability 1.1 0.1 Remeasurements of pension schemes 41.1 17.8 Net deficit surplus in the schemes at end of the financial year 4.1 26.2 During the financial year ended 29 August 2015, DRS members were given the opportunity to take a trivial commutation payment which resulted in the recognition of a settlement credit of 1.1 million during that financial year.

3 September 29 August 2016 2015 m m Increase in schemes liabilities arising from a 0.5% increase in inflation 117.8 85.4 Increase in schemes liabilities arising from a 0.5% reduction in the discount rate 128.4 93.1 Increase in schemes liabilities arising from a one year increase in life expectancy 28.4 20.6 A 0.5% reduction in the inflation assumption, a 0.5% increase in the discount rate assumption and a one year reduction in the life expectancy assumption would result in an equal and opposite change in the schemes liabilities.
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be accumulated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the schemes liabilities to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when calculating the retirement benefit obligations surplus recognised within the balance sheet.
The contributions expected to be paid during the financial year ending 2 September 2017 amount to 11.3 million.

Grants under the PSP and SIP all comprise a right to acquire shares for no or nominal consideration.

An award under the PSP will normally vest on the third anniversary of date of grant and must be exercised within six months of vesting.
No payment is required for the grant of an award.
An award under the PSP comprises a right to receive free shares or a nil cost option with performance conditions attached.
i Awards granted on 1 November 2012 and 1 May 2013 The vesting of the shares granted under these awards was dependent upon the growth of both EPS and Return on Capital Employed ROCE.
75% of the awards were based upon EPS growth.
Where growth was less than 6% per annum over the three year performance period, this element of the awards would lapse.
Where growth was 6% per annum, 30% of the shares awarded would vest: where growth was 12% per annum, the EPS element of the awards would vest in full.
Between these two points, awards would vest on a straight line basis between 30% and 100%.
12 122 0 Debenhams plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial statements The remaining 25% of the awards were dependent upon ROCE.
If average ROCE was below the cost of capital plus 1% over the three year period, this element of the awards would lapse.
If average ROCE was equal to the cost of capital plus 1% over the three year period, then 30% of the shares awarded would vest.
If average ROCE was equal to the cost of capital plus 5% then the ROCE element of the awards would vest in full.
At 29 August 2015, the EPS element had not triggered vesting.
However ROCE had exceeded the cost of capital by 3.2%.
17% of the awards granted in November 2012 and May 2013 therefore vested in November 2015 and May 2016 respectively.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercises for the PSP awards exercised during the year was 87.9 pence.
ii Awards granted on 1 November 2014 and 1 May 2015 The vesting of the shares granted under these awards is dependent upon a combination of EPS growth and strategic measures with the strategic measures being subject to meeting a ROCE underpin.
70% of the awards are based upon EPS growth.
Where growth is less than 3% per annum over the performance period, this element of the awards lapses.
Where growth is 3% per annum, 25% of the shares awarded vest.
Where growth is 10% per annum, the EPS element of the awards vests in full.
Between these two points, awards vest on a straight line basis between 25% and 100%.
The remaining 30% of the awards are dependent upon the performance of the four strategic measures each with a maximum vesting of 7.5%.
The strategic measures are: Group gross margin improvement, online EBITDA growth rate, UK GTV growth and International EBITDA growth rate.
Each strategic measure is subject to a single performance test at the end of the performance period which will result in either vesting at 0% or in full 7.5% of the award.
If the Groups ROCE at the end of the applicable performance period is not greater than ROCE at the start of the applicable performance period the 30% of the awards subject to the strategic measures will not vest.
iii Awards granted on 3 November 2015, 3 May 2016 and 13 May 2016 The vesting conditions of the shares granted under these awards are the same as those applicable to the shares granted under the awards granted on 1 November 2014 and 1 May 2015.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payments, the vesting conditions attached to the PSP are classified as non-market conditions and therefore the shares have been fair valued at face value with a discount to take into account the non-entitlement to dividends in the vesting period where relevant.
The fair value of these PSP awards is calculated based on the Black-Scholes model assuming the inputs in the table below: 13 May 3 May 3 November Grant date 2016 2016 2015 Number of shares under award 14,884 391,897 5,706,023 Expected term years 3.0 3.0 3.0 Share price at grant pence 73.9 78.0 89.6 Exercise price pence Risk-free rate 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Expected volatility 0.0% 0.0% 100.0% Expected dividend yield 4.6% 4.4% 3.8% Fair value of award pence 64.4 68.4 80.0 Volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Companys share price is expected to fluctuate in the period.
Where volatility has been used in the calculation of the fair value of the award, it has been estimated by using the most recent historical share price volatility which is commensurate with the expected term of the option taking into account its contractual life.
b Share Incentive Plan The SIP allows the Company to grant options to key senior managers below board level, whom the Company wishes to retain and incentivise in the short to medium term.
Once the options have vested the employee has six months in which to exercise them.

In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payments, the vesting conditions attached to the SIP are classified as non-market conditions and therefore the shares have been fair valued at face value with a discount to take into account the nonentitlement to dividends in the vesting period where relevant.
The fair value of the SIP awards is calculated based on the Black-Scholes model assuming the inputs in the table below: 2 December Grant date 2015 Number of shares under award 150,000 Expected term years 2.0 Share price at grant pence 84.0 Exercise price pence Risk-free rate 0.0% Expected volatility 0.0% Expected dividend yield 4.1% Fair value of award pence 77.3 Volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Companys share price is expected to fluctuate in the period.
c Executive Share Option Plan The ESOP allowed the Company to grant options to acquire shares to eligible employees.
These options would normally become exercisable following a three-year performance period, only if and to the extent that the performance conditions to which they were subject had been satisfied.
Once the options had vested, the employees had a seven-year period in which to exercise.
Options were granted with an exercise price equal to the middle market value of the shares on the day immediately preceding the date of grant.
The options granted on 24 November 2009 became exercisable in full based on ROCE performance exceeding the cost of capital by 7.8% during the applicable performance period.
There are no unvested options under this plan.
The rules of this plan expired in 2016.
