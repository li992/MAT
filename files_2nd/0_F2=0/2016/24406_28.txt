Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies Accounting policies applicable across the financial statements are shown below.
Accounting policies that are specific to a component of the financial statements have been incorporated in the relevant note.
a Basis of preparation Grainger plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
It is a public limited liability company listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries, together referred toas the Group, and equity account the Groups interest in joint ventures and associates.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company and not the Group.
These financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2016 have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has prepared its company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101 for the first time this year.
Details of the change in basis of preparation and its impact are shown in Note 1 to the parent company financial statements.
These are presented on pages 159 to 167.
The accounting policies set out below and in the notes to the financial statements, have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in the Group financial statements.
Other than the new accounting policy for construction contracts, set out in Note 8, no new accounting policies have been adopted in the year and there has been no change to the basis of accounting estimates in the year.
The Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the following assets and liabilities, and corresponding income statement accounts, which are stated at their fair value: investment property, derivative financial instruments, financial interest in property assets and assets classified as held-for-sale.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income andexpenses.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the events and amounts involved, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in Note 2. b Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fideconsolidated from the date control ceases.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
100 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements ii Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established bycontractual agreement.
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence butnot control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Where the Group owns less than 50% of the voting rights but acts as property and or asset manager an assessment is made as to whether or not the Group has fide facto control over an investee.
This includes a review of the Groups rights relative to those of another investor or investors and the ability the Group has to direct the investees relevant activities further detail is provided in Note 19.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised atcost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the Groups share of the profit or loss after the date of acquisition.
The Groups share of its joint ventures and associates post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Where the Groups interest has been reduced to nil, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in joint ventures and associates.
The accounting policies of joint ventures and associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
iii Business combinations At the time of acquisition, the Group considers whether each acquisition represents theacquisition of abusiness or the acquisition of an asset.
The Group accounts for an acquisition as a business combination where an integrated setofactivities are acquired in addition to the property.
When the acquisition of asubsidiary does not represent a business, itisaccounted for as an acquisition of asset and liabilities.
The cost of acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquiredbasedon their fair values, and no goodwill or deferred tax is recognised.
iv Goodwill and impairment Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of theacquisition ismeasured as the fair value of the assets given and equity instruments issued.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Goodwillrepresents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair valueof the Groups share of net identifiable assets including intangible assets of the acquired entity at the date ofacquisition.
If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value ofthe net assets of the subsidiary acquired, thedifference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Costs attributable to anacquisition are expensed inthe consolidated income statement under the heading Other expenses.
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included within this caption on the statement of financial position.
Goodwill on acquisition of joint ventures and associates is included in investments in joint ventures and associates.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entitysold.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 101 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued c Foreign currencies i Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the Groups functional and presentation currency.
ii Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the dates ofthe transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at thestatement of financial position date aretranslated into Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions are recognised in theincomestatement.
iii Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the statement of financial position date.
Revenues andexpenses of foreign operations are translated at average foreign exchange rates for therelevant period.
Foreign exchange gains and losses, net of deferred income tax, are recognised within other comprehensive income.
iv Net investment hedges Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income within the translation reserve as part of retained earnings.
Any gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement within Finance costs.
Gains and losses accumulated inequity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
d Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting standards and interpretations There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations that are effective for the first time for the current financial year that have a material impact on the Group.
The Group is assessing the impact of the following revised standards and interpretations that are not yet effective.
Where already endorsed by the EU, these changes will be adopted on the effective dates noted.
Where not yet endorsed by the EU the adoption date is less certain.
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012 2014, effective 2017 financial year: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement, effective 2019 financial year not yet endorsed by the EU : IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective 2018 financial year not yet endorsed by the EU : IFRS 16 Leases, effective 2020 financial year not yet endorsed by the EU.
This standard replaces the exisiting standard, IAS17 Leases, where lessees are required to make a distinction between a finance lease on balance sheet and an operating lease off balance sheet : and IAS 40 Investment Property, proposed amendment.
In November 2015 the IASB issued an Exposure Draft on a proposed amendment to clarify situations in which properties can be transferred from investment property to trading property and vice versa.
The IASB further announced in July 2016 that it has now recommended finalising this amendment.
The Group anticipate that a number of trading properties will be reclassified as investment property as a consequence of the amendment.
Of the other IFRSs that are available for early adoption, none are expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
102 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements 2 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions The Groups significant accounting policies are stated in the relevant notes to the financial statements.
Not all of these accounting policies require management to make subjective or complex judgements or estimates.
The following is intended toprovide further detail relating to those accounting policies that management consider critical because of the level of complexity, judgement orestimation involved in their application and their impact on the consolidated financial statements.
The Group performs sensitivity analysis as part of the risk management process and we have set out below on page 106 the impact of changes to key assumptions adopted.
Valuation of residential property The Groups residential trading property is carried in the statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
TheGroups investment property is carried in the statement of financial position at fair value.
The Group does, however, in its principal non-GAAP net asset value measures, EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV, include trading stock at market value.
The market value of the Groups property which, in the case of investment property, is the same as fair value is detailed below.
The results and the basis of each valuation and their impact on both the statutory financial statements and market value for the Groups non-GAAP net asset value measures are set out below: % of properties for which external valuer Financial provides Residential Development Others Asset Total valuation m m m m m % Trading property 818.8 85.5 904.3 Investment property 261.3 261.3 Financial asset CHARM 93.1 93.1 Total statutory book value 1,080.1 85.5 93.1 1,258.7 Allsop LLP Residential 1,225.1 1,225.1 53% Grainger Invest 366.7 366.7 100% Tricomm Housing 116.1 116.1 100% Financial asset CHARM 93.1 93.1 CBRE Limited Developments 78.2 78.2 94% Abbeville Apartments 28.9 28.9 100% Total assets at market value 1,736.8 78.2 93.1 1,908.1 Trading property 1,475.5 78.2 1,553.7 Investment property 261.3 261.3 Financial asset 93.1 93.1 Total assets at market value 1,736.8 78.2 93.1 1,908.1 Statutory book value 1,080.1 85.5 93.1 1,258.7 Market value uplift 656.7 7.3 649.4 Total assets at market value 1,736.8 78.2 93.1 1,908.1 Net revaluation gain recognised in the income statement for wholly-owned properties continuing 20.3 20.3 Net revaluation gain relating to joint ventures and associates 12.3 12.3 Net revaluation gain recognised in the year continuing 20.3 12.3 32.6 The market value uplift is the difference between the statutory book value and the market value of the Groups inventories.
Refer to Note 5 for market value net assetmeasures.
Includes Group share of joint ventures and associates revaluation gain after tax.
Allsop provides vacant possession values used by the Directors to value the financial asset in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 21.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 103 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued i Residential The Groups own in-house qualified surveying team provided a vacant possession value for the majority of the Groups UK residential properties asat 30 September 2016.
A structured sample of these in-house valuations was reviewed by Allsop LLP, an external independent valuer.
Valuing the large number of properties in the portfolio is a significant task.
For this reason, it is undertaken on an external inspection basisonly.
Invariably, when the in-house valuations are compared to those of the external valuer, around 75% of the valuations are within a small acceptable tolerance.
Where the difference is more significant this is discussed with the valuer to determine the reasons for the difference.
Typically, the reasons vary but it could be, for example, that further or better information about internal condition is available or that respective valuers have placed a different interpretation on comparable sales.
Once such reasons have been identified the Group and the valuer agree the appropriate valuation that should be adopted as the Directors valuation.
Overall, across all of the properties valued by Allsop LLP, the Directors valuations were approximately 0.03% lower than the AllsopLLPvalues.
Allsop LLP has provided the Directors with the following opinion on the Directors valuation: Property held in the UK Residential portfolio was valued as at 30 September 2016 by Graingers in-house surveyors.
These valuations were reviewed and approved bythe Directors.
Allsop LLP has undertaken a comprehensive review of the Directors valuation and they are satisfied with the process by which the in-house valuations were conducted.
As part of the review, Allsop LLP valued approximately 53% of the UKResidential portfolio, independently of the Group.
Based on the results of that review, Allsop LLP has concluded that they havea high degree of confidence in those Directors valuations.
Allsop LLP also recommend the discount to apply to the vacant possession valuations to establish the market value of each property.
For property in the UK Residential portfolio the discounts are established by tenancy type and are based on evidence gathered by Allsop LLP from recent transactional market evidence.
After due consideration and challenge of Allsop LLP, the Directors have adopted all of the recommendations made by Allsop LLP in relation to the discounts.
Compared to the discounts adopted in 2015, the discounts adopted in 2016 have increased the market value of trading stock in the Groups non-GAAP net asset measures by 8.0m and increased the valuation gain in the income statement by 1.8m.
ii Grainger Invest GInvest All of the property owned by the Group in the GInvest portfolio was valued as at 30 September 2016 by Allsop LLP.
The market values of the properties subject to the assumption that the dwellings would be sold individually, which is deemed to bethe highest and best use, in their existing condition, and subject to any existing leases or tenancies was provided by Allsop LLP.
The valuers opinion of market value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arms-length terms.
iii Tricomm Housing Allsop LLP has also valued as at 30 September 2016 the property assets owned by the Group and let under a long-term lease arrangement with the Secretary of State for Defence under a PFI Project Agreement.
Allsop LLP has provided an Investment Valuation which is defined as the value of an asset to the owner or a prospective owner for individual investment or operational objectives.
The Investment Valuation has been made in accordance with RICS Professional Valuation Standards, and is based on a discounted cash flow model.
Significant unobservable inputs within the valuation relate to assumptions for house price inflation and the discount rates to apply to the cash flows.
The assumptions adopted for house price inflation are 2.5% in 2017, 3.5% in 2018 and 2019, 3.0% in 2020 and 2021 and 2.75% thereafter.
The discount rates applied to the cash flows range between 3.5% and 9.25%.
104 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements iv CBRE Development The current market value of the Groups land and property held within the development segment has been assessed by CBRE Limited who are external independent valuers.
Their valuation, representing 94% of the total value of development trading stock, is on the basis of fair value as defined in the RICS Professional Valuation Standards where fair value is the same as market value.
The remaining 6% of the portfolio is a Directors valuation.
v CBRE Abbeville Apartments CBRE have also assessed the current market value of the Abbeville Apartments.
The principal approach was to value the apartments on an income capitalisation basis, having regard to prevailing market conditions and evidence, and with close regard to the relativity between the Market Value and the aggregate vacant possession value.
The valuation has been preparedin accordance with RICS Professional Valuation Standards where fair value is the same as market value.
v Joint ventures and Associates Property assets in the joint venture Walworth Investment Properties Limited WIP are valued on the same basis as the GInvest portfolio.
Property assets in the associate, GRIP REIT Plc were valued at 30 June 2016 by external valuers, CBRE Limited.
In aggregate, the valuation of the individual dwellings as at 30 June 2016 was 599.9m for all assets still held at September.
After full consideration of house price movements in those areas where GRIP property assets are situated theGroups Directors made no adjustment to the 30 June 2016 valuations based on the movement in house price indices to30September 2016, in assessing the Groups share of GRIP net assets for the purposes of the Groups accounts to 30September 2016.
The Directors consider the valuations provided by external valuers to be representative of fair value.
As required by RICS Valuation Professional Standards, all of the external valuers in the UK mentioned above have made full disclosure of the extent and duration of their work for, and fees earned by them from, the Group, which in all cases are less than 5% of their total fees.
Valuation of financial interest in property assets CHARM The valuation methodology adopted for the CHARM asset is set out in Note 21 to the accounts.
Thekey assumptions affecting the carrying value are house price inflation and the discount rate.
The assumptions used to value the asset adopt an increase in house prices of between 2.5% and 4.0% per annum.
A discount rate of 3.5% has been applied to the interest income and a rate of 6.5% has been applied to the projected proceeds from sales of the underlying properties, reflecting the risk profile of each individual stream.
In previous years, a single discount rate had been adopted.
The fair value of the interest changes as cash flows are realised and an increase of 2.9m 2015: increase of nil in the fair value has been recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income and the available-for-sale reserve.
Credit risk arises from the credit exposure relating to cash receipts from the financial instrument.
All of the cash receipts are payable by the Church Commissioners, a counterparty considered to be low risk as they have no history of past due or impaired amounts and there are no past due amounts outstanding at the year end.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 105 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued Net realisable value of trading property The Groups residential trading properties are carried in the statement of financial position at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
As the Groups business model is to sell trading stock on vacancy, net realisable value is the net sales proceeds which the Group expects on sale of a property with vacant possession.
The Group has a net realisable value provision of 3.2m as at 30 September 2016 2015: 2.3m to write down the value of its trading properties to the lower of cost and net realisable value.
This provision relates primarily to properties expected to be sold ultimately at vacant possession value.
The provision includes specific properties which are vacantand properties we expect to become vacant on the assumption of an annual vacancy rate of 7.3%.
After releasing part of the opening provision against sales made in the year, in aggregate, a charge of 2.7m has been made inthe 2016 income statement 2015: charge of 1.2m.
For land and property held within the Development segment of the business, net realisable value is the expected net sales proceeds of the developed property and a provision is made when, and to the extent that, total projected project costs exceed total projected project revenues.
Where land and property is sold without development, net realisable value is the current market value net of associated sellingcosts.
Decisions regarding whether to develop a site or to sell a site undeveloped are made by the Directors based on market conditions prevailing at the time.
A charge of 0.1m has been made in the 2016 income statement 2015: charge of 0.2m in adjusting the book value of development stock to net realisable value.
The impact of changes to key assumptions is set out in the table below: 2016 2015 Statement Statement Income of financial Income of financial statement position statement position impact impact impact impact m m m m Increase of 1% in house prices GRIP 1.5 1.5 1.3 1.3 Decrease of 1% in house prices GRIP 1.5 1.5 1.3 1.3 Increase of 1% in house prices NRV provision 0.1 0.1 Decrease of 1% in house prices NRV provision 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Increase of 1% in house prices CHARM 0.7 4.8 0.7 5.5 Decrease of 1% in house prices CHARM 0.7 4.4 0.7 5.1 Increase of 1% in discount rate CHARM 6.6 6.4 Decrease of 1% in discount rate CHARM 7.5 7.4 Distinction between investment and trading property The Group considers the intention at the outset when each property is acquired in order to classify the property as either an investment ora trading property.
Where the intention is to either trade the property or where the property is held for immediate sale upon receiving vacant possession within the ordinary course of business, the property is classified as trading property.
Where the intention is to hold the property for its long-term rental yield and or capital appreciation, the property is classified asan investment property.
106 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements Derivative financial instruments Fair value measurements for derivative financial instruments are obtained from quoted market prices and or valuation modelsasappropriate.
When not directly observable in active markets, the fair value of derivative contracts must be computed internally based on internal assumptions as well as directly observable market information, including forward and yield curves for commodities, currencies and interest.
Changes in internal assumptions and forward curves could materially impact the internally computed fair value of derivative contracts, particularly long-term contracts, resulting in corresponding impact on income or loss in the consolidated income statement.
The Group utilises an external independent valuer, J C Rathbone Associates Limited, to provide recommendations on the internal assumptions which have been fully adopted by the Directors.
Accounting for unusual contracts In 2012, the Group entered into a contractual arrangement to build PRS properties on behalf of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea RBKC.
The Group will manage and fund the construction of a number of sites, and will receive adevelopers priority return from the sale of units to third parties as they are completed.
The construction contract is being accounted for as a cost plus contract in line with International Accounting Standard 11 Construction Contracts.
Revenue of24.1m has been recognised in the year but, as the project is in the early stage of development, no trading profit has yet beenrecorded.
Once completed, under a separate arrangement, Grainger will manage the retained units on behalf of RBKC.
Adjusted earnings Adjusted earnings is one of Graingers key performance indicators.
The metric is utilised as a key measure to aid understanding of the performance of the continuing business and excludes valuation movements and non-recurring items that are one-off in nature, which do not form part of the normal ongoing revenue or costs of the business and, either individually or in aggregate, are material to the reported Group results.
The classification of amounts as non-recurring is a significant judgement made by management and is a matter referred to the Audit Committee for approval.
Non-recurring in 2016 primarily comprises a 10.7m profit from our investment in Prague, restructuring costs of 2.6m, anadditional provision of 1.3m relating to the provision of a pension and BUPA medical cover to former employees of thecompany and BPT Limited, and income of 0.8m related to the outcome of a claim against a contractor.
As the business simplifies, managements view is that the need for items to be classified as non-recurring will reduce.
Going concern The Directors are required to make an assessment of the Groups ability to continue to trade as a going concern for the foreseeable future.
The Directors have given this matter due consideration and have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group financial statements on a going concern basis.
The main considerations were as follows: i Covenant compliance The Groups core banking facility has two covenants, being loan-to-value LTV and interest cover.
At 30 September 2016, the LTV was 35.9% compared to a default level of 75% and the interest cover ratio was 3.86 times compared to aminimum requirement of 1.35 times.
The Group has other bank debt and a 275m corporate bond on which there are alsocovenant requirements.
As at 30 September 2016, the Group is operating comfortably within these requirements.
TheDirectors have reviewed the Groups financial projections covering a minimum period of at least 12 months beyond thedate of signing of these financial statements, and which include covenant compliance forecasts.
These projections showthat theGroup will comfortably meet its covenant requirements.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 107 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions continued ii Banking facilities The Groups existing core facilities were 580.0m on 30 September 2016, of which 302.1m were drawn.
The Group had freecash balances plus available overdraft of 43.1m and undrawn committed facilities of 277.9m, in total, headroom, of 321.0m at 30September 2016.
The Directors have reviewed the available headroom of the Group, and confirmed that even without any further management actions, the Group has sufficient resources to meet future repayments as they fall due.
As has been demonstrated over the past few years, the Group is able to generate strong cash flows even in very difficult general market conditions.
The Groups cash flow projections confirm that the Group will remain well within its facilities for aminimum period of at least 12 months beyond the date of signing of these financial statements.
In addition, as set out on page 34, the Directors have considered the Groups viability in detail over a four-year period to September 2020.
3 Discontinued operations Accounting Policy Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group and which: represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations: or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale.
For the discontinued operation, the comparable statement of profit or loss and OCI has been re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.
Assets held for sale Assets are classified as held-for-sale, as defined by IFRS 5, when the assets are available-for-sale in their present condition, the sale ishighly probable and it is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.
Non-current assets classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets and liabilities classified as held-for-sale are presented separately as current items in the statement of financial position.
Onre-classification, investment property that is measured at fair value continues to be measured at fair value.
The Group identified certain of its investment properties as held-for-sale in 2016 in accordance with the criteria set out inIFRS 5.
During the financial year, the Group has disposed of the Retirement Solutions division, other than the CHARM portfolio which has been retained, and the majority of the German operations.
These operations have been classified as discontinued and the prior period consolidated income statement, and where appropriate, related supporting notes to the financial statements, have been restated to exclude these operations.
The Retirement Solutions business has been classified as a discontinued operation despite the retention of the CHARM assets as these are clearly distinguishable cash flows.
108 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements Retirement Solutions Completion of the sale of Graingers Retirement Solutions business, to Patron Capital Partners and Electra Private Equity plc took place on 18 May 2016.

5 Segmental information Accounting Policy IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified based upon the Groups internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM so that the CODM can make decisions about resources to be allocated to segments and assess their performance.
The Groups CODM is the Chief Executive Officer.
Following the disposal of the Retirement Solutions and German Residential operations, the three significant segments for continuing operations are outlined below.
Residential: Development: and Funds The two segments Retirement Solutions and German Residential, which are now classified as discontinued, are combined and analysed in Note 3.
The title Other has been included in the tables below to reconcile the segments to the figures reviewed by the CODM.
The key operating performance measure of profit or loss used by the CODM is adjusted earnings before tax, valuation and non-recurring items.
The CODM reviews by segment two key balance sheet measures of net asset value.
These are EPRA Net Asset Value EPRA NAV and EPRA Triple Net AssetValue EPRA NNNAV.
Information relating to the Groups operating segments is set out in the tables below.
The tables distinguish between adjusted earnings, valuation and non-recurring items and should be read in conjunction with Note 4.

Segmental revenue from external customers for continuing operations is all derived from UK customers.
Non-current assets other than financial instruments and deferred tax assets are located as follows: 541.6m within the UK 2015: 469.3m.
Segmental assets The majority of the Groups properties are held as trading stock and are therefore shown in the statutory statement of financial position atthe lower of cost and net realisable value.
This does not reflect the market value of the assets and, accordingly, our key statement of financial position measures of net asset value include trading stock at market value.
The two principal net asset value measures reviewed by the CODM are EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV.
NAV is the statutory net assets plus the adjustment required to increase the value of trading stock from its statutory accounts value ofthelower of cost and net realisable value, to its market value.
In addition, the statutory statement of financial position amounts for both deferred tax on property revaluations and derivative financial instruments net of deferred tax, including those in joint ventures and associates, are added back to statutory net assets.
Finally, the market value of Grainger plc shares owned by the Group are added back tostatutory net assets.
NNNAV reverses some of the adjustments made between statutory net assets and NAV.
All of the adjustments for the value ofderivative financial instruments net of deferred tax, including those in joint ventures and associates, are reversed.
The adjustment for the deferred tax on property revaluations is also reversed.
In addition, adjustments are made to net assets toreflect the fair value, net of deferred tax, of the Groups fixed rate debt and to deduct from net assets the contingent tax calculated by applying the expected rate of tax to the adjustment to increase the value of trading stock from its statutory accounts value of the lower of cost and net realisable value, to its market value.
These measures are set out below by segment along with a reconciliation to the summarised statutory statement of financialposition.

14 Tax Accounting Policy The taxation charge for the year represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The charge is recognised in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
Current tax payable or receivable is based on the taxable income for the period and any adjustment in respect of prior periods and iscalculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Tax payable upon the realisation of revaluation gains recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with arelease ofthe associated deferred tax.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will give rise to a future tax liability against which the deferred tax assets can be recovered.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

This contingent tax, which is not provided in thefinancial statements, amounts to 110.4m 2015: 137.5m.
It is not possible for the Group to identify the timing of movements in deferred tax between those expected within one year andthose expected in greater than one year.
This is because movements in the main balances, both assets and liabilities, will bedetermined by factors outside the control of the Group, namely the vacation date of properties and interest yield curve movements.
However, given thelong-term nature of our property ownership, we anticipate that the balance will predominantly be crystallised in a period greater thanone year.

Factors that may affect future tax charges Changes to the main rate of corporation tax, which falls to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April 2020, have been reflected in the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
In addition, a number of changes to the UK corporate tax system have been proposed and will be reflected in the Groups tax accounts, as required, once substantively enacted.
15 Dividends Accounting Policy Dividends are recognised through equity when approved by the Companys shareholders or on payment, whichever is earlier.

124 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements 16 Earnings per share Accounting Policy Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the owners of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Group and held both in Trust and as treasury shares to meet its obligations under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, Deferred Bonus Plan DBP and SAYE schemes, on which the dividends are being waived.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares in issue by the dilutive effect of ordinary shares that the Company may potentially issue relating to its share option schemes and contingent share awards under the LTIP and DBP, based upon the number of shares that would be issued if 30 September 2016 was the end of the contingency period.
Where the effect of the above adjustments is antidilutive, they are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs.
After initial recognition, investment property is carried at fair value.
Fair value is based on active market prices, adjusted, ifnecessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specified asset.
If this information is notavailable, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash flow projections.
Investment property falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined by IFRS 13.
Furtherdetails are given in Note 28.
Subsequent expenditure is included in the carrying amount of the property when it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the Groups investment properties are included in the income statement of the period in which they arise.
Where specific investment properties are expected to sell within the next 12 months their fair value is shown under assets classified as held-for-sale within current assets.
Any loss on the reclassification of these assets from investment properties toassets held-for-sale ischarged to the income statement of the period in which this occurs.

Subsequent to initial recognition, the net change in value recorded is as follows: i the carrying value of the assets is increased by the effective interest rate: ii Cash received from the instrument in the year is deducted from the carrying value ofthe asset: and iii the carrying value of the assets is revised to the net present value of the updated projected cash flows arising from the instrument using the effective interest rate applicable at acquisition.
The change in value arising fromi and iii above is recorded through the income statement and is shown on the line Income from financial interest in property assets.
Differences between the updated projected cash flows using the effective interest rate applicable at acquisition compared toupdated projected cash flows using a year end effective interest rate, assessed as the rate available in the market for an instrument with a similar maturity and credit risk, are taken through other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the assets.
When gains or losses in the assets are realised, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included in the income statement as gains and losses from financial interest in property assets.

A provision for impairment in trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.

28 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments Accounting Policies Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative instruments to help manage its interest rate risk.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does nothold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
Derivatives are classified as current assets and current liabilities.
The derivatives are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequently, the gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting in which caseany gain or loss istaken to equity in a cash flow hedge reserve via other comprehensive income.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an on-going basis.
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highlyeffective.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, anycumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecasted transaction isultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected tooccur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Fair value estimation The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on a discounted cash flow model using market information.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Derecognition is the point at which the Group removes an asset or a liability from its statement of financial position.
The Groups policy is to derecognise financial assets only when the contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset expires.
The Group also derecognises financial assets that it transfers to another party provided that the transfer of the assets also transfers the right to receive cash flows from the financial asset.
When the transfer does not result in the Group transferring the right to receive cash flows from the financial asset but it does result in the Group assuming a corresponding obligation to pay cash flows to another recipient, thefinancial asset is derecognised.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities only when its obligation is discharged, is cancelled or expires.
Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are the financial interest in property assets.
Derivative financial instruments not in hedge accounting relationships are classified as fair value through profit and loss.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 137 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued Categories of financial instruments A summary of the classifications of the financial assets and liabilities held by the Group is set out in the following table: 2016 Loans and Assets at receivables fair value cash and through Derivatives cash profit used for AvailableTotal book Fair value equivalents and loss hedging for-sale value Fair value adjustment m m m m m m m Non-current assets Financial interest in property assets 93.1 93.1 93.1 Current assets Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments 57.3 57.3 57.3 Derivative financial instruments 0.3 0.3 0.3 Cash and cash equivalents 90.7 90.7 90.7 Total financial assets 148.0 0.3 93.1 241.4 241.4 Loans and Liabilities at Other receivables fair value financial cash and through Derivatives liabilities at cash profit and used for amortised Total book Fair value equivalents loss hedging cost value Fair value adjustment m m m m m m m Non-current liabilities Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 744.7 744.7 771.5 Current liabilities Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 99.0 99.0 99.0 Trade and other payables 38.4 38.4 38.4 Derivative financial instruments 13.1 13.1 13.1 Total financial liabilities 13.1 882.1 895.2 922.0 Total net financial assets liabilities 148.0 0.3 13.1 789.0 653.8 680.6 The fair value difference relates to the Groups Corporate Bond, which is stated at amortised cost in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The fair value of the bond is calculated as 301.8m 2015: 283.0m.
There is no requirement under IAS 39 to revalue these loans to fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Included in cash above is 10.7m 2015: 10.6m relating to cash held on behalf of tenants, leaseholders and clients comprising Service Charge amounts, Sinking Fund balances, tenant deposits and cash held on behalf of joint ventures.
These cash amounts are held by the Group as agent in separate ring-fenced client bank accounts and are excluded from net debt.
In addition 37.9m 2015: 39.8m of the cash balance is restricted in use by underlying financing arrangements comprising either reserve fund amounts or amounts where the release of cash is contingent upon proof of qualifying expenditure.

The Groups policies on financial risk management are approved by the Board of Directors and implemented by Group treasury.
Written policies and procedures cover interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance is monitored by internal audit.
Group treasury reports to the Audit Committee.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to financial risk but does not take positions for speculativepurposes.
The sources of financial risk and the policies and activities used to mitigate each are discussed below and include credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, which includes interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit availability risk, house price risk in relation to the Tricomm Housing portfolio and the CHARM portfolio, our financial interest in property assets, and capital risk.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss due to a counterpartys failure to honour its obligations.
The Groups principal financial assets include its financial interest in property assets, bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 139 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued The Groups financial interest in property assets relates to a financial interest in equity mortgages held by the Church of England Pensions Board.
The Groups cash receipts are payable by the Church Commissioners, a counterparty considered tobelow risk as they have no history of past due or impairedamounts and there are no past due amounts outstanding at theyear end.
The Group sometimes enters into sales contracts within the Development division under which a proportion of the consideration is deferred.
Each purchaser is subject to financial due diligence prior to sale and the Group retains a legal charge over the land until full and final settlement is received.
At 30 September 2016, nil 2015: nil was outstanding.
The Group also has credit risk relating to trade receivables.
Where it is identified that recovery is doubtful, a provision for impairment ismade.
For all Assured Shorthold Tenancies, credit checks are performed prior to acceptance of the tenant.
Regulated tenants are incentivised through the benefit of their tenancy agreement to avoid default on their rent.
Lifetime tenancies are generally at low or zero rent and hence suffer minimal credit risk.
Rent deposits and personal guarantees are held in respect of some leases.
Taking these factors into account, the risk to the Group of individual tenant default and the credit risk of trade receivables is considered low, as is borne out by the low level of trade receivables written off both in this year and in prior years.
Tenant deposits of 2.0m 2015: 1.5m are held which provide some security against rental arrears and property dilapidations caused by the tenant.
The Group does not hold any other collateral as security.
Of the net trade receivables balance of 2.6m, we consider Nil to be not due and not impaired.
We consider that all of the 4.2m other receivables balance, and all of the 50.5m amounts recoverable on contracts as not due and not impaired.
As at 30 September 2016, tenant arrears of 0.5m within trade receivables were impaired and fully provided for 2015: 1.8m.
The individually impaired receivables are based on a review of outstanding arrears and an assessment of collectability.
Impaired receivables and receivables not considered to be impaired are not material to the financial statements and, therefore, no further analysis is provided.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is managed through the Groups policies of monitoring counterparty exposure, monitoring the concentration of credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties and the use of counterparties of good financial standing.
At 30 September 2016, the fair value of all interest rate derivatives that had a positive value was 0.3m 2015: 2.0m.
At 30 September 2016, the combined credit exposure arising from cash held at banks, money market deposits and interest rate swaps was 80.3m 2015: 80.2m, which represents 5.0% 2015: 4.7% of total assets.
Deposits were placed with financial institutions with Aor better credit ratings.
The Group has the following cash and cash equivalents: 2016 2015 m m Pounds Sterling 79.4 83.5 Euros 11.3 5.3 90.7 88.8 At the year end, 42.3m was placed on deposit 2015: 23.4m at effective interest rates between 0.2% and 0.3% 2015: 0.4% and 0.5%.
Remaining cash and cash equivalents are held as cash at bank or in hand.
The Group has an overdraft facility of 1.0m as at 30 September 2016 2015: 1.0m.
140 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements Liquidity risk The Group ensures that it maintains continuity and flexibility through a spread of maturities.
Although the Groups core funding is supported by covenants requiring certain levels of loan to value with respect to the entities in theGroup of obligors and to maintaining a certain level of interest cover at the Group level, the loan is not secured directly against any property allowing operational flexibility.
The Group has operated well within its covenants during 2016 and as at 30 September 2016 seeNote 2 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions.
The Group ensures that it maintains sufficient cash for operational requirements at all times.
The Group also ensures that it has sufficient undrawn committed borrowing facilities from a diverse range of banks and other sources to allow for operational flexibility and to meet committed expenditure.
The business is highly cash generative from its sales of vacant properties, gross rents and management fees.
In adverse trading conditions, tenanted sales can be increased and new acquisitions can be stopped.
Consequently, the Group is able to reduce gearing levels and improve liquidity quickly.
The following table analyses the Groups financial liabilities and net-settled derivative financial liabilities at the statement of financial position date into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed inthe table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
As the amounts included in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, these amounts will not equal the amounts disclosed on the statement of financial position for borrowings, derivative financial instruments, trade and other payables and provisions for liabilities and charges.
Areconciliation to the statement of financial position amounts is given below for borrowings only.
Trade and other payables due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact ofdiscounting is not significant.
The cash flows are calculated using yield curves for floating rate interestbearing liabilities.
Foreign currency related cash flows are calculated by means of the forward rates relevant to each maturity date.

Maturity of committed undrawn borrowing facilities 2016 2015 m m Expiring: Between one and two years Between two and five years 277.9 96.7 More than five years 277.9 96.7 Market risk The Group is exposed to market risk through interest rates, foreign exchange fluctuations, the availability of credit and house price movements relating to the Tricomm Housing portfolio and the CHARM portfolio.
The Group internally measures its market risk exposure by running various sensitivity analyses.
The Directors consider that a 1 percent 2015: 1 percent movement in interest rates, a 10 percentage point 2015: 10 percentage point movement in Sterling and a 1 percentage point 2015: 1 percentage point movement in house prices represents a reasonable possible change.
The approach the Group takes to each of these risks is set out below.
The Group isnot significantly exposed to equity price risk or to commodity pricerisk.
Fair values IFRS 13 sets out a three-tier hierarchy for financial assets and liabilities valued at fair value.
These are as follows: Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 i nputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3 unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The fair value of swaps and other financial instruments is derived from the present value of future cash flows discounted at rates obtained by means of the current yield curve appropriate for those instruments.
As all significant inputs required to value the swaps are observable, they all fall within Level 2.
The CHARM portfolio falls within Level 3, inputs not based on observable market data.
The significant unobservable inputs affecting the carrying value are house price inflation and the discount rate.
Further details regarding the basis of valuation andthe sensitivity to changes in the key valuation assumptions are documented in Note 2, Critical accounting estimates and assumptions.
Note 21 provides areconciliation of movements and amounts recognised in the income statement and other comprehensive income.
142 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements Investment property falls within Level 3.
The Investment valuations provided by Allsop LLP and CBRE Limited are based on RICs Professional Valuation Standards, but include a number of unobservable inputs and other valuation assumptions.
In prior years, investment property has been included within Level 2.
However, as all inputs to their valuation on a property by property basis are not always observable, investment property is better shown within Level 3 and a transfer has been made in the current year to reflect this.
Further details of these assumptions and significant unobservable inputs are documented in Note 2, Critical accounting estimates and assumptions.
The reconciliation between opening and closing balances for Level 3 is detailed in the table below.
2016 2015 Assets Level 3 m m Opening balance 205.2 203.6 Amounts taken to income statement 26.1 11.6 Transfer from Level 2 246.3 Other movements 123.2 10.0 Closing balance 354.4 205.2 The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.

As trading property is only shown at market value within the Groups non-GAAP EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV measures it has been excluded from the fair value hierarchy table above.
If the market value of trading property were included it would fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined by IFRS 13.
The statutory book value of trading property is 904.3m and its market value is 649.4m higher at 1,553.7m.
The Groups fixed rate loans are included in the consolidated statement of financial position at amortised cost.
As the fixed rate loans are only shown at fair value in the Groups non-GAAP EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV measures they have been excluded from the fair value hierarchy table above.
Had they been included they would fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in IFRS13.
The statutory book value of fixed rate loans is 275m and their fair value is 301.8m.
Interest rate swaps and caps are all classified as either current assets or current liabilities.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap and cap contracts as at 30 September 2016 was 462.2m 2015:493.1m.
All of the financial derivatives included in the above table were valued by external consultants, J C Rathbone Associates Limited, using adiscounted cash flow model and market information and were checked internally using a software package.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 143 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued In accordance with IAS 39, the Group has reviewed its interest rate hedges.
In the absence of hedge accounting, movements infair value are taken directly to the income statement.
However, where cash flow hedges have been viewed as being effective, and have been designated as such, any gains or losses have been taken to other comprehensive income through the cash flow hedge reserve.
As at 30 September 2016 the Groups only fixed rate debt was the 275m quoted corporate bond due December 2020, whichhas been valued using quoted market prices, consistent with the approach as at 30 September 2015.
JC Rathbone Associates Limited has valued the Groups fixed rate debt on a replacement basis, taking into account the difference between the fixed rates for the Groups borrowings and the market value and prevailing interest rates of appropriate debt instruments, as a fair value adjustment.
The fair values compared to the carrying amounts of the Groups fixed rate financial liabilities are analysed below: Book value Fair value m m Fixed rate loan facilities 30 September 2016 275.0 301.8 Fixed rate loan facilities 30 September 2015 464.8 497.1 Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from the risk of fluctuations in interest charges on floating rate borrowings.
The Group mitigates this risk through the use of variable to fixed interest rate swaps and caps.
This subjects the Group to fair value risk as the value of the financial derivatives fluctuates in line with variations in interest rates.
However, the Group seeks to cash flow hedge account where applicable.
The Group is, however, driven by commercial considerations when hedging its interest rate risk and is not driven by the strict requirements of the hedge accounting rules under IAS 39 if this is to the detriment of achieving the best commercial arrangement.
Hedging activities are carried out under the terms of the Groups hedging policies and are regularly reviewed by the Board to ensure compliance with this policy.
The Board reviews its policy on interest rate exposure regularly with a view to establishing that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment.
The current Group treasury policy is to maintain floating-rate exposure of no greater than 30% of expected borrowing.
As at 30 September 2016, 87% 2015: 77% of the Groups net borrowings were economically hedged to fixed or capped rates.
Based on the Groups interest rate profile at the statement of financial position date, a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease annual profits by 1.8m 2015: an increase of 7.4m.
Similarly, a 1% decrease would increase annual profits by 1.8m 2015: a decrease of 7.4m.
Based on the Groups interest rate profile at the statement of financial position date, a 1% increase in interest rates would increase the Groups equity by 14.5m 2015: 15.6m.
Similarly, a 1% decrease would decrease the Groups equity by 14.5m 2015:15.6m.
Upward movements in mediumand long-term interest rates, associated with higher interest rate expectation, increase the value of the Groups interest rate swaps that provide protection against such moves.
The converse is true for downward movements in the interest yield curve.
Where the Groups swaps qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39, these movements infair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement.
144 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements As at 30 September 2016, the market value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39, is a net liability of 13.1m 2015: 5.0m.
The total ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges recognised within the income statement totals a gain of nil 2015: 0.4m.
The fair value movement on derivatives not in hedge accounting relationships and amounts reclassified fromequity to the income statement amounted, in aggregate, to a charge of 9.9m 2015 charge restated: 6.3m in the income statement analysed as follows: 2015 restated 2016 Note 3 m m Fair value movement on derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges 9.9 6.7 Amounts reclassified from equity to the income statement 0.4 9.9 6.3 At 30 September 2016, the market value of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39, is a net asset of0.3m 2015:a liability of 28.5m.

Foreign exchange risk The Groups foreign exchange risk arises from the exposure due to translating overseas trading performance and overseas net assets into Sterling.
The Group does not have foreign currency trading with cross border currency flows.
The Group hedges foreign currency assets naturally by funding them through borrowings in the applicable foreign currency and aims to ensure that it has no material unhedged net assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency.
Profit translation is not hedged.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 145 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued The Groups statement of financial position translation exposure is summarised below: 2016 2015 Euro Euro m m Gross foreign currency assets 11.4 89.2 Gross foreign currency liabilities 12.1 83.3 Net exposure 0.7 5.9 As at 30 September 2016, it is estimated that a general increase decrease of 10 percentage points in the value of Sterling against the Euro would decrease increase the Groups profit before tax by approximately 0.4m 2015: 0.2m and equity by Nil 2015: 0.5m.
Credit availability risk Credit availability risk relates to the Groups ability to refinance its borrowings at the end of their terms or to secure additional financing where necessary.
The Group maintains relationships with a range of lenders and maintains sufficient headroom through cash and committed borrowings.
As at 30 September 2016, the Group had available headroom of 321m.
The 100m loan from M&G Investments Management Limited was repaid on 6 October 2016.
There are no other material maturities of committed borrowings until 2020.
House price risk The cash flows arising from the Groups financial interest in property assets CHARM and the Tricomm Housing portfolio are related to the movement in value of the underlying property assets and, therefore, are subject to movements in house prices.
However, consistent with the Groups approach to house price risk across its portfolio of trading and investment properties, theGroup does not seek to eliminate this risk as it is a fundamental part of the Groups business model.
Capital risk management The Board manages the Groups capital through the regular review of: cash flow projections, the ability of the Group to meetcontractual commitments, covenant tests, dividend cover and gearing.
The current capital structure of the Group comprises amix of debt and equity.
Debt is both current and non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings as set out inthe consolidated statement of financial position.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as setoutinthe consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Group loans and borrowings have associated covenant requirements with respect to loan to value and interest cover ratios.
TheBoard regularly reviews all current and projected future levels to monitor anticipated compliance and available headroom against key thresholds.
Loan to value is reviewed in the context of the Boards view of markets, the prospects of, and risks relating to, the portfolio and the recurring cash flows of the business.
The Group is now operating within a range of gearing of35%45%, which it considers to be appropriate in the medium term.
The Group monitors its cost of debt and weighted average cost of capital WACC on a regular basis.

ii Defined benefit pension scheme The Group currently contributes to a defined benefit pension scheme that was closed to new members and employee contributions in 2003.
The full deficit in the scheme was recognised in the statement of financial position as at 1 October 2004.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every three years.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each statement of financial position date by a qualified actuary, also under the Projected Unit Credit Method, for the purpose of determining the amounts to be reflected in the Groups financial statements under IAS 19.
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the statement of financial position date less the fair value of scheme assets.
The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit outgoings allowing for future salary increases for active members, revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members and then discounting to the statement of financial position date.
There are no current or past service costs as the scheme is closed to new members and employee contributions.
The net interest amount, calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability, is reflected in the income statement each year.
Actuarial gains and losses net of deferred income tax are reflected in other comprehensive income each year.
Defined contribution scheme The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for its employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Pension arrangements for Directors are disclosed in the report of the Remuneration Committee andthe Directors Remuneration report on pages 62 to 85.
The pension cost charge in these financial statements represents contributions payable by the Group.
The charge of 1.0m 2015:1.0m is included within employee remuneration in Note 11.
Defined benefit scheme In addition to the above, the Group also operates a final salary defined benefit pension scheme, the BPT Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately in funds administered by Trustees and are invested with Rathbones Investment Management Limited, an independent investment manager.
Pension benefits are linked to the members final pensionable salaries and service at their retirement date or date of leaving if earlier.
The Trustees are responsible for running thescheme in accordance with the schemes trust deed and rules, which sets out their powers.
The Trustees of the scheme arerequired to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the scheme.
There is a requirement that at least one-third of the Trustees are nominated by the members of the scheme.
There are three categories of pension scheme members: Active members: currently employed by the Group.
Note no benefits have accrued since 30 June 2003, although active members retain a final salary link: Deferred members: former employees of the Group: and Pensioner members: in receipt of pension.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 147 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 29 Pension costs continued The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit payments allowing for future salary increases foractive members, revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members and then discounting to the statement of financial position date.
In the period up to retirement, benefits receive increases linked to CPI inflation subject to acap of no more than 5% p. a.. After retirement, benefits receive fixed increases of 5% p. a.
The valuation method used is known as theProjected Unit Method.
The approximate overall duration of the schemes defined benefit obligation as at 30 September 2016 was 17years.
The IAS 19 calculations for disclosure purposes have been based upon the results of the actuarial valuation carried out as at 1July 2013, updated to 30 September 2016, by a qualified independent actuary.

These assets are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, but provide volatility and risk in the short term.
Changes in bond yields: a decrease in corporate bond yields would increase the schemes defined benefit obligation: however, this would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings.
Inflation risk: some of the schemes defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore higher inflation will result in a higher defined benefit obligation subject to the appropriate caps in place.
The majority of the schemes assets are either unaffected by inflation, or only loosely correlated with inflation, therefore an increase in inflation would also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy: if scheme members live longer than expected, the schemes benefits will need to be paid for longer, increasing the schemes defined benefit obligation.
148 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements The Trustees and Group manage risks in the scheme through the following strategies: Diversification: investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
Investment strategy: the Trustees are required to review their investment strategy on a regular basis.

Future funding obligation The Trustees are required to carry out an actuarial valuation every three years.
The last actuarial valuation of the scheme was performed by the Actuary for the Trustees as at 1 July 2013.
This valuation revealed a funding shortfall of 4.4m.
As a result ofthis valuation, the Group agreed a recovery plan with the Trustees to pay additional contributions to eliminate the deficit by31 January 2020.
Based on this plan, the Company expects to pay 0.6m p. a. to the scheme, until 31 January 2020.
A full actuarial valuation is currently in progress based on the scheme assets and liabilities as at 1 July 2016.
The Group and the Trustees will review the results of the valuation on completion.
In line with paragraph 23 of IFRIC 14, no additional liability is recognised as the additional contributions under the funding plan will reduce the future contributions payable into the Scheme.
Sensitivity analysis Set out below is an analysis of how the scheme deficit would vary with changes to the key actuarial assumptions: Discount rate movement of 0.1% p. a.
Increase decrease in deficit of 0.6m RPI Inflation movement of 0.1% p. a.

Thefair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of shares and options is recognised as an employee expense.
The total amount tobeexpensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares andoptions granted.
For market-based conditions, the probability of vesting is taken into account in the fair value calculation and no revision is made to the number of shares or options expected to vest.
For non-market conditions, each year the Group revises its estimate of the number of options or shares that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Awards that are subject to a market-based performance condition are valued at fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation model.
Awardsnot subject to a market-based performance condition are valued at fair value using the Black Scholes valuationmodel.
When options are exercised the proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 151 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 30 Issued share capital continued Acquisition of and investment in own shares The Group acquires its own shares to enable it to meet its obligations under the various share schemes in operation.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Companys own shares.
The acquisition cost of the shares isdebited to an investment in own shares reserve within retained earnings.
Where the Group buys back its own shares as treasury shares it adopts the accounting as described above.
Where it subsequently cancels them, issued share capital is reduced by the nominal value of the shares cancelled and this same amount is transferred to the capital redemption reserve.
The Company operates a SAYE share option scheme available to employees.
The number of shares subject to options as at 30September 2016, the periods in which they were granted and the periods in which they may be exercised, are given below.

152 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements For the LTIP awards, one-half are subject to an absolute total shareholder return performance condition measured over three years from the date of grant and one-half are subject to annual growth in NNNAV compared to the average growth in the Halifax and Nationwide House Price indices all measured over three years from the date of grant.
Awards granted under the DBP have no specific performance conditions other than the Company meeting its target for operating profit before valuation movements and non-recurring items OPBVM and employees in the scheme continuing tobe employed.
There is a three-year vesting period from the date of grant.
One-third of the awards vest at the end of each year.
Participants can choose to exercise their awards on vesting or to retain their awards within the plan until the end of thethird year at which point a 50% matching element is added totheir award entitlement.
In addition to thenormal DBP scheme, an enhanced DBP scheme EDBP is also provided.
Theenhanced scheme operates in exactly the same way as the normal DBP scheme except that if participants retain their awards within the plan until the end of the fifth year, a further additional 50% matching award is added to their award entitlement.
Awards under the DBP EDBP have been valued based on the share price at the date of the award less the dividend yield at the award date as there is no entitlement to dividends during the vesting period.
Awards under the SAYE scheme have been valued at fair value using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
Awards under the SIP scheme have been based on the share price at the date of the award.

156 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements 36 Operating leases Accounting Policy i Group as lessor The net present value of ground rents receivable is, in the opinion of the Directors, immaterial.
Accordingly, ground rents receivable are taken to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Properties leased out to tenants are included in the statement of financial position as either investment property or as trading property under inventories.
ii Group as lessee The Group occupies a number of its offices as a lessee.
After a review of all of its occupational leases, the Directors have concluded that all such leases are operating leases.
Payments, including prepayments, made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments payable by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Operating lease payments due: Not later than one year 0.8 1.1 Later than one year and not later than five years 3.7 4.3 Later than five years 1.1 1.9 5.6 7.3 Operating lease payments represent the lease payments made in the year relating to renting of office space used by the Group, car leases under contract hire arrangements and operating lease payments relating to office equipment such as photocopiers.
Leases relating to office space used by the Group have initial terms of varying lengths, between one and ten years.
Rent reviews generally take place every five years.
Contract hire car leases generally have a three-year term.
There are no other significant operating lease arrangements requiring disclosure under IAS 17.
There are no contingent rents recognised within net rental income in 2016 or 2015 relating to properties where the Group acts as a lessor of assets under operating leases.
A significant proportion of the Groups non-cancellable operating leases relate to Regulated Tenancies under which tenants have the right to remain in a property for the remainder of their lives.
It is therefore not possible to estimate the timing of future minimum lease payments.
Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 157 Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 37 Contingent liabilities The properties in certain subsidiary companies forming a guarantee Group with a market value of 1,181.1m provide the security for the Groups core debt facility.
Barclays Bank plc and Lloyds Bank plc have provided guarantees under performance bonds relating to the Groups UK Development division.
As at 30 September 2016, total guarantees amounted to 2.3m 2015: 2.8m.
The Group has an obligation, under an agreement for sale in relation to its land at West Waterlooville, to pay further consideration should the site value exceed certain pre-agreed amounts.
It also has an obligation under a profit sharing agreement to share profits above an agreed threshold.
It is not possible to determine the amount or timing of any such future payments due to the long-term nature of the sites development and the associated uncertainties.
However, our current best estimate is that the earliest payment under these arrangements will not be before October November 2017 and any payments are likely to be spread over a number of years.
As explained in more detail in Note 20, there is uncertainty relating to the future of the site at Curzon Park in which the Group has a 50% joint venture interest.
Should the value of the site, together with any compensation received, be insufficient to recover the carrying value of our investment, the Group may incur further charges in excess of those provided in these financial statements, in respect of obligations to the joint venture.
38 Capital commitments 2016 2015 m m 117.1 63.1 The Group has current commitments under a number of its PRS projects totalling 117.1m as at 30 September 2016 2015:63.1m.
39 Post balance sheet events An irrevocable prepayment notice was delivered to M&G Investments Management Limited on the 29 September 2016, setting out the early repayment terms of the 100m term loan due 2021.
The loan was subsequently repaid in full on 6 October 2016 utilising headroom on the Groups Core Facilities.
On 28 November 2016, the Group agreed and signed two new 50m bi-lateral term loans with HSBC and RBS.
The initial term ofeach loan is 5 years.
The HSBC facility agreement has an option to extend the maturity for a further one year.
On 28 November 2016, the Group agreed to aquire a PRS, build-to-rent development at Finzels Reach in Bristol for 45.7m.
The site will deliver 194 private rental homes and is expected to complete at the beginning of 2019.
