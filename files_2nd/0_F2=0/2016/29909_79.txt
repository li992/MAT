Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 30 Business combinations During the year, the Group obtained sole control of three separate property partnerships, previously accounted for as joint ventures, through acquisition of the other partners 50% interests in each of the partnerships.
The acquisitions increased the Groups owned property portfolio by 1,714m, comprising 70 stores and 2 distribution centres, reduced the Groups undiscounted lease commitments by 852m discounted 563m and increased borrowings and derivative liabilities by 1,545m.
On 20 March 2015 the Group received British Land Co PLCs British Land share of the Tesco Aqua Limited partnership Aqua and cash of 96m in exchange for British Land taking sole ownership of three shopping centres, three retail parks and three standalone stores which were previously held in two joint ventures between the two companies.
Further information received after the interim results August 2015 and within the measurement period resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax liability of 18m and associated goodwill of 22m, together with re-allocation of cash flows within investment activities to better reflect the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
The net profit of 28m on these transactions comprises a loss on acquisition of Aqua of 175m offset by a profit of 203m.
The profit arises largely on the sale of the Groups shares in the two joint ventures together with releases of related deferred income balances.
On 25 February 2016, the Group obtained sole control of the Tesco Red Limited Partnership Red and Tesco Property Limited Partnership TPLP from British Airways Pension Fund and Phoenix Life Assurance Limited respectively, realising a net loss of 53m on acquisition.
The Group additionally released previously recognised impairments, onerous leases and deferred income balances relating to these entities totalling 84m, resulting in a net profit of 31m from the two transactions.
The overall profit of 59m from these transactions has been classified as an exceptional item in Property transactions included within Profits losses arising on property-related items.
The profit includes a 14m gain on remeasuring the Groups 50% interest in the three joint ventures immediately prior to the acquisition to a fair value asset of 24m.
Across the three transactions, goodwill balances totalling 41m have been recognised on recognition of deferred tax liability balances on land, due to the Group controlling the reversal of a portion of these tax liabilities, and not expecting them to be realised.
This goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
The table below sets out the provisional values to the Group in respect of these acquisitions.

Note 31 Commitments and contingencies Capital commitments At 27 February 2016, there were commitments for capital expenditure contracted for, but not provided for, of 215m 2015: 182m, principally relating to 151m store buy-back commitments of seven stores.
Contingent liabilities There are a number of contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business which if realised are not expected to result in a material liability to the Group.
The Group recognises provisions for liabilities when it is more likely than not that a settlement will be required and the value of such a payment can be reliably estimated.
On 22 September 2014, the Group announced that it had identified an overstatement of its expected profit for the first half of the year, as contained in guidance it had issued in August 2014, relating to the recognition of commercial income and the deferral of costs.
The Serious Fraud Office SFO commenced an investigation into accounting practices at the Group on 29 October 2014.
It is not possible to predict the timescale or outcome of the SFO investigation, but the SFO could decide to prosecute individuals and the Group, and there is the possibility of fines and or other consequences.
The Group is cooperating with the SFO.
In November 2015 the Group reached agreement in principle to settle a class action by US investors who dealt through the American Depository Receipts ADRs programme which represented approximately 2.3% of issued share capital.
This consisted of a settlement of US$12 million with no admission of liability.
The Group is also facing a claim in Ohio by the remaining holders of ADRs, which is equivalent to 0.16% of the total issued ordinary shares of the Group.
The Group is defending this claim.
In addition, law firms in the UK have announced the intention of forming claimant groups to commence litigation against the Group for matters arising out of or in connection with its overstatement, and purport to have secured third party funding for such litigation.
No such litigation has yet been formally threatened or commenced and the Group is consequently unable to make any assessment of the likely outcome or quantum.
