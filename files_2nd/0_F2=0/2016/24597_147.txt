Reinsurance assets and insurance contract liabilities continued All insurance contracts are annual policies and as such the unearned premiums reserve is released within 12 months from the reporting date.
Movement in liabilities comprises changes in outstanding claims liabilities relating to claim events in previous periods and the expected cost of current year claims.
The expected timing of the settlements for the net and gross claims liabilities are shown in Note 26.
Claims development The following table shows the development of the originally estimated gross ultimate claims liabilities relative to the current estimates of gross ultimate claims liabilities, both net of salvage and subrogation recoveries.
Claims development refers to the financial adjustment in the current accounting period relating to claims incurred in previous accounting periods because of new and more up to date information that has become available and to reflect changes in inflation.
The development is presented for each of the most recent six accident periods and all historic periods prior to these from incorporation of the Groups underwriter in 2002 i. e. including accident periods prior to the creation of the Group, as estimated at each reporting date.
The development for the years ended 31 December 2015 and earlier has been restated to include the effect of rebates receivable on the net claim cost to align to Solvency II disclosures.
The table also shows a reconciliation of the gross outstanding claims liabilities, net of salvage and subrogation recoveries, to the gross outstanding claims liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2016.
The information is presented on an accident period basis.
The fair value acquisition adjustment relates to business combination accounting as a result of the Goldman Sachs investment described in Note 12.
The reduction in the Ogden rate has had a 160.1m impact on gross claims liabilities and a 13.4m impact on net claims liabilities at the end of the current year.
