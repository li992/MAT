Dividend resources The Companys policy is to increase the dividend in line with the underlying performance of the business, measured with reference to the cash and underlying cash result.
The capacity of the Company to make dividend payments to shareholders is determined by the availability of distributable reserves and cash resources.
Distributable reserves The Company is a non-trading investment holding Company which derives its distributable reserves from dividends paid by its subsidiaries.
The primary subsidiary which pays dividends to the Company is St. Jamess Place Wealth Management Group plc, an intermediate holding Company which in turn receives dividends primarily from St. Jamess Place UK plc, St. Jamess Place Unit Trust Group Limited and St. Jamess Place Investment Administration Limited.
Ongoing solvency requirements within the life assurance, unit trust and financial services companies of the Group limit their ability to distribute all their distributable reserves.
Analysis of solvency requirements is included in the Solvency section of the Financial Review on page 43 and further information about regulation and capital requirements is included in Note 18 on page 168.
The Directors review the distributable reserves of the Company ahead of each interim and final dividend being proposed to ensure the Company has sufficient distributable reserves to allow a lawful dividend to be paid.
As at 31 December 2016, the total distributable reserves of the Company were 294.6 million 2015: 249.8 million.
The Directors are satisfied that this is sufficient to support the proposed dividend of 109 million.
