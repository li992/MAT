185 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financialstatements NOTE 1: BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements of Lloyds BankingGroupplc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
IFRS comprises accounting standards prefixed IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and those prefixed IAS issued by the IASBs predecessor body as well as interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRSIC and its predecessor body.
The EU endorsed version of IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement relaxes some of the hedge accounting requirements: the Group has not taken advantage of this relaxation, and therefore there is no difference in application to the Group between IFRS as adopted by the EU and IFRS as issued by the IASB.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment properties, availableforsale financial assets, trading securities and certain other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and all derivative contracts.
As stated on page 82, the directors consider that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financialstatements.
During the year the Group has reviewed its holding of government securities classified as heldtomaturity in light of the current low interest rate environment and they have been reclassified as availableforsale: this has resulted in a credit of 1,544 million to the availableforsale revaluation reserve 1,127 million after tax.
Details of those IFRS pronouncements which will be relevant to the Group but which were not effective at 31December 2016 and which have not been applied in preparing these financial statements are given in note 55.
NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Groups accounting policies are set out below.
These accounting policies have been applied consistently.
A Consolidation The assets, liabilities and results of Group undertakings including structured entities are included in the financial statements on the basis of accounts made up to the reporting date.
Group undertakings include subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
Details of the Groups subsidiaries and related undertakings are given on pages 293 to 300.
1 Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it has power over the entity, is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and has the ability to affect those returns through the exercise of its power.
This generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights although in certain circumstances a holding of less than one half of the voting rights may still result in the ability of the Group to exercise control.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to any of the above elements.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group: they are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group consolidates collective investment vehicles if its beneficial ownership interests give it substantive rights to remove the external fund manager over the investment activities of the fund.
Where a subsidiary of the Group is the fund manager of a collective investment vehicle, the Group considers a number of factors in determining whether it acts as principal, and therefore controls the collective investment vehicle, including: an assessment of the scope of the Groups decision making authority over the investment vehicle: the rights held by other parties including substantive removal rights without cause over the Group acting as fund manager: the remuneration to which the Group is entitled in its capacity as decision maker: and the Groups exposure to variable returns from the beneficial interest it holds in the investment vehicle.
Consolidation may be appropriate in circumstances where the Group has less than a majority beneficial interest.
Where a collective investment vehicle is consolidated the interests of parties other than the Group are reported in other liabilities and the movement in these interests in interest expense.
Structured entities are entities that are designed so that their activities are not governed by way of voting rights.
In assessing whether the Group has power over such entities in which it has an interest, the Group considers factors such as the purpose and design of the entity: its practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity: the nature of the relationship with the entity: and the size of its exposure to the variability of returns of theentity.
The treatment of transactions with noncontrolling interests depends on whether, as a result of the transaction, the Group loses control of the subsidiary.
Changes in the parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions: any difference between the amount by which the noncontrolling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent entity.
Where the Group loses control of the subsidiary, at the date when control is lost the amount of any noncontrolling interest in that former subsidiary is derecognised and any investment retained in the former subsidiary is remeasured to its fair value: the gain or loss that is recognised in profit or loss on the partial disposal of the subsidiary includes the gain or loss on the remeasurement of the retainedinterest.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group.
The consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred except those relating to the issuance of debt instruments see E 5 below or share capital see P below.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date.
2 Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are joint arrangements over which the Group has joint control with other parties and has rights to the net assets of the arrangements.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity, but is not control or joint control of those policies, and is generally achieved through holding between 20 percent and 50percent of the voting share capital of the entity.
The Group utilises the venture capital exemption for investments where significant influence or joint control is present and the business unit operates as a venture capital business.
These investments are designated at initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
Otherwise, the Groups investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting.
186 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued B Goodwill Goodwill arises on business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Where the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity is greater than the cost of acquisition, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and is tested at least annually for impairment.
If an impairment is identified the carrying value of the goodwill is written down immediately through the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
At the date of disposal of a subsidiary, the carrying value of attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
C Other intangible assets Intangible assets which have been determined to have a finite useful life are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life as follows: up to 7 years for capitalised software: 10 to 15 years for brands and other intangibles.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date to assess whether there is any indication that they are impaired.
If any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is determined and in the event that the assets carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount, it is written down immediately.
Certain brands have been determined to have an indefinite useful life and are not amortised.
Such intangible assets are reassessed annually to reconfirm that an indefinite useful life remains appropriate.
In the event that an indefinite life is inappropriate a finite life is determined and an impairment review is performed on the asset.
D Revenue recognition Interest income and expense are recognised in the income statement for all interest-bearing financial instruments using the effective interest method, except for those classified at fair value through profit or loss.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the expected life of the financial instrument.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, ashorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability, including early redemption fees, and related penalties: and premiums and discounts that are an integral part of the overall return.
Direct incremental transaction costs related to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial instrument are also taken into account.
Fees and commissions which are not an integral part of the effective interest rate are generally recognised when the service has been provided.
Loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down are deferred together with related direct costs and recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest rate on the loan once drawn.
Where it is unlikely that loan commitments will be drawn, loan commitment fees are recognised over the life of the facility.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Revenue recognition policies specific to life insurance and general insurance business are detailed below see M below : those relating to leases are set out in J 2 below.
E Financial assets and liabilities On initial recognition, financial assets are classified into fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets, held-to-maturity investments or loans and receivables.
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for trading liabilities and other financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition which are held at fair value.
The Group initially recognises loans and receivables, deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Regular way purchases and sales of securities and other financial assets and trading liabilities are recognised on trade date, being the date that the Group is committed to purchase or sell an asset.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to receive cash flows from those assets has expired or when the Group has transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets and either: substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred: or the Group has neither retained nor transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards, but has transferred control.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished ie when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expire.
1 Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss Financial instruments are classified at fair value through profit or loss where they are trading securities or where they are designated at fair value through profit or loss by management.
Derivatives are carried at fair value see F below.
Held for trading: Trading securities are debt securities and equity shares acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or which are part of a portfolio which is managed for short-term gains.
Such securities are classified as trading securities and recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value together with interest coupons and dividend income are recognised in the income statement within net trading income in the period in which they occur.
Classified at fair value through profit and loss: Other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such by management upon initial recognition.
Such assets and liabilities are carried in the balance sheet at their fair value and gains and losses arising from changes in fair value together with interest coupons and dividend income are recognised in the income statement within net trading income in the period in which they occur.
Financial assets and liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss on acquisition in the following circumstances: it eliminates or significantly reduces the inconsistent treatment that would otherwise arise from measuring the assets and liabilities or recognising gains or losses on different bases.
The main type of financial assets designated by the Group at fair value through profit or loss are assets backing insurance contracts and investment contracts issued by the Groups life insurance businesses.
Fair value designation allows changes in the fair value of these assets to be recorded in the income statement along with the changes in the value of the associated liabilities, thereby significantly reducing the measurement inconsistency had the assets been classified as available-for-sale financial assets.
the assets and liabilities are part of a group which is managed, and its performance evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, with management information also prepared on this basis.
where the assets and liabilities contain one or more embedded derivatives that significantly modify the cash flows arising under the contract and would otherwise need to be separately accounted for.
187 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued The fair values of assets and liabilities traded in active markets are based on current bid and offer prices respectively.
If the market is not active the Group establishes a fair value by using valuation techniques.
Refer to note49 3 Financial instruments: Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value for details of valuation techniques and significant inputs to valuation models.
2 Available-for-sale financial assets Debt securities and equity shares that are not classified as trading securities, at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments or as loans and receivables areclassified as available-for-sale financial assets and are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value, inclusive of transaction costs.
Such assets are intended to be held for an indeterminate period of time and may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale arerecognised directly in other comprehensive income, until the financial asset is either sold, becomes impaired or matures, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement.
Interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on debt securities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the incomestatement.
The Group is permitted to transfer a financial asset from the available-for-sale category to the loans and receivables category where that asset would otherwise have met the definition of loans and receivables at the time of reclassification and where there is both the intention and ability to hold that financial asset for the foreseeable future.
Reclassification of a financial asset from the available-for-sale category to the held-to-maturity category is permitted when the Group has the ability and intent to hold that financial asset tomaturity.
Reclassifications are made at fair value as of the reclassification date.
Fair value becomes the new cost or amortised cost as applicable.
Effective interest rates for financial assets reclassified to the loans and receivables and held-to-maturity categories are determined at the reclassification date.
Any previous gain or loss on a transferred asset that has been recognised in equity is amortised to profit or loss over the remaining life of the investment using the effective interest method or until the asset becomes impaired.
Any difference between the new amortised cost and the expected cash flows is also amortised over the remaining life of the asset using the effective interestmethod.
When an impairment loss is recognised in respect of available-for-sale assets transferred, the unamortised balance of any available-for-sale reserve that remains in equity is transferred to the income statement and recorded as part of the impairmentloss.
3 Loans and receivables Loans and receivables include loans and advances to banks and customers and eligible assets including those transferred into this category out of the fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale financial assets categories.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised when cash is advanced to the borrowers at fair value inclusive of transaction costs or, for eligible assets transferred into this category, their fair value at the date of transfer.
Financial assets classified as loans and receivables are accounted for at amortised cost using the effective interest method see D above less provision for impairment see H below.
The Group has entered into securitisation and similar transactions to finance certain loans and advances to customers.
In cases where the securitisation vehicles are funded by the issue of debt, on terms whereby the majority of the risks and rewards of the portfolio of securitised lending are retained by the Group, these loans and advances continue to be recognised by the Group, together with a corresponding liability forthe funding.
4 Held-to-maturity investments Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Groups management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity other than: those that the Group designates upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss: those that the Group designates as available-for-sale: and those that meet the definition of loans and receivables.
These are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs and measured subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment.
A sale or reclassification of a more than insignificant amount of held-to-maturity investments would result in the reclassification of all held-to-maturity investments to available-for-sale financial assets.
5 Borrowings Borrowings which include deposits from banks, customer deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred.
These instruments are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Preference shares and other instruments which carry a mandatory coupon or are redeemable on a specific date are classified as financial liabilities.
The coupon on these instruments is recognised in the income statement as interest expense.
Securities which carry a discretionary coupon and have no fixed maturity or redemption date are classified as other equity instruments.
Interest payments on these securities are recognised, net of tax, as distributions from equity in the period in which they are paid.
An exchange of financial liabilities on substantially different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability is recognised in profit or loss together with any related costs or fees incurred.
When a financial liability is exchanged for an equity instrument, the new equity instrument is recognised at fair value and any difference between the original carrying value of the liability and the fair value of the new equity is recognised in the profit or loss.
6 Sale and repurchase agreements including securities lending and borrowing Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements repos continue to be recognised on the balance sheet where substantially all of the risks and rewards are retained.
Funds received under these arrangements are included in deposits from banks, customer deposits, or trading liabilities.
Conversely, securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repos, where the Group does not acquire substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership, are recorded as loans and receivables or trading securities.
The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method.
Securities borrowing and lending transactions are typically secured: collateral takes the form of securities or cash advanced or received.
Securities lent to counterparties are retained on the balance sheet.
Securities borrowed are not recognised on the balance sheet, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability.
Cash collateral given or received is treated as a loan and receivable or customer deposit.
188 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued F Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivatives are classified as trading except those designated as effective hedging instruments which meet the criteria under IAS39.
All derivatives are recognised at their fair value.
Derivatives are carried in the balance sheet as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
Refer to note49 3 Financial instruments: Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value fordetails of valuation techniques and significant inputs to valuation models.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that is not part of a hedging relationship are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in financial instruments and insurance contracts unless the embedded derivative is itself an insurance contract are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
In accordance with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, a policyholders option to surrender an insurance contract for a fixed amount isnot treated as an embedded derivative.
The method of recognising the movements in the fair value of derivatives depends on whether they are designated as hedging instruments and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Hedge accounting allows one financial instrument, generally a derivative such as a swap, to be designated as a hedge of another financial instrument such as a loan or deposit or a portfolio of such instruments.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, formal documentation is drawn up specifying the hedging strategy, the hedged item, the hedging instrument and the methodology that will be used to measure the effectiveness of the hedge relationship in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged risk.
The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is tested both at inception and throughout its life and if at any point it is concluded thatit is no longer highly effective in achieving its documented objective, hedge accounting is discontinued.
1 Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk: this also applies if the hedged asset is classified as an available-for-sale financial asset.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are no longer recognised in the income statement.
The cumulative adjustment that has been made tothe carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method over the period tomaturity.
2 Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
3 Net investment hedges Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income, the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
The hedging instrument used in net investment hedges may include non-derivative liabilities as well as derivativefinancial instruments.
G Offset Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right of set-off and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Cash collateral on exchange traded derivative transactions is presented gross unless the collateral cash flows are always settled net with the derivative cash flows.
In certain situations, even though master netting agreements exist, the lack of management intention to settle on a net basis results in the financial assets and liabilities being reported gross on the balance sheet.
H Impairment of financial assets 1 Assets accounted for at amortised cost At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether, as a result of one or more events occurring after initial recognition of the financial asset and prior to the balance sheet date, there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets has become impaired.
Where such an event, including the identification of fraud, has had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets, an impairment allowance is recognised.
The amount of impairment allowance is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
If the asset has a variable rate of interest, the discount rate usedfor measuring the impairment allowance is the current effective interest rate.
Subsequent to the recognition of an impairment loss on a financial asset or a group of financial assets, interest income continues to be recognised on an effective interest rate basis, on the assets carrying value net of impairment provisions.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the allowance is adjusted and the amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment allowances are assessed individually for financial assets that are individually significant.
Impairment allowances for portfolios of smaller balance homogenous loans such as most residential mortgages, personal loans and credit card balances that are below the individual assessment thresholds, and for loan losses that have been incurred but not separately identified at the balance sheet date, are determined on a collective basis.
In certain circumstances, the Group will renegotiate the original terms of a customers loan, either as part of an ongoing customer relationship or in response to adverse changes in the circumstances of the borrower.
Where the renegotiated payments of interest and principal will not recover the original carrying value of the asset, the asset continues to be reported as past due and is considered impaired.
Where the renegotiated payments of interest and principal will recover the original carrying value of the asset, the loan is no longer reported as past due or impaired provided that payments are made in accordance with the revised terms.
Renegotiation may lead to the loan and associated provision being derecognised and a new loan being recognised initially at fair value.
189 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued A loan or advance is normally written off, either partially or in full, against the related allowance when the proceeds from realising any available security have been received or there is no realistic prospect of recovery and the amount of the loss has been determined.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of impairment losses recorded in the income statement.
For both secured and unsecured retail balances, the write-off takes place only once an extensive set of collections processes has been completed, or the status of the account reaches a point where policy dictates that forbearance is no longer appropriate.
For commercial lending, a write-off occurs if the loan facility with the customer is restructured, the asset is under administration and the only monies that can be received are the amounts estimated by the administrator, the underlying assets are disposed and a decision is made that no further settlement monies will be received, or external evidence for example, third party valuations is available that there has been an irreversible decline in expected cash flows.
2 Available-for-sale financial assets The Group assesses, at each balance sheet date, whether there is objective evidence that an available-for-sale financial asset is impaired.
In addition to the criteria for financial assets accounted for at amortised cost set out above, this assessment involves reviewing the current financial circumstances including creditworthiness and future prospects of the issuer, assessing the future cash flows expected to be realised and, in the case of equity shares, considering whether there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the asset below its cost.
If an impairment loss has been incurred, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost net of any principal repayment and amortisation and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that asset previously recognised, is reclassified from equity to the income statement.
For impaired debt instruments, impairment losses are recognised in subsequent periods when it is determined that there has been a further negative impact on expected future cash flows: a reduction in fair value caused by general widening of credit spreads would not, of itself, result in additional impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, an amount not greater than the original impairment loss is credited to the income statement: any excess is taken to other comprehensive income.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement.
I Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment other than investment property is included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The value of land included in premises is not depreciated.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the difference between the cost andthe residual value over their estimated useful lives, as follows: the shorter of 50 years and the remaining period of the lease for freehold long and short leasehold premises: the shorter of 10 years and, if lease renewal is not likely, the remaining period of the lease for leasehold improvements: 10to20 years for fixtures and furnishings: and 2 to 8 years for other equipment and motor vehicles.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
In the event that an assets carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Investment property comprises freehold and long leasehold land and buildings that are held either to earn rental income or for capital accretion or both, primarily within the life insurance funds.
In accordance with the guidance published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, investment property is carried at fair value based on current prices for similar properties, adjusted for the specific characteristics of the property such as location or condition.
If this information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as discounted cash flow projections or recent prices in less active markets.
These valuations are reviewed at least annually by independent professionally qualified valuers.
Investment property being redeveloped for continuing use as investment property, or for which the market has become less active, continues to be valued at fair value.
J Leases 1 As lessee The leases entered into by the Group are primarily operating leases.
Operating lease rentals payable are charged to the income statement onastraight-line basis over the period of the lease.
When an operating lease is terminated before the end of the lease period, any payment made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised asanexpense in the period of termination.
2 As lessor Assets leased to customers are classified as finance leases if the lease agreements transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee but not necessarily legal title.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
When assets are subject to finance leases, the present value of the lease payments, together with any unguaranteed residual value, is recognised as a receivable, net of provisions, within loans and advances to banks and customers.
The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance lease income.
Finance lease income is recognised in interest income over the term of the lease using the net investment method before tax so as to give a constant rate of return on the net investment in the leases.
Unguaranteed residual values are reviewed regularly to identify any impairment.
Operating lease assets are included within tangible fixed assets at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which equates to the lives of the leases, after taking into account anticipated residual values.
Operating lease rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of thelease.
The Group evaluates non-lease arrangements such as outsourcing and similar contracts to determine if they contain a lease which is then accounted forseparately.
K Employee benefits Short-term employee benefits, such as salaries, paid absences, performance-based cash awards and social security costs are recognised over the period in which the employees provide the related services.
1 Pension Schemes The Group operates a number of post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees including both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
A defined benefit scheme is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan into which the Group pays fixed contributions: there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions.
190 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Scheme assets are included at their fair value and scheme liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method.
The defined benefit scheme liabilities are discounted using rates equivalent to the market yields at the balance sheet date on highquality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pensionliability.
The Groups income statement charge includes the current service cost of providing pension benefits, past service costs, net interest expense income, and plan administration costs that are not deducted from the return on plan assets.
Past service costs, which represents the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment, are recognised when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs.
Net interest expense income is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest expense income and net of the cost of managing the plan assets, and the effect of changes to the asset ceiling if applicable are reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are reflected immediately in retained profits and will not subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss.
The Groups balance sheet includes the net surplus or deficit, being the difference between the fair value of scheme assets and the discounted value of scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the schemes.
In assessing whether a surplus is recoverable, the Group considers its current right to obtain a refund or a reduction in future contributions and does not anticipate any future acts by other parties that could change the amount of the surplus that may ultimately be recovered.
The costs of the Groups defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
2 Share-based compensation The Group operates a number of equitysettled, sharebased compensation plans in respect of services received from certain of its employees.
The value of the employee services received in exchange for equity instruments granted under these plans is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the instruments, with a corresponding increase in equity.
This expense is determined by reference to the fair value of the number of equity instruments that are expected to vest.
The fair value of equity instruments granted is based on market prices, if available, at the date of grant.
In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the instruments at the date of grant is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique, such as a BlackScholes option pricing model or a Monte Carlo simulation.
The determination of fair values excludes the impact of any nonmarket vesting conditions, which are included in the assumptions used to estimate the number of options that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, this estimate is reassessed and if necessary revised.
Any revision of the original estimate is recognised in the income statement, together with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Cancellations by employees of contributions to the Groups Save As You Earn plans are treated as nonvesting conditions and the Group recognises, in the year of cancellation, the amount of the expense that would have otherwise been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period.
Modifications are assessed at the date of modification and any incremental charges are charged to the incomestatement.
L Taxation Current income tax which is payable on taxable profits is recognised as an expense in the period in which the profits arise.
The Group provides for potential tax liabilities that may arise on the basis of the amounts expected to be paid to tax authorities including open matters where Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC adopt a different interpretation and application of tax law.
Dependent on their complexity, provisions are based on managements interpretation of the relevant tax legislation, precedents and guidance as well as external tax advice.
The provision is the best estimate of the consideration expected to be required to settle the particular obligation taking into account managements judgement of the relevant risks and uncertainties.
For the Groups longterm insurance businesses, the tax charge is analysed between tax that is payable in respect of policyholders returns and tax that is payable on shareholders returns.
This allocation is based on an assessment of the rates of tax which will be applied to the returns under current UKtaxrules.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Income tax payable on profits is recognised as an expense in the period in which those profits arise.
The tax effects of losses available for carry forward are recognised as an asset when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.
Deferred and current tax related to gains and losses on the fair value remeasurement of availableforsale investments and cash flow hedges, where these gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income, is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Such tax is subsequently transferred to the income statement together with the gain or loss.
Deferred and current tax assets and liabilities are offset when they arise in the same tax reporting group and where there is both a legal right of offset and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
M Insurance The Group undertakes both life insurance and general insurance business.
Insurance and participating investment contracts are accounted for under IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, which permits with certain exceptions the continuation of accounting practices for measuring insurance and participating investment contracts that applied prior to the adoption of IFRS.
The Group, therefore, continues to account for these products using UKGAAP and UK established practice.
Products sold by the life insurance business are classified into three categories: Insurance contracts these contracts transfer significant insurance risk and may also transfer financial risk.
The Group defines significant insurance risk as the possibility of having to pay benefits on the occurrence of an insured event which are significantly more than the benefits payable if the insured event were not to occur.
These contracts may or may not include discretionary participation features.
Investment contracts containing a discretionary participation feature participating investment contracts these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk, but contain a contractual right which gives the holder the right to receive, in addition to the guaranteed benefits, further additional 191 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued discretionary benefits or bonuses that are likely to be a significant proportion of the total contractual benefits and the amount and timing of which is at the discretion of the Group, within the constraints of the terms and conditions of the instrument and based upon the performance of specifiedassets.
Non-participating investment contracts these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk or contain a discretionary participation feature.
The general insurance business issues only insurance contracts.
1 Life insurance business i Accounting for insurance and participating investment contracts Premiums and claims Premiums received in respect of insurance and participating investment contracts are recognised as revenue when due except for unit-linked contracts on which premiums are recognised as revenue when received.
Claims are recorded as an expense on the earlier of the maturity date orthe date on which the claim is notified.
Liabilities Changes in the value of liabilities are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Insurance and participating investment contracts in the Groups with-profit funds Liabilities of the Groups with-profit funds, including guarantees and options embedded within products written by these funds, are stated at their realistic values in accordance with the Prudential Regulation Authoritys realistic capital regime, except that projected transfers out of the funds into other Group funds are recorded in the unallocated surplus see below.
Insurance and participating investment contracts which are not unit-linked or in the Groups with-profit funds A liability for contractual benefits that are expected to be incurred in the future is recorded when the premiums are recognised.
The liability is calculated by estimating the future cash flows over the duration of in-force policies and discounting them back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence.
The liability will vary with movements in interest rates and with the cost of life insurance and annuity benefits where future mortality is uncertain.
Assumptions are made in respect of all material factors affecting future cash flows, including future interest rates, mortality and costs.
Insurance and participating investment contracts which are unit-linked Liabilities for unit-linked insurance contracts and participating investment contracts are stated at the bid value of units plus an additional allowance where appropriate such as for any excess of future expenses over charges.
The liability is increased or reduced by the change in the unit prices and is reduced by policy administration fees, mortality and surrender charges and any withdrawals.
Benefit claims in excess of the account balances incurred in the period are also charged through insurance claims.
Revenue consists of fees deducted for mortality, policy administration and surrender charges.
Unallocated surplus Any amounts in the with-profit funds not yet determined as being due to policyholders or shareholders are recognised as an unallocated surplus which is shown separately from liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.
ii Accounting for non-participating investment contracts The Groups non-participating investment contracts are primarily unit-linked.
These contracts are accounted for as financial liabilities whose value iscontractually linked to the fair values of financial assets within the Groups unitised investment funds.
The value of the unit-linked financial liabilities is determined using current unit prices multiplied by the number of units attributed to the contract holders at the balance sheet date.
Their value is never less than the amount payable on surrender, discounted for the required notice period where applicable.
Investment returns including movements in fair value and investment income allocated to those contracts are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Deposits and withdrawals are not accounted for through the income statement but are accounted for directly in the balance sheet as adjustments to the non-participating investment contract liability.
The Group receives investment management fees in the form of an initial adjustment or charge to the amount invested.
These fees are in respect of services rendered in conjunction with the issue and management of investment contracts where the Group actively manages the consideration received from its customers to fund a return that is based on the investment profile that the customer selected on origination of the contract.
These services comprise an indeterminate number of acts over the lives of the individual contracts and, therefore, the Group defers these fees and recognises them over the estimated lives of the contracts, in line with the provision of investment management services.
Costs which are directly attributable and incremental to securing new non-participating investment contracts are deferred.
This asset is subsequently amortised over the period of the provision of investment management services and its recoverability is reviewed in circumstances where its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If the asset is greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately through fee and commission expense in the income statement.
All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.
iii Value of in-force business The Group recognises as an asset the value of in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.
The asset represents the present value of the shareholders interest in the profits expected to emerge from those contracts written at the balance sheet date.
This is determined after making appropriate assumptions about future economic and operating conditions such as future mortality and persistency rates and includes allowances for both non-market risk and for the realistic value of financial options and guarantees.
Each cash flow is valued using the discount rate consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets.
The asset in the consolidated balance sheet is presented gross of attributable tax and movements in the asset are reflected within other operating income in the incomestatement.
The Groups contractual rights to benefits from providing investment management services in relation to non-participating investment contracts acquired in business combinations and portfolio transfers are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.
The resulting asset is amortised over the estimated lives of the contracts.
At each reporting date an assessment is made to determine if there is any indication of impairment.
Where impairment exists, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss recognised in the income statement.
192 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued 2 General insurance business The Group both underwrites and acts as intermediary in the sale of general insurance products.
Underwriting premiums are included in insurance premium income, net of refunds, in the period in which insurance cover is provided to the customer: premiums received relating to future periods are deferred in the balance sheet within liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts on a basis that reflects the length of time for which contracts have been in force and the projected incidence of risk over the term of the contract and only credited to the income statement when earned.
Broking commission is recognised when the underwriter accepts the risk of providing insurance cover to the customer.
Where appropriate, provision is made for the effect of future policy terminations based upon pastexperience.
The underwriting business makes provision for the estimated cost of claims notified but not settled and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date.
The provision for the cost of claims notified but not settled is based upon a best estimate of the cost of settling the outstanding claims after taking into account all known facts.
In those cases where there is insufficient information to determine the required provision, statistical techniques are used which take into account the cost of claims that have recently been settled and make assumptions about the future development of the outstanding cases.
Similar statistical techniques are used to determine the provision for claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date.
Claims liabilities are not discounted.
3 Liability adequacy test At each balance sheet date liability adequacy tests are performed to ensure the adequacy of insurance and participating investment contract liabilities net of related deferred cost assets and value of in-force business.
In performing these tests current best estimates of discounted future contractual cash flows and claims handling and policy administration expenses, as well as investment income from the assets backing such liabilities, are used.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement, initially by writing off the relevant assets and subsequently byestablishing a provision for losses arising from liability adequacy tests.
4 Reinsurance Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for benefits payable on one or more contracts issued by the Group are recognised as assets arising from reinsurance contracts held.
Where the underlying contracts issued by the Group are classified as insurance contracts and the reinsurance contract transfers significant insurance risk on those contracts to the reinsurer, the assets arising from reinsurance contracts held are classified as insurance contracts.
Where the underlying contracts issued by the Group are classified as non-participating investment contracts and the reinsurance contract transfers financial risk on those contracts to the reinsurer, the assets arising from reinsurance contracts held are classified as non-participating investment contracts.
Assets arising from reinsurance contracts held Classified as insurance contracts Amounts recoverable from or due to reinsurers are measured consistently with the amounts associated with the reinsured contracts and in accordance with the terms of each reinsurance contract and are regularly reviewed for impairment.
Premiums payable for reinsurance contracts are recognised as an expense when due within insurance premium income.
Changes in the reinsurance recoverable assets are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.
Assets arising from reinsurance contracts held Classified as non-participating investment contracts These contracts are accounted for as financial assets whose value is contractually linked to the fair values of financial assets within the reinsurers investment funds.
Investment returns including movements in fair value and investment income allocated to these contracts are recognised in insurance claims.
Deposits and withdrawals are not accounted for through the income statement but are accounted for directly in the balance sheet as adjustments to the assets arising from reinsurance contracts held.
N Foreign currency translation Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the appropriate functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when recognised in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges.
Non-monetary assets that are measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined.
Translation differences on equities and similar non-monetary items held at fair value through profit and loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss.
Translation differences on available-for-sale non-monetary financial assets, such as equity shares, are included in the fair value reserve in equity unless the asset is a hedged item in a fair value hedge.
The results and financial position of all group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into thepresentation currency as follows: the assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity, are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date: and the income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average exchange rates unless these do not approximate to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of a foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity together with exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments see F 3 above.
On disposal or liquidation of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of exchange differences relating to that foreign operation are reclassified from equity and included in determining the profit or loss arising on disposal or liquidation.
O Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are recognised in respect of present obligations arising from past events where it is probable that outflows of resources will be required to settle the obligations and they can be reliably estimated.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence depends on the outcome of uncertain future events or those present obligations where the outflows of resources are uncertain or cannot be measured reliably.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless they are remote.
Provision is made for irrevocable undrawn loan commitments if it is probable that the facility will be drawn and result in the recognition of an asset at an amount less than the amount advanced.
193 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued P Share capital Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividends paid on the Groups ordinary shares are recognised as a reduction in equity in the period in which they are paid.
Where the Company or any member of the Group purchases the Companys share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from shareholders equityas treasury shares until they are cancelled: if these shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholdersequity.
Q Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and non-mandatory balances with central banks and amounts due from banks with a maturity of less than three months.
NOTE 3: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of the Groups financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in applying the accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates.
Estimates, judgements and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The significant judgements made by management in applying the Groups accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty in these financial statements, which together are deemed critical to the Groups results and financial position, are as follows: Allowance for impairment losses on loans and receivables note 21 : Valuation of assets and liabilities arising from insurance business notes 24 and 32 : Defined benefit pension scheme obligations note 36 : Recoverability of deferred tax assets note 37 : Payment protection insurance and other regulatory provisions note 38 : and Fair value of financial instruments note 49.
NOTE 4: SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS Lloyds Banking Group provides a wide range of banking and financial services in the UK and in certain locationsoverseas.
The Group Executive Committee has been determined to be the chief operating decision maker for the Group.
The Groups operating segments reflect its organisational and management structures.
The Group Executive Committee reviews the Groups internal reporting based around these segments in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
GEC considers interest income and expense on a net basis and consequently the total interest income and expense for all reportable segments is presented net.
The segments are differentiated by the type of products provided, by whether the customers are individuals or corporate entities.
The segmental results and comparatives are presented on an underlying basis, the basis reviewed by the chief operating decision maker.
The effects of the following are excluded in arriving at underlyingprofit: losses on redemption of the Enhanced Capital Notes and the volatility in the value of the embedded equity conversion feature: market volatility and other items, which includes the effects of certain asset sales, the volatility relating to the Groups own debt and hedging arrangements as well as that arising in the insurance businesses, insurance gross up, the unwind of acquisition-related fair value adjustments and the amortisation of purchased intangible assets: restructuring costs, which in 2015 and 2016 comprised severance related costs relating to the Simplification programme announced in October 2014 and in 2014 included severance, IT and business costs relating to the programme started in 2011 and the costs of implementing regulatory reform and ring-fencing: TSB build and dual running costs and the loss relating to the TSB sale in 2015: payment protection insurance and other conduct provisions: and certain past service pension credits or charges.
The Groups activities are organised into four financial reporting segments: Retail: Commercial Banking: Consumer Finance and Insurance.
The Groups unsecured personal lending portfolio, previously part of Retail, is now managed by Consumer Finance and elements of the Groups business in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man were transferred from Retail to Commercial Banking: comparatives have been restated accordingly.
Retail offers a broad range of financial service products, including current accounts, savings and mortgages, to UK personal customers, including wealth and small business customers.
It is also a distributor of insurance and a range of long-term savings and investmentproducts.
Commercial Banking is client-led, helping UK-based clients and international clients with a link to the UK.
Through its four client facing divisions SME, Mid Markets, Global Corporates and Financial Institutions it provides clients with a range of products and services such as lending, transactional banking, working capital management, risk management, debt capital markets services, as well as access to private equity through Lloyds Development Capital.
Consumer Finance comprises all the Groups consumer lending products including motor finance, credit cards, and unsecured personal loans along with its European business.
Insurance provides a range of protection, pension and investment products to meet the needs of its customers.
Other includes certain assets previously reported as outside of the Groups risk appetite and the results of businesses disposed.
Other also includes income and expenditure not recharged to divisions, including the costs of certain central and head office functions and the costs of managing the Groups technology platforms, branch and head office property estate, operations including payments, banking operations and collections and sourcing, the costs of which arepredominantly recharged to the other divisions.
It also reflects other items not recharged to the divisions.
194 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 4: SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS continued Inter-segment services are generally recharged at cost, with the exception of the internal commission arrangements between the UK branch and other distribution networks and the insurance product manufacturing businesses within the Group, where a profit margin is also charged.
Inter-segment lending and deposits are generally entered into at market rates, except that non-interest bearing balances are priced at a rate that reflects the external yield that could be earned on such funds.
For the majority of those derivative contracts entered into by business units for risk management purposes, the business unit recognises the net interest income or expense on an accrual accounting basis and transfers the remainder of the movement in the fair value of the derivative to the central group segment where the resulting accounting volatility is managed where possible through the establishment of hedge accounting relationships.
Any change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk is also recorded within the central group segment.
This allocation of the fair value of the derivative and change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk avoids accounting asymmetry in segmental results and leads to accounting volatility, which is managed centrally and reported within Other.

Other services supplied pursuant to legislation relate primarily to the costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act audit requirements together with the cost of the audit of the Groups Form 20-F filing.
Audit related fees: This category includes fees in respect of services for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the financial statements, for example acting as reporting accountants in respect of prospectuses and circulars required by the UKLA listing rules.
Services relating to taxation: This category includes tax compliance and tax advisory services.
Other non-audit fees: This category includes due diligence relating to corporate finance, including venture capital transactions and other assuranceand advisory services.
It is the Groups policy to use the auditors on assignments in cases where their knowledge of the Group means that it is neither efficient nor cost effective to employ another firm of accountants.
Such assignments typically relate to the provision of advice on tax issues, assistance in transactions involving the acquisition and disposal of businesses and accounting advice.
The Group has procedures that are designed to ensure auditor independence, including that fees for audit and non-audit services are approved in advance.
This approval can be obtained either on an individual engagement basis or, for certain types of non-audit services, particularly those of a recurring nature, through the approval of a fee cap covering all engagements of that type provided the fee is below that cap.
All statutory audit work as well as non-audit assignments where the fee is expected to exceed the relevant fee cap must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee on an individual engagement basis.
On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee receives and reviews a report detailing all pre-approved services and amounts paid to theauditors for such pre-approved services.

2 Act 2015 introduced restrictions on the tax deductibility of provisions for conduct charges arising on or after 8July 2015.
This has resulted in an additional income statement tax charge of 219 million 2015: 459 million.
2 In 2016 this includes a 231 million write down of the deferred tax asset held within the life business, reflecting the Groups utilisation estimate which has been restricted by the current economic environment.
2 Act 2015 introduced an additional surcharge of 8 per cent on banking profits from 1 January 2016.
The Finance Act 2016 was enacted on 15 September 2016.
The Act further reduced the corporation tax rate applicable from 1 April 2020 to 17 per cent and further restricts the amount of banks profits that can be offset by carried forward losses for the purposes of calculating corporation tax liabilities from 50 per cent to 25 per cent with effect from 1 April 2016.
The corporation tax changes enacted have resulted in a reduction in the Groups net deferred tax asset at 31 December 2016 of 158million, comprising a 201million charge included in the incomestatement and a 43 million credit included in equity.

For the calculation of diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares that arise in respect of share options and awards granted to employees.
The number of shares that could have been acquired at the average annual share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options and awards is determined.
This is deducted from the number of shares issuable under such options and awards to leave a residual bonus amount of shares which are added to the weighted-average number of ordinary shares in issue, but no adjustment is made to the profit attributable to equity shareholders.
The weighted-average number of anti-dilutive share options and awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share was 0.3million at 31December 2016 2015: 1million: 2014: 7million.

To reduce credit risk the Group uses a variety of credit enhancement techniques such as netting and collateralisation, where security is provided against the exposure.
Further details are provided in note52 Credit risk.
The Group holds derivatives as part of the following strategies: Customer driven, where derivatives are held as part of the provision of risk management products to Group customers: To manage and hedge the Groups interest rate and foreign exchange risk arising from normal banking business.
The hedge accounting strategy adopted by the Group is to utilise a combination of fair value and cash flow hedge approaches as described in note52: and Derivatives held in policyholder funds as permitted by the investment strategies of those funds.
The principal derivatives used by the Group are as follows: Interest rate related contracts include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
An interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange fixed and floating interest payments, based upon interest rates defined in the contract, without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts.
Forward rate agreements are contracts for the payment of the difference between a specified rate of interest and a reference rate, applied to a notional principal amount at a specific date in the future.
An interest rate option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to fix the rate of interest on a future loan or deposit, for a specified period and commencing on a specified future date.
206 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 16: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Exchange rate related contracts include forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and options.
A forward foreign exchange contract isan agreement to buy or sell a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified future date at an agreed rate.
Currency swaps generally involve the exchange of interest payment obligations denominated in different currencies: the exchange of principal can be notional or actual.
Acurrency option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to sell specified amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on or before a specified future date.
Credit derivatives, principally credit default swaps, are used by the Group as part of its trading activity and to manage its own exposure to credit risk.
A credit default swap is a swap in which one counterparty receives a premium at pre-set intervals in consideration for guaranteeing to make a specific payment should a negative credit event take place.
The Group also used credit default swaps to securitise, in combination with external funding, 455million of corporate and commercial banking loans at 31 December 2015: these arrangements were wound up during 2016.
Equity derivatives are also used by the Group as part of its equity-based retail product activity to eliminate the Groups exposure to fluctuations invarious international stock exchange indices.
Index-linked equity options are purchased which give the Group the right, but not the obligation, tobuy or sell a specified amount of equities, or basket of equities, in the form of published indices on or before a specified future date.

208 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 19: SECURITISATIONS AND COVERED BONDS Securitisation programmes Loans and advances to customers and debt securities classified as loans and receivables include loans securitised under the Groups securitisation programmes, the majority of which have been sold by subsidiary companies to bankruptcy remote structured entities.
As the structured entities are funded by the issue of debt on terms whereby the majority of the risks and rewards of the portfolio are retained by the subsidiary, the structured entities are consolidated fully and all of these loans are retained on the Groups balance sheet, with the related notes in issue included within debt securities inissue.
Covered bond programmes Certain loans and advances to customers have been assigned to bankruptcy remote limited liability partnerships to provide security for issues of covered bonds by the Group.
The Group retains all of the risks and rewards associated with these loans and the partnerships are consolidated fully with the loans retained on the Groups balance sheet and the related covered bonds in issue included within debt securities in issue.
The Groups principal securitisation and covered bond programmes, together with the balances of the advances subject to these arrangements and the carrying value of the notes in issue at 31December, are listed below.
The notes in issue are reported in note31.

Cash deposits of 9,018million 2015: 8,383million which support the debt securities issued by the structured entities, the term advances related to covered bonds and other legal obligations are held by the Group.
Additionally, the Group had certain contractual arrangements to provide liquidity facilities to some of these structured entities.
At 31December 2016 these obligations had not been triggered: the maximum exposure under these facilities was 373million 2015:381million.
The Group has a number of covered bond programmes, for which Limited Liability Partnerships have been established to ring-fence asset pools and guarantee the covered bonds issued by the Group.
At the reporting date the Group had over-collateralised these programmes as set out in the table above to meet the terms of the programmes, to secure the rating of the covered bonds and to provide operational flexibility.
From time-to-time, the obligations of the Group to provide collateral may increase due to the formal requirements of the programmes.
The Group may also voluntarily contribute collateral to support the ratings of the covered bonds.
The Group recognises the full liabilities associated with its securitisation and covered bond programmes within debt securities in issue, although the obligations of the Group are limited to the cash flows generated from the underlying assets.
The Group could be required to provide additional support to a number of the securitisation programmes to support the credit ratings of the debt securities issued, in the form of increased cash reserves and the holding of subordinated notes.
Further, certain programmes contain contractual obligations that require the Group to repurchase assets should they become credit impaired.
The Group has not voluntarily offered to repurchase assets from any of its public securitisation programmes during 2016 2015:none.
Such repurchases are made in order to ensure that the expected maturity dates of the notes issued from these programmes are met.
209 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued NOTE 20: STRUCTURED ENTITIES The Groups interests in structured entities are both consolidated and unconsolidated.
Detail of the Groups interests in consolidated structured entities are set out in: note 19 for securitisations and covered bond vehicles, note36 for structured entities associated with the Groups pension schemes, and below in part A and B.
Details of the Groups interests in unconsolidated structured entities are included below in part C. A Asset-backed conduits In addition to the structured entities discussed in note19, which are used for securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group sponsors an active assetbacked conduit, Cancara, which invests in client receivables and debt securities.
The total consolidated exposure of Cancara at 31December 2016 was 6,840million 2015:7,295million, comprising 6,684million of loans and advances 2015:6,440million and 156million ofdebt securities 2015:855million.
All lending assets and debt securities held by the Group in Cancara are restricted in use, as they are held by the collateral agent for the benefit of the commercial paper investors and the liquidity providers only.
The Group provides liquidity facilities to Cancara under terms that are usual and customary for standard lending activities in the normal course of the Groups banking activities.
During 2016 there has been a planned drawdown on certain liquidity facilities for balance sheet management purposes, supporting the programme to provide funding alongside the proceeds of the assetbacked commercial paper issuance.
The Group could be asked to provide further support under the contractual terms of these arrangements including, for example, if Cancara experienced a shortfall in external funding, which may occur in the event of market disruption.
As at 31December 2015 there had been no drawdowns on these liquidity facilities.
The external assets in Cancara are consolidated in the Groups financialstatements.
B Consolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships The assets and liabilities of the Insurance business held in consolidated collective investment vehicles, such as OpenEnded Investment Companies and limited partnerships, are not directly available for use by the Group.
However, the Groups investment in the majority of these collective investment vehicles is readily realisable.
As at 31 December 2016, the total carrying value of these consolidated collective investment vehicle assets and liabilities held by the Group was 75,669million 2015: 67,122million.
The Group has no contractual arrangements such as liquidity facilities that would require it to provide financial or other support to the consolidated collective investment vehicles: the Group has not previously provided such support and has no current intentions to provide suchsupport.
C Unconsolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships The Groups direct interests in unconsolidated structured entities comprise investments in collective investment vehicles, such as OpenEnded Investment Companies, and limited partnerships with a total carrying value of 15,611million at 31 December 2016 2015: 13,282million, included within financial assets designated at fair value through profit and loss see note 15.
These investments include both those entities managed by third parties and those managed by the Group.
At 31 December 2016, the total asset value of these unconsolidated structured entities, including the portion in which the Group has no interest, was 1,849billion 2015:603billion.
The Groups maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying value of the investment.
However, the Groups investments in these entities are primarily held to match policyholder liabilities in the Insurance division and the majority of the risk from a change in the value of the Groups investment is matched by a change in policyholder liabilities.
The collective investment vehicles are primarily financed by investments from investors in thevehicles.
During the year the Group has not provided any noncontractual financial or other support to these entities and has no current intention of providing any financial or other support.
There were no transfers from to these unconsolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships.
The Group considers itself the sponsor of a structured entity where it is primarily involved in the design and establishment of the structured entity: and further where the Group transfers assets to the structured entity: market products associated with the structured entity in its own name and or provide guarantees regarding the structured entitys performance.
The Group sponsors a range of diverse investment funds and limited partnerships where it acts as the fund manager or equivalent decision maker and markets the funds under one of the Groups brands.
The Group earns fees from managing the investments of these funds.
The investment management fees that the Group earned from these entities, including those in which the Group held no ownership interest at 31 December 2016, are reported in note6.
NOTE 21: ALLOWANCE FOR IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON LOANS AND RECEIVABLES Critical accounting estimates and judgments The allowance for impairment losses on loans and receivables is managements best estimate of losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date.
In determining the required level of impairment provisions, the Group uses the output from various statistical models.
Management judgement is required to assess the robustness of the outputs from these models and, where necessary, make appropriate adjustments.
Impairment allowances are made up of two components, those determined individually and those determined collectively.
Individual impairment allowances are generally established against the Groups commercial lending portfolios.
Assets are reviewed on a regular basis and those showing potential or actual vulnerability are placed on a watchlist where greater monitoring is undertaken and any adverse or potentially adverse impact on ability to repay is used in assessing whether an asset should be transferred to a dedicated Business Support Unit.
Specific examples of trigger events that could lead to the initial recognition of impairment allowances against lending to corporate borrowers or the recognition of additional impairment allowances include i trading losses, loss of business or major customer of a borrower: ii material breaches of the terms and conditions of a loan facility, including nonpayment of interest or principal, or a fall in the value of security such that it is no longer considered adequate: iii disappearance of an active market because of financial difficulties: or iv restructuring a facility with preferential terms to aid recovery of the lending such as a debt for equityswap.
For such individually identified financial assets, a review is undertaken of the expected future cash flows which requires significant management judgement as to the amount and timing of such cash flows.
Where the debt is secured, the assessment reflects the expected cash flows from the realisation of the security, net of costs to realise, whether or not foreclosure or realisation of the collateral is probable.
The determination of individual impairment allowances requires the exercise of considerable judgement by management involving matters such as local economic conditions and the resulting trading performance of the customer, and the value of the security held, for which there may not be a readily accessible market.
The actual amount of the future cash flows and their timing may differ significantly from the assumptions made for the purposes of determining the impairment allowances and consequently these allowances can be subject to variation as time progresses and the circumstances of the customer become clearer.
210 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 21: ALLOWANCE FOR IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON LOANS AND RECEIVABLES continued Collective impairment allowances are generally established for smaller balance homogenous portfolios such as the retail portfolios.
For these portfolios the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar risk characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment.
Segmentation takes into account factors such as the type of asset, industry sector, geographical location, collateral type, pastdue status and other relevant factors.
These characteristics are relevant to the estimation of future cash flows for groups of such assets as they are indicative of the borrowers ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated.
Generally, the impairment trigger used within the impairment calculation for a loan, or group of loans, is when they reach a predefined level of delinquency or where the customer is bankrupt.
Loans where the Group provides arrangements that forgive a portion of interest or principal are also deemed to be impaired and loans that are originated to refinance currently impaired assets are also defined as impaired.
In respect of the Groups secured mortgage portfolios, the impairment allowance is calculated based on a definition of impaired loans which are those six months or more in arrears or certain cases where the borrower is bankrupt or is in possession.
The estimated cash flows are calculated based on historical experience and are dependent on estimates of the expected value of collateral which takes into account expected future movements in house prices, less costs to sell.
For unsecured personal lending portfolios, the impairment trigger is generally when the balance is two or more instalments in arrears or where the customer has exhibited one or more of the impairment characteristics set out above.
While the trigger is based on the payment performance or circumstances of each individual asset, the assessment of future cash flows uses historical experience of cohorts of similar portfolios such that the assessment is considered to be collective.
Future cash flows are estimated on the basis of the contractual cash flows of the assets in the cohort and historical loss experience for similar assets.
The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly by the Group to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual lossexperience.
The collective impairment allowance is also subject to estimation uncertainty and in particular is sensitive to changes in economic and credit conditions, including the interdependency of house prices, unemployment rates, interest rates, borrowers behaviour, and consumer bankruptcy trends.
It is, however, inherently difficult to estimate how changes in one or more of these factors might impact the collective impairment allowance.
The value of collateral supporting the Groups UK mortgage portfolio is estimated by applying changes in the house price indices to the original assessed value of the property.
Given the relative size of the portfolio, this is a key variable in determining the Groups impairment charge for loans and receivables.
If average house prices were ten per cent lower than those estimated at 31 December 2016, the impairment charge would increase by approximately 190 million in respect of UKmortgages.
In addition, the collective provision also includes provision for inherent losses, that is losses that have been incurred but have not been separately identified at the balance sheet date.
The loans that are not currently recognised as impaired are grouped into homogenous portfolios by key risk drivers.
Risk drivers for secured retail lending include the current indexed loantovalue, previous mortgage arrears, internal crossproduct delinquency data and external credit bureau data: for unsecured retail lending they include whether the account is uptodate and, if not, the number of payments that have been missed: and for commercial lending they include factors such as observed default rates and loss given default.
An assessment is made of the likelihood of assets being impaired at the balance sheet date and being identified subsequently: the length of time taken to identify that an impairment event has occurred is known as the loss emergence period.
The loss emergence period is determined by local management for each portfolio and the Group has a range of loss emergence periods which are dependent upon the characteristics of the portfolios.
Loss emergence periods are reviewed regularly and updated when appropriate.
Ingeneral the periods used across the Group vary between one month and twelve months based on historical experience.
Unsecured portfolios tend to have shorter loss emergence periods than secured portfolios.
This provision is sensitive to changes in the loss emergence period.
Management use a significant level of judgement when determining the collective unidentified impairment provision, including the assessment of the level of overall risk existing within particular sectors and the impact of the low interest rate environment on loss emergence periods.
In the Commercial Banking division, an increase of one month in the loss emergence period in respect of the loan portfolio assessed for collective unidentified impairment provisions would result in an increase in the collective unidentified impairment provision of approximately 33million 2015:36million.

The goodwill held in the Groups balance sheet is tested at least annually for impairment.
For the purposes of impairment testing the goodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash generating unit: of the total balance of 2,016million 2015: 2,016million, 1,836million, or 91percent of the total 2015: 1,836million, 91percent of the total has been allocated to Scottish Widows in the Groups Insurance division and 170million, or 8percent of the total 2015: 170million, 8percent of the total to Motor Finance in the Groups Consumer Finance division.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Scottish Widows has been based on a value-in-use calculation.
The calculation uses pre-tax projections of future cash flows based upon budgets and plans approved by management covering a five-year period, the related run-off of existing business in force and a discount rate of 10percent.
The budgets and plans are based upon past experience adjusted to take into account anticipated changes in sales volumes, product mix and margins having regard to expected market conditions and competitor activity.
The discount rate is determined with reference to internal measures and available industry information.
New business cash flows beyond the five-year period have been extrapolated using a steady 3percent growth rate which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the life assurance market.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of Scottish Widows to fall below its balance sheet carrying value.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Motor Finance has also been based on a value-in-use calculation using pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a five-year period and a discount rate of 14 percent.
The cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 0.5percent which does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which Motor Finance participates.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of Motor Finance to fall below the balance sheet carrying value.

The valuation of this asset requires assumptions to be made about future economic and operating conditions which are inherently uncertain and changes could significantly affect the value attributed to this asset.
The methodology used to value this asset and the key assumptions that have been made in determining the carrying value of the value of in-force business asset at 31 December 2016 are set out below.
Key assumptions The principal features of the methodology and process used for determining key assumptions used in the calculation of the value of in-force business are set out below: Economic assumptions Each cash flow is valued using the discount rate consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets.
In practice, to achieve thesame result, where the cash flows are either independent of or move linearly with market movements, a method has been applied known as the certainty equivalent approach whereby it is assumed that all assets earn a risk-free rate and all cash flows are discounted at a risk-free rate.
The certainty equivalent approach covers all investment assets relating to insurance and participating investment contracts, other than the annuity business where an illiquidity premium is included, see below.
A market-consistent approach has been adopted for the valuation of financial options and guarantees, using a stochastic option pricing technique calibrated to be consistent with the market price of relevant options at each valuation date.
Further information on options and guarantees can be found in note 32.
The liabilities in respect of the Groups UK annuity business are matched by a portfolio of fixed interest securities, including a large proportion of corporate bonds and illiquid loan assets.
The value of the in-force business asset for UK annuity business has been calculated after taking into account an estimate of the market premium for illiquidity in respect of corporate bond holdings and relevant illiquid loan assets.
In determining the market premium for illiquidity, we consider a range of inputs which reflect actual asset allocation and relevant observable market data.
The illiquidity premium is estimated to be 138basis points at 31December 2016 2015: range of 85 to 144basispoints.
The risk-free rate is derived from the relevant swap curve with a deduction for credit risk.
The table below shows the resulting range of yields and other key assumptions at 31December: 2016 2015 % % 1 Risk-free rate value of in-force non-annuity business 0.00 to 4.20 0.00 to 4.20 1 Risk-free rate value of in-force annuity business 1.38 to 5.58 0.85 to 5.64 1 Risk-free rate financial options and guarantees 0.00 to 4.20 0.00 to 2.54 Retail price inflation 3.50 3.27 Expense inflation 3.73 3.65 1 All risk-free rates are quoted as the range of rates implied by the relevant swap curve.
Non-market risk An allowance for non-market risk is made through the choice of best estimate assumptions based upon experience, which generally will give the mean expected financial outcome for shareholders and hence no further allowance for non-market risk is required.
However, in the case ofoperational risk, reinsurer default and the with-profit funds these can be asymmetric in the range of potential outcomes for which an explicit allowance is made.
Non-economic assumptions Future mortality, morbidity, expenses, lapse and paid-up rate assumptions are reviewed each year and are based on an analysis of past experience and on managements view of future experience.
Further information on these assumptions is given in note 32 and the effect of changes in key assumptions is given in note 33.

The primary purpose of the conventional and unitised business written in the with-profit funds is to provide a smoothed investment vehicle to policyholders, protecting them against short-term market fluctuations.
Payouts may be subject to a guaranteed minimum payout if certain policy conditions are met.
With-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90percent of the distributed profits, with the shareholders receiving the balance.
The policyholders are also usually insured against death and the policy may carry a guaranteed annuity option at retirement.
ii Method of calculation of liabilities With-profit liabilities are stated at their realistic value, the main components of which are: With-profit benefit reserve, the total asset shares for with-profit policies: Cost of options and guarantees including guaranteed annuity options : Deductions levied against asset shares: Planned enhancements to with-profits benefits reserve: and Impact of the smoothing policy.
iii Assumptions Key assumptions used in the calculation of with-profit liabilities, and the processes for determining these, are: Investment returns and discount rates With-profit fund liabilities are valued on a market-consistent basis, achieved by the use of a valuation model which values liabilities on a basis calibrated to tradable market option contracts and other observable market data.
The with-profit fund financial options and guarantees are valued using a stochastic simulation model where all assets are assumed to earn, on average, the risk-free yield and all cash flows are discounted using the risk-free yield.
The risk-free yield is defined as the spot yield derived from the relevant swap curve, adjusted for credit risk.
Further information on significant options and guarantees is given below.
Guaranteed annuity option take-up rates Certain pension contracts contain guaranteed annuity options that allow the policyholder to take an annuity benefit on retirement at annuity rates that were guaranteed at the outset of the contract.
For contracts that contain such options, key assumptions in determining the cost of options are economic conditions in which the option has value, mortality rates and take up rates of other options.
The financial impact is dependent on the value of corresponding investments, interest rates and longevity at the time of the claim.
Investment volatility The calibration of the stochastic simulation model uses implied volatilities of derivatives where possible, or historical volatility where it is not possible to observe meaningful prices.
Mortality The mortality assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity for annuitants, are set with regard to the Groups actual experience where this is significant, and relevant industry data otherwise.
Lapse rates persistency Lapse rates refer to the rate of policy termination or the rate at which policyholders stop paying regular premiums due under the contract.
Historical persistency experience is analysed using statistical techniques.
As experience can vary considerably between different product types and for contracts that have been in force for different periods, the data is broken down into broadly homogenous groups for the purposes of this analysis.
The most recent experience is considered along with the results of previous analyses and managements views on future experience, taking into consideration potential changes in future experience that may result from guarantees and options becoming more valuable under adverse market conditions, in order to determine a best estimate view of what persistency will be.
In determining this best estimate view a number of factors are considered, including the credibility of the results which will be affected by the volume of data available, any exceptional events that have occurred during the period under consideration, any known or expected trends in underlying data and relevant published market data.
218 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 32: LIABILITIES ARISING FROM INSURANCE CONTRACTS AND PARTICIPATING INVESTMENT CONTRACTS continued iv Options and guarantees within the With-Profit Funds The most significant options and guarantees provided from within the With-Profit Funds are in respect of guaranteed minimum cash benefits on death, maturity, retirement or certain policy anniversaries, and guaranteed annuity options on retirement for certain pension policies.
For those policies written in Scottish Widows pre-demutualisation containing potentially valuable options and guarantees, under the terms of the Scheme a separate memorandum account was set up, within the With-Profit Fund originally held in Scottish Widows plc and subsequently transferred into Scottish Widows Limited, called the Additional Account which is available, inter alia, to meet any additional costs of providing guaranteed benefits in respect of those policies.
The Additional Account had a value at 31 December 2016 of 2.7 billion 2015: 2.5 billion.
The eventual cost of providing benefits on policies written both pre and post demutualisation is dependent upon a large number of variables, including future interest rates and equity values, demographic factors, such as mortality, and the proportion of policyholders who seek to exercise their options.
The ultimate cost will therefore not be known for many years.
As noted above, the liabilities of the With-Profit Funds are valued using a market-consistent stochastic simulation model which places a value on the options and guarantees which captures both their intrinsic value and their time value.
The most significant economic assumptions included in the model are risk-free yield and investment volatility.
Non-profit fund liabilities i Business description The Group principally writes the following types of life insurance contracts within its non-profit funds.
Shareholder profits on these types of business arise from management fees and other policy charges.
Unit-linked business This includes unit-linked pensions and unit-linked bonds, the primary purpose of which is to provide an investment vehicle where the policyholder is also insured against death.
Life insurance The policyholder is insured against death or permanent disability, usually for predetermined amounts.
Such business includes whole of life and term assurance and long-term creditor policies.
Annuities The policyholder is entitled to payments for the duration of their life and is therefore insured against surviving longer than expected.
ii Method of calculation of liabilities The non-profit fund liabilities are determined on the basis of recognised actuarial methods and involve estimating future policy cash flows over the duration of the in-force book of policies, and discounting the cash flows back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence.
iii Assumptions Generally, assumptions used to value non-profit fund liabilities are prudent in nature and therefore contain a margin for adverse deviation.
Thismargin for adverse deviation is based on managements judgement and reflects managements views on the inherent level of uncertainty.
Thekey assumptions used in the measurement of non-profit fund liabilities are: Interest rates The rates of interest used are determined byreference to a number of factors including the redemption yields on fixed interest assets at the valuationdate.
Margins for risk are allowed for in the assumed interest rates.
These are derived from the limits in the guidelines set by local regulatory bodies, including reductions made to the available yields to allow for default risk based upon the credit rating of the securities allocated to the insurance liability.
Mortality and morbidity The mortality and morbidity assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity for annuitants, are set with regard to the Groups actual experience where this provides a reliable basis, and relevant industry data otherwise, and include a margin for adverse deviation.
Lapse rates persistency Lapse rates are allowed for on some non-profit fund contracts.
The process for setting these rates is as described for with-profit liabilities, however a prudent scenario is assumed by the inclusion of a margin for adverse deviation within the non-profit fund liabilities.
Maintenance expenses Allowance is made for future policy costs explicitly.
Expenses are determined by reference to an internal analysis of current and expected future costs plus a margin for adverse deviation.
Explicit allowance is made for future expense inflation.
Key changes in assumptions A detailed review of the Groups assumptions in 2016 resulted in the following key impacts on profit before tax: Change in persistency assumptions 48 million decrease.
Change in the assumption in respect of current and future mortality and morbidity rates 194 million increase.
Change in expenses assumptions 109 million decrease.
These amounts include the impacts of movements in liabilities and value of the in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.
iv Options and guarantees outside the With-Profit Funds A number of typical guarantees are provided outside the With-Profit Funds such as guaranteed payments on death e. g. term assurance or guaranteed income for life e. g. annuities.
In addition, certain personal pension policyholders in Scottish Widows, for whom reinstatement to their occupational pension scheme was not an option, have been given a guarantee that their pension and other benefits will correspond in value to the benefits of the relevant occupational pension scheme.
The key assumptions affecting the ultimate value of the guarantee are future salary growth, gilt yields at retirement, annuitant mortality at retirement, marital status at retirement and future investment returns.
There is currently a provision, calculated on a deterministic basis, of 82 million 2015: 68 million in respect of those guarantees.

220 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 33: LIFE INSURANCE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Critical accounting estimates and judgments Elements of the valuations of liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts require assumptions to be made about future investment returns, future mortality rates and future policyholder behaviour and are subject to significant management judgement and estimation uncertainty.
The methodology used to value these liabilities and the key assumptions that have been made in determining their carrying value are set out in note 32.
The following table demonstrates the effect of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on profit before tax and equity disclosed in these financial statements assuming that the other assumptions remain unchanged.
In practice this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some assumptions may be correlated.
These amounts include movements in assets, liabilities and the value of the in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.
The impact is shown in one direction but can be assumed to be reasonably symmetrical.

8 This sensitivity shows the impact of a 25 basis point increase in credit default spreads on corporate bonds and the corresponding reduction in market values.
Swap curves, the risk-free rate and illiquidity premia are all assumed to be unchanged.
9 This sensitivity shows the impact of a 10 basis point increase in the allowance for illiquidity premia.
It assumes the overall spreads on assets are unchanged and hence market values are unchanged.
Swap curves and the non-annuity risk-free rate are both assumed to be unchanged.
The increased illiquidity premium increases the annuity risk-free rate.

The key areas of estimation uncertainty are the discount rate applied to future cash flows and the expected lifetime of the schemes members.
The discount rate is required to be set with reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds in the currency and with a term consistent with the defined benefit pension schemes obligations.
The average duration of the schemes obligations is approximately 20 years.
The market for bonds with a similar duration is illiquid and, as a result, significant management judgement is required to determine an appropriate yield curve on which to base the discount rate.
The cost of the benefits payable by the schemes will also depend upon the life expectancy of the members.
The Group considers latest market practice and actual experience in determining the appropriate assumptions for both current mortality expectations and the rate of future mortality improvement.
Given the advances in medical science in recent years, it is uncertain whether this rate of improvement will be sustained going forward and, as a result, actual experience may differ from current expectations.
The effect on the net accounting surplus or deficit and on the pension charge in the Groups income statement of changes to the principal actuarial assumptions is set out in iii below.
i Characteristics of and risks associated with the Groups schemes The Group has established a number of defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and overseas.
All significant schemes are based in the UK, with the three most significant being the defined benefit sections of the Lloyds Bank Pension Schemes Nos 1 and 2 and the HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme.
These schemes provide retirement benefits calculated as a percentage of final pensionable salary depending upon the length of service: the minimum retirement age under the rules of the schemes at 31December 2016 is generally 55 although certain categories of member are deemed to have a contractual right to retire at50.
The Group operates a number of funded and unfunded pension arrangements, the majority, including the three most significant schemes, are funded schemes in the UK.
All these schemes are operated as separate legal entities under trust law by the trustees and are in compliance with the Pensions Act 2004.
A valuation exercise is carried out for each scheme at least every three years, whereby scheme assets are measured at market value and liabilities technical provisions are measured using prudent assumptions.
If a deficit is identified a recovery plan is agreed between the Group and the scheme Trustee and sent to the Pensions Regulator for review.
The Group has not provided for these deficit contributions as the future economic benefits arising from these contributions are expected to be available to the Group.
The Groups overseas defined benefit pension schemes are subject to local regulatory arrangements.
The latest full valuations of the three main schemes were carried out as at 30June 2014: the results have been updated to 31December 2016 by qualified independent actuaries.
The last full valuations of other Group schemes were carried out on a number of different dates: these have been updated to 31December 2016 by qualified independent actuaries.
During 2009, the Group made one-off contributions to the LloydsBank Pension Scheme No 1 and Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No2 in the form of interests in limited liability partnerships for each of the twoschemes which hold assets to provide security for the Groups obligations to the two schemes.
At 31December 2016, the limited liability partnerships held assets of approximately 5.4billion.
The limited liability partnerships are consolidated fully in the Groups balance sheet.
The Group has also established three private limited companies which hold assets to provide security for the Groups obligations to the HBOSFinal Salary Pension Scheme, a section of the LloydsBank Pension Scheme No1 and the Lloyds Bank Offshore Pension Scheme.
At 31December2016 these held assets of approximately 4.8billion in aggregate.
The private limited companies are consolidated fully in the Groups balance sheet.
The terms of these arrangements require the Group to maintain assets in these vehicles to agreed minimum values in order to secure obligations owed to the relevant Group pension schemes.
The Group has satisfied this requirement during 2016.
The Group currently expects to pay contributions of approximately 575million to its defined benefit schemes in 2017.
The responsibility for the governance of the Groups funded defined benefit pension schemes lies with the Pension Trustees.
Each of the Groups funded UK defined benefit pension schemes are managed by a Trustee Board the Trustee whose role is to ensure that their Scheme is administered in accordance with the Scheme rules and relevant legislation, and to safeguard the assets in the best interests of all members and beneficiaries.
The Trustee is solely responsible for setting investment policy and for agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the triennial valuation process.
The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company and plan participants in accordance with the Schemesregulations.

The table shows that a member retiring at age 60 at 31December 2016 is assumed to live for, on average, 28.1 years for a male and 30.3 years for a female.
In practice there will be much variation between individual members but these assumptions are expected to be appropriate across all members.
It is assumed that younger members will live longer in retirement than those retiring now.
This reflects the expectation that mortality rates will continue to fall over time as medical science and standards of living improve.
To illustrate the degree of improvement assumed the table also shows the life expectancy for members aged 45 now, when they retire in 15 years time at age 60. iii Amount timing and uncertainty of future cash flows Risk exposure of the defined benefit schemes Whilst the Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or scheme specific risks in its defined benefit pension schemes, it is exposed to a number of significant risks, detailed below: Inflation rate risk: the majority of the plans benefit obligations are linked to inflation both in deferment and once in payment.
Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although this will be partially offset by holdings of inflation-linked gilts and, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
Interest rate risk: The defined benefit obligation is determined using a discount rate derived from yields on AA-rated corporate bonds.
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of bond holdings.
Longevity risk: The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
Investment risk: Scheme assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of debt securities, equities and other return-seeking assets.
If the assets underperform the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation, it will reduce the surplus or increase the deficit.
Volatility in asset values and the discount rate will lead to volatility in the net pension liability on the Groups balance sheet and in other comprehensive income.
To a lesser extent this will also lead to volatility in the pension expense in the Groups income statement.
The ultimate cost of the defined benefit obligations to the Group will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions made.
The assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost may be higher or lower than expected.
Sensitivity analysis The effect of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on the value of scheme liabilities and the resulting pension charge in the Groups income statement and on the net defined benefit pension scheme liability, for the Groups three most significant schemes, is set out below.
The sensitivities provided assume that all other assumptions and the value of the schemes assets remain unchanged, and are not intended to represent changes that are at the extremes of possibility.
The calculations are approximate in nature and full detailed calculations could lead to a different result.
It is unlikely that isolated changes to individual assumptions will be experienced in practice.
Due to the correlation of assumptions, aggregating the effects of these isolated changes may not be a reasonable estimate of the actual effect of simultaneous changes in multiple assumptions.

2 At 31December2016, the assumed discount rate is 2.76percent 2015: 3.87percent.
Sensitivity analysis method and assumptions The sensitivity analysis above reflects the impact on the Groups three most significant schemes which account for over 90percent of the Groups defined benefit obligations.
Whilst differences in the underlying liability profiles for the remainder of the Groups pension arrangements mean they may exhibit slightly different sensitivities to variations in these assumptions, the sensitivities provided above are indicative of the impact across the Group as awhole.
The inflation assumption sensitivity applies to both the assumed rate of increase in the Consumer Prices Index CPI and the Retail Prices Index RPI, and include the impact on the rate of increases to pensions, both before and after retirement.
These pension increases are linked to inflation either CPI or RPI subject to certain minimum and maximum limits.
The sensitivity analysis including the inflation sensitivity does not include the impact of any change in the rate of salary increases as pensionable salaries have been frozen since 2April2014.
The life expectancy assumption has been applied by allowing for an increase decrease in life expectation from age 60 of one year, based upon the approximate weighted average age for each scheme.
Whilst this is an approximate approach and will not give the same result as a one year increase in life expectancy at every age, it provides an appropriate indication of the potential impact on the schemes from changes in life expectancy.
There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from the prior year.
Asset-liability matching strategies The main schemes assets are invested in a diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of debt securities.
The investment strategy is not static and will evolve to reflect the structure of liabilities within the schemes.
Specific asset-liability matching strategies for each pension plan are independently determined by the responsible governance body for each scheme and in consultation with the employer.
A significant goal of the asset-liability matching strategies adopted by Group schemes is to reduce volatility caused by changes in market expectations of interest rates and inflation.
In the main schemes, this is achieved by investing scheme assets in bonds, primarily fixed interest gilts and index linked gilts, and by entering into interest rate and inflation swap arrangements.
These investments are structured to take into account the profile of scheme liabilities, and actively managed to reflect both changing market conditions and changes to the liability profile.
At 31 December 2016 the asset-liability matching strategy mitigated 89 per cent of the liability sensitivity to interest rate movements and 102percent of the liability sensitivity to inflation movements.
Much of the residual interest rate sensitivity is mitigated through holdings of corporate and other debtsecurities.
Maturity profile of defined benefit obligation The following table provides information on the weighted average duration of the defined benefit pension obligations and the distribution and timing of benefit payments: 2016 2015 Years Years Duration of the defined benefit obligation 20 19 2016 2015 m m Maturity analysis of benefits expected to be paid Benefits expected to be paid within 12 months 1,639 1,370 Benefits expected to be paid between 1 and 2 years 1,180 1,121 Benefits expected to be paid between 2 and 5 years 3,971 3,759 Benefits expected to be paid between 5 and 10 years 8,030 7,710 Benefits expected to be paid between 10 and 15 years 9,453 9,102 Benefits expected to be paid between 15 and 25 years 20,268 19,882 Benefits expected to be paid between 25 and 35 years 18,831 18,631 Benefits expected to be paid between 35 and 45 years 13,589 13,878 Benefits expected to be paid in more than 45 years 7,809 8,857 227 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued NOTE 36: RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued Maturity analysis method and assumptions The projected benefit payments are based on the assumptions underlying the assessment of the obligations, including allowance for expected future inflation.
They are shown in their undiscounted form and therefore appear large relative to the discounted assessment of the defined benefit obligations recognised in the Groups balance sheet.
They are in respect of benefits that have been accrued prior to the respective year-end date only and make no allowance for any benefits that may have been accrued subsequently.
Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas, principally Your Tomorrow and the defined contribution sections ofthe Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No.
During the year ended 31December 2016 the charge to the income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was 268million 2015:233million: 2014:252million, representing the contributions payable by the employer in accordance with each schemes rules.
Other post-retirement benefit schemes The Group operates a number of schemes which provide post-retirement healthcare benefits and concessionary mortgages to certain employees, retired employees and their dependants.
The principal scheme relates to former Lloyds Bank staff and under this scheme the Group has undertaken to meet the cost of post-retirement healthcare for all eligible former employees and their dependants who retired prior to 1January 1996.
The Group has entered into an insurance contract to provide these benefits and a provision has been made for the estimated cost of future insurance premiums payable.
For the principal post-retirement healthcare scheme, the latest actuarial valuation of the liability was carried out at 31December 2014 by qualified independent actuaries.
The principal assumptions used were as set out above, except that the rate of increase in healthcare premiums has been assumed at 6.84percent 2015: 6.59percent.

The recoverability of the Groups deferred tax assets in respect of carry forward losses is based on an assessment of future levels of taxable profit expected to arise that can be offset against these losses.
The Groups expectations as to the level of future taxable profits take into account the Groups long-term financial and strategic plans, and anticipated future tax adjusting items.
In making this assessment account is taken of business plans, the board approved operating plan and the expected future economic outlook as set out in the Group Chief Executives Review and Market Overview, as well as the risks associated with future regulatory change.
The Groups total deferred tax asset includes 4,298 million 2015: 4,890 million in respect of trading losses carried forward.
The tax losses have arisen in individual legal entities and will be used as future taxable profits arise in those legal entities, though substantially all of the unused tax losses for which a deferred tax asset has been recognised arise in Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds Bank plc.
The deferred tax asset is expected to be utilised over different time periods in each of the entities in which the losses arise.
Under current UK tax law there is no expiry date for unused tax losses.
Following the enactment of the Finance Acts in 2015 and 2016, there is a restriction imposed on the amount of banks profits that can be offset by certain carried forward tax losses for the purposes of calculating corporation tax liabilities.
The additional restriction in 2016 has increased the period over which the Group expects to fully utilise its tax losses from 2025 to 2031.

Deferred tax assets not recognised Deferred tax assets of 92million 2015:140million have not been recognised in respect of capital losses carried forward as there are no predicted future capital profits.
Capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
Deferred tax assets of 723million 2015: 893million have not been recognised in respect of trading losses carried forward, mainly in respect of temporary differences in the insurance businesses and in certain overseas companies.
Trading losses can be carried forward indefinitely, except for losses in the USA which expire after 20 years.
In addition, deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unrelieved foreign tax carried forward at 31December 2016 of 46million 2015:76million, as there are no predicted future taxable profits against which the unrelieved foreign tax credits can be utilised.
These tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.
NOTE 38: OTHER PROVISIONS Critical accounting estimates and judgments At 31 December 2016, the Group carried provisions of 3,597 million 2015: 4,463 million against the cost of making redress payments to customers and the related administration costs in connection with historical regulatory breaches, principally the mis-selling of payment protection insurance 2016:2,258million: 2015: 3,458million.
Determining the amount of the provisions, which represent managements best estimate of the cost of settling these issues, requires the exercise of significant judgement.
It will often be necessary to form a view on matters which are inherently uncertain, such as the scope of reviews required by regulators, the number of future complaints, the extent to which they will be upheld, the average cost of redress and the impact of legal decisions that may be relevant to claims received.
Consequently the continued appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence and adjustments made to the provisions where appropriate.
More detail on the nature of the assumptions that have been made and key sensitivities is set out below.

Payment protection insurance The Group increased the provision for PPI costs by a further 1,000 million in 2016, bringing the total amount provided to 17,025 million.
The charge to the provision in 2016 was largely driven by a higher total volume of complaints expected as a result of the Financial Conduct Authoritys FCA proposed industry deadline being extended to the end of June 2019 in its consultation paper published on 2 August 2016 CP16 20: Rules and guidance on payment protection insurance complaints: feedback on CP15 39 and further consultation.
The paper also consulted on some changes to the proposed rules and guidance that should apply when firms handle PPI complaints in light of the Supreme Courts decision in Plevin v Paragon Personal Finance Limited [2014] UKSC 61 Plevin.
In December 2016, the FCA stated that a further announcement in relation to the consultation would follow in 2017.
As at 31 December 2016, a provision of 2,258million remained unutilised relating to reactive complaints and associated administration costs.
Total cash payments were 2,200 million during the year to 31 December 2016.
Spend continues to reduce following the completion of the re-review of previously handled cases remediation.
The provision is consistent with total expected reactive complaint volumes of 4.9 million including complaints falling under the Plevin rules and guidance in light of the FCA proposals reflected in the provision increase, which was equivalent to approximately 7,700net complaints per week on average through to the proposed industry deadline of June 2019.
Weekly complaint levels in the second half of 2016 have been approximately 8,300 versus approximately 8,600 in the first half, and are expected to vary significantly through to the proposed industry deadline.
Sensitivities The Group estimates that it has sold approximately 16 million PPI policies since 2000.
These include policies that were not mis-sold and those that have been successfully claimed upon.
Since the commencement of the PPI redress programme in 2011 the Group estimates that it has contacted, settled or provided for approximately 50per cent of the policies sold since 2000.

The cost could differ from the Groups estimates and the assumptions underpinning them, and could result in The Finance Act 2016 was enacted on 15 September 2016.

For options granted on 27March 2014 under the Commercial Banking Transformation Plan CBTP, the number of options that may be delivered in March 2017 may vary by a factor of 0-4 from the original on-target award, depending on the degree to which the performance conditions have been met.
An on-target vesting is contingent upon Commercial Banking achieving 2.5billion underlying profit and 2per cent Return on Risk-weighted Assets RoRWA on 31December 2016.
The Plan will pay out at between 1.9billion and 3billion underlying profit, and between 1.6per cent and 2.5per cent RoRWA.
Participants are not entitled to any dividends paid during the vesting period.

Awards are made within limits set by the rules of the Plan, with the limits determining the maximum number of shares that can be awarded equating to three times annual salary.
In exceptional circumstances this may increase to four times annual salary.
Participants may be entitled to any dividends paid during the vesting period if the performance conditions are met.
An amount equal in value to any dividends paid between the award date and the date the Remuneration Committee determine that the performance conditions were met may be paid, based on the number of shares that vest.
The Remuneration Committee will determine if any dividends are to be paid in cash or in shares.
Details of the performance conditions for the plan are provided in the Directors remuneration report.
At the end of the performance period for the 2013 grant, the targets had not been fully met and therefore these awards vested in 2016 at a rate of 94.18percent.
The weighted average fair value of awards granted in the year was 0.64 2015: 0.78.

The expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of the closing daily share price over the most recent period that is commensurate with the expected life of the option.
The historical volatility is compared to the implied volatility generated from market traded options in the Groups shares to assess the reasonableness of the historical volatility and adjustments made where appropriate.
Matching shares The Group undertakes to match shares purchased by employees up to the value of 45 per month: these matching shares are held in trust for a mandatory period of three years on the employees behalf, during which period the employee is entitled to any dividends paid on such shares.
The award is subject to a non-market based condition: if an employee leaves within this three year period for other than a good reason, 100percent of the matching shares are forfeited.
Similarly if the employees sell their purchased shares within three years, their matching shares are forfeited.
The number of shares awarded relating to matching shares in 2016 was 35,956,224 2015: 18,001,413, with an average fair value of 0.61 2015:0.78, based on market prices at the date of award.
Fixed share awards Fixed share awards were introduced in 2014 in order to ensure that total fixed remuneration is commensurate with role and to provide a competitive reward package for certain Lloyds Banking Group employees, with an appropriate balance of fixed and variable remuneration, in line with regulatory requirements.
The fixed share awards are delivered in Lloyds Banking Group shares, released over five years with 20percent being released each year following the year of award.
The fixed share award is not subject to any performance conditions, performance adjustment or clawback.
On an employee leaving the Group, there is no change to the timeline for which shares will become unrestricted.

NOTE 48: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS Interchange fees With respect to multi-lateral interchange fees MIFs, the Group is not directly involved in the ongoing investigations and litigation as described below which involve card schemes such as Visa and MasterCard.
However, the Group is a member of Visa and MasterCard and other card schemes.
The European Commission continues to pursue certain competition investigations into MasterCard and Visa probing, amongst other things, MIFs paid in respect of cards issued outside the EEA: Litigation continues in the English Courts against both Visa and MasterCard.
This litigation has been brought by several retailers who are seeking damages for allegedly overpaid MIFs.
From publicly available information, it is understood these damages claims are running to different timescales with respect to the litigation process.
It is also possible that new claims may be issued.
Any ultimate impact on the Group of the above investigations and the litigation against Visa and MasterCard remains uncertain at this time.
Visa Inc completed its acquisition of Visa Europe on 21 June 2016.
The Groups share of the sale proceeds comprised cash consideration of approximately 330million of which approximately 300 million was received on completion of the sale and 30million is deferred for three years and preferred stock, which the Group measures at fair value.
The preferred stock is convertible into Class A Common Stock of Visa Inc or its equivalent upon the occurrence of certain events.
As part of this transaction, the Group and certain other UK banks also entered into a Loss Sharing Agreement LSA with Visa Inc, which clarifies the allocation of liabilities between the parties should the litigation referred to above result in Visa Inc being liable for damages payable by Visa Europe.
The maximum amount of liability to which the Group may be subject under the LSA is capped at the cash consideration which was received by the Group at completion.
Visa Inc may also have recourse to a general indemnity, currently in place under Visa Europes Operating Regulations, for damages claims concerning inter or intra-regional MIF setting activities.
LIBOR and other trading rates In July 2014, the Group announced that it had reached settlements totalling 217 million at 30 June 2014 exchange rates to resolve with UK and USfederal authorities legacy issues regarding the manipulation several years ago of Group companies submissions to the British Bankers Association BBA London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and Sterling Repo Rate.
The Group continues to cooperate with various other government and regulatory authorities, including the Serious Fraud Office, the Swiss Competition Commission, and a number of US State Attorneys General, in conjunction with their investigations into submissions made by panel members to the bodies that set LIBOR and various other interbank offered rates.
Certain Group companies, together with other panel banks, have also been named as defendants in private lawsuits, including purported class action suits, in the US in connection with their roles as panel banks contributing to the setting of US Dollar, Japanese Yen and Sterling LIBOR and the Australian BBSW Reference Rate.
The lawsuits, which contain broadly similar allegations, allege violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and the Commodity Exchange Act, as well as various state statutes and common law doctrines.
Certain of the plaintiffs claims, including those asserted under US anti-trust laws, were dismissed by the US Federal Court for Southern District of New York the District Court.
In November 2015 OTC and exchange-based plaintiffs claims against the Group were dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.
On 20December 2016, the Federal Court for Southern District of New York dismissed all antitrust class action claims against LBG and its affiliates in the Multi District Litigation arising from the alleged manipulation of USD LIBOR.
Further appeals in relation to the anti-trust claims remain possible.
Certain Group companies are also named as defendants in UK based claims raising LIBOR manipulation allegations in connection with interest rate hedging products.
It is currently not possible to predict the scope and ultimate outcome on the Group of the various outstanding regulatory investigations not encompassed by the settlements, any private lawsuits or any related challenges to the interpretation or validity of any of the Groups contractual arrangements, including their timing and scale.
242 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 48: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS continued UK shareholder litigation In August 2014, the Group and a number of former directors were named as defendants in a claim filed in the English High Court by a number of claimants who held shares in Lloyds TSB Group plc LTSB prior to the acquisition of HBOS plc, alleging breaches of duties in relation to information provided to shareholders in connection with the acquisition and the recapitalisation of LTSB.
It is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact on the Group if any, but the Group intends to defend the claim vigorously.
Financial Services Compensation Scheme The Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS is the UKs independent statutory compensation fund of last resort for customers of authorised financial services firms and pays compensation if a firm is unable or likely to be unable to pay claims against it.
The FSCS is funded by levies on the authorised financial services industry.
Each deposit-taking institution contributes towards the FSCS levies in proportion to their share of total protected deposits on 31 December of the year preceding the scheme year, which runs from 1 April to 31 March.
Following the default of a number of deposit takers in 2008, the FSCS borrowed funds from HM Treasury to meet the compensation costs for customers of those firms.
At 31 March 2016, the end of the latest FSCS scheme year for which it has published accounts, the principal balance outstanding on these loans was 15,655 million 31 March 2015: 15,797million.
Although it is anticipated that the substantial majority of this loan will be repaid from funds the FSCS receives from asset sales, surplus cash flow or other recoveries in relation to the assets of the firms that defaulted, any shortfall will be funded by deposit-taking participants of the FSCS.
The amount of future levies payable by the Group depends on a number of factors including the amounts recovered by the FSCS from asset sales, the Groups participation in the deposit-taking market at 31 December, the level of protected deposits and the population of deposit-taking participants.
Tax authorities The Group provides for potential tax liabilities that may arise on the basis of the amounts expected to be paid to tax authorities including open matters where Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC adopt a different interpretation and application of tax law.
The Group has an open matter in relation to a claim for group relief of losses incurred in its former Irish banking subsidiary, which ceased trading on 31 December 2010.
In 2013 HMRC informed the Group that their interpretation of the UK rules, permitting the offset of such losses, denies the claim: if HMRCs position is found to be correct management estimate that this would result in an increase in current tax liabilities of approximately 600million and a reduction in the Groups deferred tax asset of approximately 400 million.
The Group does not agree with HMRCs position and, having taken appropriate advice, does not consider that this is a case where additional tax will ultimately fall due.
There are a number of other open matters on which the Group is in discussion with HMRC including the tax treatment of certain costs arising from the divestment of TSB Banking Group plc : none of these is expected to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
Residential mortgage repossessions In August 2014, the Northern Ireland High Court handed down judgment in favour of the borrowers in relation to three residential mortgage test cases concerning certain aspects of the Groups practice with respect to the recalculation of contractual monthly instalments of customers in arrears.
The FCA is actively engaged with the industry in relation to these considerations.
The Group will respond as appropriate to this and any investigations, proceedings, or regulatory action that may in due course be instigated as a result of these issues.
The FCA has issued a consultation on new guidance on the treatment of customers with mortgage payment shortfalls.
The guidance covers remediation for mortgage customers who may have been affected by the way firms calculate these customers monthly mortgage instalments.
The output from this consultation is expected in the first quarter of 2017.
Update to the Financial Conduct Authoritys announcement in November 2015 on a deadline for PPI complaints and Plevin v Paragon Personal Finance Limited On 2 August 2016, the Financial Conduct Authority FCA published a further consultation paper CP16 20: Rules and guidance on payment protection insurance complaints: feedback on CP15 39 and further consultation, following on from the original consultation published in November 2015.
The FCA continues to propose the introduction of a two year deadline by which consumers would need to make their PPI complaintsand indicates the deadline period will start in June 2017 and end in June 2019, later than originally indicated by the FCA.
The FCA has also consulted further on changes to the proposed rules and guidance that should apply when firms handle PPI complaints in light of the Supreme Courts decision in Plevin v Paragon Personal Finance Limited [2014] UKSC 61.
The Group awaits the FCAs final decision.
A further announcement by the FCA is expected in 2017.
Mortgage arrears handling activities On 26 May 2016, the Group was informed that an enforcement team at the FCA had commenced an investigation in connection with the Groups mortgage arrears handling activities.
This investigation is ongoing and it is currently not possible to make a reliable assessment of the liability, if any, that may result from the investigation.
HBOS Reading customer review The Group is commencing a review into a number of customer cases from the former HBOS Impaired Assets Office based in Reading.
This review follows the conclusion of a criminal trial in which a number of individuals, including two former HBOS employees, were convicted of conspiracy to corrupt, fraudulent trading and associated money laundering offences which occurred prior to the acquisition of HBOS by the Group in 2009.
The review is at an early stage and it is currently not possible to determine the ultimate financial impact on the Group.
Other legal actions and regulatory matters In addition, during the ordinary course of business the Group is subject to other complaints and threatened or actual legal proceedings including class or group action claims brought by or on behalf of current or former employees, customers, investors or other third parties, as well as legal and regulatory reviews, challenges, investigations and enforcement actions, both in the UK and overseas.
All such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the Group incurring a liability.
In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established to managements best estimate of the amount required at the relevant balance sheet date.
In some cases it will not be possible to form a view, for example because the facts are unclear or because further time is needed properly to assess the merits of the case, and no provisions are held in relation to such matters.
However the Group does not currently expect the final outcome of any such case to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, operations or cash flows.

It is a measure as at a specific date and may be significantly different from the amount which will actually be paid or received on maturity or settlement date.
Wherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments held by the Group.
Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use nonmarket observable inputs.
Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models and, where appropriate, comparison to instruments with characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group.
The Group manages valuation adjustments for its derivative exposures on a net basis: the Group determines their fair values on the basis of their net exposures.
In all other cases, fair values of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are determined on the basis of their gross exposures.
The carrying amount of the following financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of fair value: cash and balances at central banks, items in the course of collection from banks, items in course of transmission to banks, notes in circulation and liabilities arising from nonparticipating investmentcontracts.
Because a variety of estimation techniques are employed and significant estimates made, comparisons of fair values between financial institutions may not be meaningful.
Readers of these financial statements are thus advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups financialposition.
Fair value information is not provided for items that are not financial instruments or for other assets and liabilities which are not carried at fair value in the Groups consolidated balance sheet.
These items include intangible assets, such as the value of the Groups branch network, the longterm relationships with depositors and credit card relationships: premises and equipment: and shareholders equity.
These items are material and accordingly the Group believes that the fair value information presented does not represent the underlying value of the Group.
Valuation control framework The key elements of the control framework for the valuation of financial instruments include model validation, product implementation review and independent price verification.
These functions are carried out by appropriately skilled risk and finance teams, independent of the business area responsible for the products.
Model validation covers both qualitative and quantitative elements relating to new models.
In respect of new products, a product implementation review is conducted pre and posttrading.
Pretrade testing ensures that the new model is integrated into the Groups systems and that the profit and loss and risk reporting are consistent throughout the trade life cycle.
Posttrade testing examines the explanatory power of the implemented model, actively monitoring model parameters and comparing inhouse pricing to external sources.
Independent price verification procedures cover financial instruments carried at fair value.
The frequency of the review is matched to the availability of independent data, monthly being the minimum.
Valuation differences in breach of established thresholds are escalated to senior management.
The results from independent pricing and valuation reserves are reviewed monthly by senior management.
Formal committees, consisting of senior risk, finance and business management, meet at least quarterly to discuss and approve valuations in more judgemental areas, in particular for unquoted equities, structured credit, overthecounter options and the Credit Valuation Adjustment CVA reserve.
Valuation of financial assets and liabilities Assets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels according to the quality and reliability of information used to determine the fair values.
Level 1 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Products classified as level 1 predominantly comprise equity shares, treasury bills and other government securities.
Level 2 Level 2 valuations are those where quoted market prices are not available, for example where the instrument is traded in a market that is not considered to be active or valuation techniques are used to determine fair value and where these techniques use inputs that are based significantly on observable market data.
Examples of such financial instruments include most overthecounter derivatives, financial institution issued securities, certificates of deposit and certain assetbacked securities.
Level 3 Level 3 portfolios are those where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Such instruments would include the Groups venture capital and unlisted equity investments which are valued using various valuation techniques that require significant management judgement in determining appropriate assumptions, including earnings multiples and estimated future cash flows.
Certain of the Groups assetbacked securities and derivatives, principally where there is no trading activity in such securities, are also classified as level 3.
Transfers out of the level 3 portfolio arise when inputs that could have a significant impact on the instruments valuation become market observable after previously having been nonmarket observable.
In the case of assetbacked securities this can arise if more than one consistent independent source of data becomes available.
Conversely transfers into the portfolio arise when consistent sources of data cease to be available.
247 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued NOTE 49: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued 3 Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value Critical accounting estimates and judgments The valuation techniques for level 2 and, particularly, level 3 financial instruments involve management judgement and estimates the extent of which depends on the complexity of the instrument and the availability of market observable information.
In addition, in line with market practice, the Group applies credit, debit and funding valuation adjustments in determining the fair value of its uncollateralised derivative positions.
A description of these adjustments is set out in this note on page 253.
Further details of the Groups level 3 financial instruments and the sensitivity of their valuation including the effect of applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions in determining their fair value are set out below.
Details about sensitivities to market risk arising from trading assets and other treasury positions can be found in the Risk Management section on page 146.

The fair value of these assets is determined using discounted cash flow techniques.
The discount rates are derived from observable repo curves specific to the type of security purchased under the reverse repurchase agreement.
Debt securities Debt securities measured at fair value and classified as level2 are valued by discounting expected cash flows using an observable credit spread applicable to the particular instrument.
Where there is limited trading activity in debt securities, the Group uses valuation models, consensus pricing information from third party pricing services and broker or lead manager quotes to determine an appropriate valuation.
Debt securities are classified as level 3 if there is a significant valuation input that cannot be corroborated through market sources or where there are materially inconsistent values for an input.
Asset classes classified as level 3 mainly comprise certain collateralised loan obligations and collateralised debt obligations.
Equity investments Unlisted equity and fund investments are valued using different techniques in accordance with the Groups valuation policy and International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines.
Depending on the business sector and the circumstances of the investment, unlisted equity valuations are based on earnings multiples, net asset values or discounted cash flows.
A number of earnings multiples are used in valuing the portfolio including price earnings, earnings before interest and tax and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
The particular multiple selected being appropriate for the type of business being valued and is derived by reference to the current market-based multiple.
Consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing ofcomparable businesses when selecting an appropriate multiple.
Discounted cash flow valuations use estimated future cash flows, usually based on management forecasts, with the application of appropriate exit yields or terminal multiples and discounted using rates appropriate to the specific investment, business sector or recent economic rates of return.
Recent transactions involving the sale of similar businesses may sometimes be used as a frame of reference in deriving an appropriate multiple.
For fund investments the most recent capital account value calculated by the fund manager is used as the basis for the valuation and adjusted, ifnecessary, to align valuation techniques with the Groups valuation policy.
Unlisted equity investments and investments in property partnerships held in the life assurance funds are valued using thirdparty valuations.
Management take account of any pertinent information, such asrecent transactions and information received on particular investments, to adjust the third party valuations where necessary.

The types of derivatives classified as level 2 and the valuation techniques used include: Interest rate swaps which are valued using discounted cash flow models: the most significant inputs into those models are interest rate yield curves which are developed from publicly quoted rates.
Foreign exchange derivatives that do not contain options which are priced using rates available from publicly quoted sources.
Credit derivatives which are valued using standard models with observable inputs, except for the items classified as level 3, which are valued using publicly available yield and credit default swap CDS curves.
Less complex interest rate and foreign exchange option products which are valued using volatility surfaces developed from publicly available interest rate cap, interest rate swaption and other option volatilities: option volatility skew information is derived from a market standard consensus pricing service.
For more complex option products, the Group calibrates its models using observable at-the-money data: where necessary, the Group adjusts for out-of-the-money positions using a market standard consensus pricing service.
Complex interest rate and foreign exchange products where there is significant dispersion of consensus pricing or where implied funding costs are material and unobservable are classified as level 3.
Where credit protection, usually in the form of credit default swaps, has been purchased or written on asset-backed securities, the security is referred to as a negative basis asset-backed security and the resulting derivative assets or liabilities have been classified as either level 2 or level 3 according to the classification of the underlying asset-backed security.

i Uncollateralised derivative valuation adjustments, excluding monoline counterparties The following table summarises the movement on this valuation adjustment account during 2015 and 2016: 2016 2015 m m At 1 January 598 608 Income statement charge credit 163 38 Transfers 17 28 At 31 December 744 598 Represented by: 2016 2015 m m Credit Valuation Adjustment 685 511 Debit Valuation Adjustment 123 78 Funding Valuation Adjustment 182 165 744 598 Credit and Debit Valuation Adjustments CVA and DVA are applied to the Groups over-the-counter derivative exposures with counterparties that are not subject to standard interbank collateral arrangements.
These exposures largely relate to the provision of risk management solutions for corporate customers within the Commercial Banking division.
A CVA is taken where the Group has a positive future uncollateralised exposure asset.
A DVA is taken where the Group has a negative future uncollateralised exposure liability.
These adjustments reflect interest rates and expectations of counterparty creditworthiness and the Groups own credit spread respectively.
The CVA is sensitive to: the current size of the mark-to-market position on the uncollateralised asset: expectations of future market volatility of the underlying asset: and expectations of counterparty creditworthiness.
In circumstances where exposures to a counterparty become impaired, any associated derivative valuation adjustment is transferred and assessed for specific loss alongside other non-derivative assets and liabilities that the counterparty may have with the Group.
Market Credit Default Swap CDS spreads are used to develop the probability of default for quoted counterparties.
For unquoted counterparties, internal credit ratings and market sector CDS curves and recovery rates are used.
The Loss Given Default LGD is based on market recovery rates and internal credit assessments.
The combination of a one notch deterioration in the credit rating of derivative counterparties and a tenpercent increase in LGD increases the CVA by 64million.
Current market value is used to estimate the projected exposure for products not supported by the model, which are principally complex interest rate options that are traded in very low volumes.
For these, the CVA is calculated on an add-on basis in total contributing 1million of the overall CVA balance at 31 December 2016.
The DVA is sensitive to: the current size of the mark-to-market position on the uncollateralised liability: expectations of future market volatility of the underlying liability: and the Groups own CDS spread.
A onepercent rise in the CDS spread would lead to an increase in the DVA of 152million to 275million.
The risk exposures that are used for the CVA and DVA calculations are strongly influenced by interest rates.
Due to the nature of the Groups business the CVA DVA exposures tend to be on average the same way around such that the valuation adjustments fall when interest rates rise.
Aonepercent rise in interest rates would lead to a 221million fall in the overall valuation adjustment to 341million.
The CVA model used by theGroup does not assume any correlation between the level of interest rates and default rates.
The Group has also recognised a Funding Valuation Adjustment to adjust for the net cost of funding uncollateralised derivative positions.
This adjustment is calculated on the expected future exposure discounted at a suitable cost of funds.
A ten basis points increase in the cost of funds willincrease the funding valuation adjustment by approximately 32million.
ii Market liquidity The Group includes mid to bid-offer valuation adjustments against the expected cost of closing out the net market risk in the Groups trading positions within a timeframe that is consistent with historical trading activity and spreads that the trading desks have accessed historically during the ordinary course of business in normal market conditions.
At 31December2016, the Groups derivative trading business held mid to bid-offer valuation adjustments of 96million 2015: 76million.

254 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 49: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Unobservable inputs Significant unobservable inputs affecting the valuation of debt securities, unlisted equity investments and derivatives are as follows: Interest rates and inflation rates are referenced in some derivatives where the payoff that the holder of the derivative receives depends on the behaviour of those underlying references through time.
Credit spreads represent the premium above the benchmark reference instrument required to compensate for lower credit quality: higher spreads lead to a lower fair value.
Volatility parameters represent key attributes of option behaviour: higher volatilities typically denote a wider range of possible outcomes.
Earnings multiples are used to value certain unlisted equity investments: a higher earnings multiple will result in a higher fair value.
Reasonably possible alternative assumptions Valuation techniques applied to many of the Groups level 3 instruments often involve the use of two or more inputs whose relationship is interdependent.
The calculation of the effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions included in the table above reflects such relationships.
Debt securities Reasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of the Groups structured credit investment by flexing creditspreads.
Derivatives Reasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of swaptions in the Groups derivative portfolios which are priced using industry standard option pricing models.
Such models require interest rate volatilities which may be unobservable at longer maturities.
To derive reasonably possible alternative valuations these volatilities have been flexed within a range of nilpercent to 115percent 2015: 1percent and 63percent.
Unlisted equity, venture capital investments and investments in property partnerships The valuation techniques used for unlisted equity and venture capital investments vary depending on the nature of the investment.
Reasonably possible alternative valuations for these investments have been calculated by reference to the approach taken, as appropriate to the business sector and investment circumstances and as such the following inputs have been considered: for valuations derived from earnings multiples, consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing of comparable businesses when selecting an appropriate multiple: the discount rates used in discounted cash flow valuations: and in line with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines, the values of underlying investments in fund investments portfolios.

The carrying value of the variable rate loans and those relating to lease financing is assumed to be their fair value.
To determine the fair value of loans and advances to customers, loans are segregated into portfolios of similar characteristics.
A number of techniques are used to estimate the fair value of fixed rate lending: these take account of expected credit losses based on historic trends, prevailing market interest rates and expected future cash flows.
For retail exposures, fair value is usually estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows including interest at contractual rates at market rates for similar loans offered by the Group and other financial institutions.
Certain loans secured on residential properties are made at a fixed rate for a limited period, typically two to five years, after which the loans revert to the relevant variable rate.
The fair value of such loans is estimated by reference to the market rates for similar loans of maturity equal to the remaining fixed interest rate period.
The fair value of commercial loans is estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows at a rate which reflects the effects of interest rate changes, adjusted for changes incredit risk.
No adjustment is made to put it in place by the Group to manage its interest rate exposure.
Loans and advances to banks The carrying value of short dated loans and advances to banks is assumed to be their fair value.
The fair value of loans and advances to banks is estimated by discounting the anticipated cash flows at a market discount rate adjusted for the credit spread of the obligor or, where not observable, the credit spread of borrowers of similar credit quality.
Debt securities The fair values of debt securities, which were previously within assets held for trading and were reclassified to loans and receivables, are determined predominantly from lead manager quotes and, where these are not available, by alternative techniques including reference to credit spreads on similar assets with the same obligor, market standard consensus pricing services, broker quotes and other research data.
Reverse repurchase agreements The carrying amount is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value given the short-term nature of these instruments.

The fair value for all other deposits is estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market rates, where applicable, or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
Debt securities in issue The fair value of short-term debt securities in issue is approximately equal to their carrying value.
Fair value for other debt securities is calculated based on quoted market prices where available.
Where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow techniques at a rate which reflects market rates of interest and the Groups own credit spread.
Subordinated liabilities The fair value of subordinated liabilities is determined by reference to quoted market prices where available or by reference to quoted market prices of similar instruments.
Subordinated liabilities are classified as level 2, since the inputs used to determine their fair value are largely observable.
Repurchase agreements The carrying amount is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value given the short term nature of these instruments.
5 Reclassifications of financial assets In 2015 the Group had reviewed its approach to managing a portfolio of government securities held as a separately identifiable component of the Groups liquidity portfolio.
Given the long-term nature of this portfolio, and reflecting the Groups positive intent and ability to hold them until maturity in the economic environment at the time, the Group concluded that certain of these securities would be able to be held until they reached maturity and consequently, on 1 May 2015, government securities with a fair value of 19,938 million were reclassified from available-for-sale financial assets to held-to-maturity investments.
During 2016, the Group has reassessed this holding of government securities classified as held-to-maturity in light of the current low interest rate environment and they have been reclassified as available-for-sale: this resulted in a credit of 1,544 million to the available-forsale revaluation reserve 1,127 million after tax.
257 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued NOTE 50: TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS There were no significant transferred financial assets which were derecognised in their entirety, but with ongoing exposure.
Details of transferred financial assets that continue to be recognised in full are as follows.
The Group enters into repurchase and securities lending transactions in the normal course of business that do not result in derecognition of the financial assets covered as substantially all of the risks and rewards, including credit, interest rate, prepayment and other price risks are retained by the Group.
In all cases, the transferee has the right to sell or repledge the assets concerned.
As set out in note 19, included within loans and receivables are loans transferred under the Groups securitisation and covered bond programmes.
As the Group retains all of a majority of the risks and rewards associated with these loans, including credit, interest rate, prepayment and liquidity risk, they remain on the Groups balance sheet.
Assets transferred into the Groups securitisation and covered bond programmes are not available to be used by the Group whilst the assets are within the programmes.
However, the Group retains the right to remove loans from the covered bond programmes where they are in excess of the programmes requirements.
In addition, where the Group has retained some of the notes issued by securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group has the ability to sell or pledge these retainednotes.
The table below sets out the carrying values of the transferred assets and the associated liabilities.
For repurchase and securities lending transactions, the associated liabilities represent the Groups obligation to repurchase the transferred assets.
For securitisation programmes, the associated liabilities represent the external notes in issue note 31.
Except as otherwise noted below, none of the liabilities shown in the table below have recourse only to the transferred assets.

The Group holds and provides cash and securities collateral in respective of derivative transactions covered by these agreements.
The right to set off balances under these master netting agreements or to set off cash and securities collateral only arises in the event of non-payment or default and, as a result, these arrangements do not qualify for offsetting under IAS32.

260 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 52: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT As a bancassurer, financial instruments are fundamental to the Groups activities and, as a consequence, the risks associated with financial instruments represent a significant component of the risks faced by theGroup.
The primary risks affecting the Group through its use of financial instruments are: credit risk: market risk, which includes interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk: liquidity risk: capital risk: and insurance risk.
Information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks and capital can be found on pages 115 to 169.
The following additional disclosures, which provide quantitative information about the risks within financial instruments held or issued by the Group, should be read in conjunction with that earlier information.
Market risk Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from the different repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities.
Liabilities are either insensitive to interest rate movements, for example interest free or very low interest customer deposits, or are sensitive to interest rate changes but bear rates which may be varied at the Groups discretion and that for competitive reasons generally reflect changes in the Bank of Englands base rate.
The rates on the remaining deposits are contractually fixed for their term to maturity.
Many banking assets are sensitive to interest rate movements: there is a large volume of managed rate assets such as variable rate mortgages which may be considered as a natural offset to the interest rate risk arising from the managed rate liabilities.
However, a significant proportion ofthe Groups lending assets, for example many personal loans and mortgages, bear interest rates which are contractually fixed.
The Group establishes two types of hedge accounting relationships for interest rate risk: fair value hedges and cash flow hedges.
The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate customer loans, its fixed rate customer deposits and the majority of its subordinated debt, and to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and deposits together with its floating rate subordinated debt.
At 31December 2016 the aggregate notional principal of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges was 194,416million 2015:121,063million with a net fair value asset of 725million 2015: asset of 848million note 16.
The losses on the hedging instruments were 1,946million 2015:losses of 618million.
The gains on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were 2,017million 2015:gains of 511million.
In addition the Group has cash flow hedges which are primarily used to hedge the variability in the cost of funding within the commercial business.
Note16 shows when the hedged cash flows are expected to occur and when they will affect income for designated cashflow hedges.
The notional principal of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges at 31December 2016 was 384,182million 2015:460,829million with a net fair value liability of 352million 2015: liability of 718million note16.
In 2016, ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement that arises from cash flow hedges was a gain of 24million 2015: gain of 3million.
Currency risk The corporate and retail businesses incur foreign exchange risk in the course of providing services to their customers.
All non-structural foreign exchange exposures in the non-trading book are transferred to the trading area where they are monitored and controlled.
These risks reside in the authorised trading centres who are allocated exposure limits.
The limits are monitored daily by the local centres and reported to the market and liquidity risk function in London.
Associated VaR and the closing, average, maximum and minimum are disclosed on page 151.
Risk arises from the Groups investments in its overseas operations.
The Groups structural foreign currency exposure is represented by the net asset value of the foreign currency equity and subordinated debt investments in its subsidiaries and branches.
Gains or losses on structural foreign currency exposures are taken to reserves.
The Group hedges part of the currency translation risk of the net investment in certain foreign operations using currency borrowings.
At 31December2016 the aggregate principal of these currency borrowings was 695million 2015: 670million.
In 2016, an ineffectiveness loss of 2million before tax and 1million after tax 2015: ineffectiveness gain of 5million before tax and 4million after tax was recognised in the income statement arising from netinvestment hedges.
The Groups main overseas operations are in the Americas and Europe.
Details of the Groups structural foreign currency exposures, after net investment hedges, are as follows: Functional currency of Group operations 2016 2015 Other nonOther nonEuro US Dollar sterling Euro US Dollar sterling m m m m m m Gross exposure 247 479 36 246 447 32 Net investment hedges 216 479 254 415 1 Total structural foreign currency exposures, after net investment hedges 31 36 8 32 31 261 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued NOTE 52: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Credit risk The Groups credit risk exposure arises in respect of the instruments below and predominantly in the United Kingdom.
Information about the Groups exposure to credit risk, credit risk management, measurement and mitigation can be found on pages 124 to 144.
Maximum credit exposure The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations is detailed below.
No account is taken of any collateral held and the maximum exposure to loss, which includes amounts held to cover unit-linked and With Profits funds liabilities, is considered to be the balance sheet carrying amount or, for non-derivative off-balance sheet transactions and financial guarantees, their contractual nominal amounts.
2 Offset items comprise deposit amounts available for offset, and amounts available for offset under master netting arrangements, that do not meet the criteria under IAS 32 to enable loans and advances and derivative assets respectively to be presented net of these balances in the financial statements.
4 Includes assets within the Groups unit-linked funds for which credit risk is borne by the policyholders and assets within the Groups With-Profits funds for which credit risk is largely borne by the policyholders.
Consequently, the Group has no significant exposure to credit risk for such assets which back related contract liabilities.
Concentrations of exposure The Groups management of concentration risk includes single name, industry sector and country limits as well as controls over the Groups overall exposure to certain products.
Further information on the Groups management of this risk is included within Credit risk mitigation, Risk management on page 124.
At 31 December 2016 the most significant concentrations of exposure were in mortgages comprising 67percent of total loans and advances to customers and to financial, business and other services comprising 11percent of the total.
For further information on concentrations of the Groups loans, refer to note 18.
Following the continuing reduction in the Groups non-UK activities, an analysis of credit risk exposures by geographical region has not been provided.
262 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 52: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued C. Credit quality of assets Loans and receivables The disclosures in the table below and those on page 264 are produced under the underlying basis used for the Groups segmental reporting.
The Group believes that, for reporting periods following a significant acquisition such as the acquisition of HBOS in 2009, this underlying basis, which includes the allowance for loan losses at the acquisition date on a gross basis, more fairly reflects the underlying provisioning status of the loans.
The remaining acquisition-related fair value adjustments in respect of this lending are therefore identified separately in this table.
The analysis of lending between retail and commercial has been prepared based upon the type of exposure and not the business segment in which the exposure is recorded.
Included within retail are exposures to personal customers and small businesses, whilst included within commercial are exposures to corporate customers and other large institutions.

Commercial lending has been classified using internal probability of default rating models mapped so that they are comparable to external credit ratings.
Good quality lending comprises the lower assessed default probabilities, with other classifications reflecting progressively higher default risk.
Classifications of retail lending incorporate expected recovery levels for mortgages, as well as probabilities of default assessed using internal rating models.
Further information about the Groups internal probabilities of default rating models can be found on page 124.

Credit risk in respect of trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss held within the Groups unit-linked funds is borne by the policyholders and credit risk in respect of with-profits funds is largely borne by the policyholders.
Consequently, the Group has no significant exposure to credit risk for such assets which back those contract liabilities.
266 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 52: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Derivative assets An analysis of derivative assets is given in note16.
The Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities.
In respect of the Groups net credit risk relating to derivative assets of 17,599million 2015:10,001million, cash collateral of 6,472million 2015:3,228million was held and a further 613million was due from OECD banks 2015:94million.
2 Other comprises sub-investment grade 2016: 1,830million: 2015: 1,418 million and not rated 2016: 271million: 2015: 632 million.
Financial guarantees and irrevocable loan commitments Financial guarantees represent undertakings that the Group will meet a customers obligation to third parties if the customer fails to do so.
Commitments to extend credit represent unused portions of authorisations to extend credit in the form of loans, guarantees or letters of credit.
The Group is theoretically exposed to loss in an amount equal to the total guarantees or unused commitments, however, the likely amount of loss is expected to be significantly less: most commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards.
D. Collateral held as security for financial assets A general description of collateral held as security in respect of financial instruments is provided on page 126.
The Group holds collateral against loans and receivables and irrevocable loan commitments: qualitative and, where appropriate, quantitative information is provided in respect of this collateral below.
Collateral held as security for trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and for derivative assets is also shown below.
Loans and receivables The disclosures below are produced under the underlying basis used for the Groups segmental reporting.
The Group believes that, for reporting periods following a significant acquisition, such as the acquisition of HBOS in 2009, this underlying basis, which includes the allowance for loan losses at the acquisition on a gross basis, more fairly reflects the underlying provisioning status of the loans.
The Group holds collateral in respect of loans and advances to banks and customers as set out below.
The Group does not hold collateral against debt securities, comprising asset-backed securities and corporate and other debt securities, which are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and advances to banks There were reverse repurchase agreements which are accounted for as collateralised loans within loans and advances to banks with a carrying valueof 902million 2015:963million, against which the Group held collateral with a fair value of 785million 2015:1,009million.
These transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard secured lending activities.
Loans and advances to customers Retail lending Mortgages An analysis by loan-to-value ratio of the Groups residential mortgage lending is provided below.
The value of collateral used in determining the loan-to-value ratios has been estimated based upon the last actual valuation, adjusted to take into account subsequent movements in house prices, after making allowance for indexation error and dilapidations.
At 31 December 2016, impaired non-mortgage lending amounted to 972million, net of an impairment allowance of 458million 2015: 1,153million, net of an impairment allowance of 448million.
The fair value of the collateral held in respect of this lending was 139million 2015: 107million.
In determining the fair value of collateral, no specific amounts have been attributed to the costs of realisation and the value of collateral for each loan has been limited to the principal amount of the outstanding advance in order to eliminate the effects of  and to provide a clearer representation of the Groups exposure.
Unimpaired non-mortgage retail lending amounted to 39,864million 2015: 39,279million.
Lending decisions are predominantly based on an obligors ability to repay from normal business operations rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided.
Collateral values are rigorously assessed at the time of loan origination and are thereafter monitored in accordance with business unit credit policy.
The Group credit risk disclosures for unimpaired non-mortgage retail lending report assets gross of collateral and therefore disclose the maximum loss exposure.
The Group believes that this approach is appropriate.
The value of collateral is reassessed if there is observable evidence of distress of the borrower.
Unimpaired non-mortgage retail lending, including any associated collateral, is managed on a customer-by-customer basis rather than a portfolio basis.
No aggregated collateral information for the entire unimpaired non-mortgage retail lending portfolio is provided to key managementpersonnel.
Commercial lending Reverse repurchase transactions At 31 December 2016 there were reverse repurchase agreements which were accounted for as collateralised loans with a carrying value of 8,304million 2015: nil, against which the Group held collateral with a fair value of 7,490million 2015: nil, all of which the Group was able to repledge.
Included in these amounts were collateral balances in the form of cash provided in respect of reverse repurchase agreements of 8million 2015: nil.
Impaired secured lending The value of collateral is re-evaluated and its legal soundness re-assessed if there is observable evidence of distress of the borrower: this evaluation is used to determine potential loss allowances and managements strategy to try to either repair the business or recover the debt.
At 31 December 2016, impaired secured commercial lending amounted to 204million, net of an impairment allowance of 401million 2015:1,245million, net of an impairment allowance of 577million.
The fair value of the collateral held in respect of impaired secured commercial lending was 1,160million 2015:1,367million.
In determining the fair value of collateral, no specific amounts have been attributed to the costs of realisation.
For the purposes of determining the total collateral held by the Group in respect of impaired secured commercial lending, the value of collateral for each loan has been limited to the principal amount of the outstanding advance in order to eliminate the effects of any  and to provide a clearer representation of the Groups exposure.
Impaired secured commercial lending and associated collateral relates to lending to property companies and to customers in the financial, business and other services: transport, distribution and hotels: and construction industries.
Unimpaired secured lending Unimpaired secured commercial lending amounted to 36,275million 2015:51,298million.
For unimpaired secured commercial lending, the Group reports assets gross of collateral and therefore discloses the maximum loss exposure.
The Group believes that this approach is appropriate as collateral values at origination and during a period of good performance may not be representative of the value of collateral if the obligor enters a distressed state.
Unimpaired secured commercial lending is predominantly managed on a cash flow basis.
On occasion, it may include an assessment of underlying collateral, although, for impaired lending, this will not always involve assessing it on a fair value basis.
No aggregated collateral information for the entire unimpaired secured commercial lending portfolio is provided to key management personnel.
Trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss excluding equity shares Included in trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are reverse repurchase agreements treated as collateralised loans with a carrying value of 33,079million 2015:33,174million.
Collateral is held with a fair value of 30,850million 2015:36,493million, all of which the Group is able to repledge.
In addition, securities held as collateral in the form of stock borrowed amounted to 47,816million 2015:58,621million.
Of this amount, 16,204million 2015:29,859million had been resold or repledged as collateral for the Groups own transactions.
Derivative assets, after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements The Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquidsecurities.
In respect of the net derivative assets after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements of 17,599million 2015:10,001million, cash collateral of 6,472million 2015:3,228million was held.
Irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies At 31 December 2016, the Group held irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies of 66,240million 2015: 65,719million.
Collateral is held as security, in the event that lending is drawn down, on 10,053million 2015:9,551million of these balances.
Collateral repossessed During the year, 241million of collateral was repossessed 2015: 203million, consisting primarily of residential property.
In respect of retail portfolios, the Group does not take physical possession of properties or other assets held as collateral and uses external agents to realise the value as soon as practicable, generally at auction, to settle indebtedness.
Any surplus funds are returned to the borrower or are otherwise dealt with in accordance with appropriate insolvency regulations.
In certain circumstances the Group takes physical possession of assets held as collateral against commercial lending.
In such cases, the assets are carried on the Groups balance sheet and are classified according to the Groups accounting policies.
268 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 52: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued E. Collateral pledged as security The Group pledges assets primarily for repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions which are generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard securitised borrowing contracts.
Repurchase transactions Deposits from banks Included in deposits from banks are deposits held as collateral for facilities granted, with a carrying value of 7,279million 2015: 7,061million and a fair value of 8,395million 2015: 6,707million.
Customer deposits Customer deposits included deposits held as collateral for facilities granted with a carrying value of 2,462 million 2015:nil and a fair value of 2,277million 2015: nil.
No collateral balances in the form of cash were provided in respect of repurchase agreements 2015:5million.
Trading and other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss The fair value of collateral pledged in respect of repurchase transactions, accounted for as secured borrowing, where the secured party is permitted by contract or custom to repledge was 45,702million 2015: 44,655million.
Securities lending transactions The following on balance sheet financial assets have been lent to counterparties under securities lending transactions: 2016 2015 m m Trading and other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 6,991 6,478 Loans and advances to customers 583 1,491 Available-for-sale financial assets 3,206 4,247 10,780 12,216 Securitisations and covered bonds In addition to the assets detailed above, the Group also holds assets that are encumbered through the Groups asset-backed conduits and its securitisation and covered bond programmes.
Further details of these assets are provided in notes 19 and 20.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group has insufficient financial resources to meet its commitments as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost.
Liquidity risk is managed through a series of measures, tests and reports that are primarily based on contractual maturity.
The Group carries out monthly stress testing of its liquidity position against a range of scenarios, including those prescribed by the PRA.
The Groups liquidity risk appetite is also calibrated against a number of stressed liquidity metrics.
269 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued NOTE 52: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued The table below analyses assets and liabilities of the Group into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining contractual period at the balance sheet date: balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category.
Certain balances, included in the table below on the basis of their residual maturity, are repayable on demand upon payment of a penalty.
The Groups assets and liabilities may be repaid or otherwise mature earlier or later than implied by their contractual terms and readers are, therefore, advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups liquidity position.
In particular, amounts in respect of customer deposits are usually contractually payable on demand or at short notice.
However, in practice, these deposits are not usually withdrawn on their contractual maturity.
270 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 52: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued The table below analyses financial instrument liabilities of the Group, excluding those arising from insurance and participating investment contracts, on an undiscounted future cash flow basis according to contractual maturity, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date: balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category.
The majority ofthe Groups financial guarantee contracts are callable on demand, were the guaranteed party to fail to meet its obligations.
It is, however, expected that most guarantees will expire unused.
The contractual nominal amounts of these guarantees totalled 6,883million at 31December 2016 2015: 7,165million with 3,815million expiring within one year: 667million between one and three years: 1,334million between three and five years: and 1,067million over five years 2015: 4,014million expiring within one year: 942million between one and three years: 1,182million between three and five years: and 1,027million over five years.
The majority of the Groups non-participating investment contract liabilities are unit-linked.
These unit-linked products are invested in accordance with unit fund mandates.
Clauses are included in policyholder contracts to permit the deferral of sales, where necessary, so that linked assets can be realised without being a forced seller.
The principal amount for undated subordinated liabilities with no redemption option is included within the over five years column: interest of approximately 23million 2015: 39million per annum which is payable in respect of those instruments for as long as they remain in issue is not included beyond five years.
271 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financialstatements continued NOTE 52: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Further information on the Groups liquidity exposures is provided on pages 154 to 157.

274 Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTE 55: FUTURE ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS The following pronouncements are not applicable for the year ending 31 December 2016 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements.
Save as disclosed below, the impact of these accounting changes is still being assessed by the Group and reliable estimates cannot be made at this stage.
With the exception of IFRS 9, which was endorsed in November 2016, as at 21 February 2017 these pronouncements are awaiting EU endorsement.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
Classification and Measurement IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into one of three measurement categories, fair value through profit or loss, fair value through other comprehensive income or amortised cost.
Financial assets will be measured at amortised cost if they are held within a business model the objective of which is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and their contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.
Financial assets will be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if they are held within a business model the objective of which is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and their contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.
Financial assets not meeting either of these two business models: and all equity instruments unless designated at inception to fair value through other comprehensive income : and all derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
An entity may, at initial recognition, designate a financial asset as measured at fair value through profit or loss if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch.
The Group has undertaken an assessment to determine the potential impact of changes in classification and measurement of financial assets.
The adoption of IFRS 9 is unlikely to result in significant changes to existing asset measurement bases, however, the final impact will be dependent on the facts and circumstances that exist on 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 retains most of the existing requirements for financial liabilities.
However, for financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, gains or losses attributable to changes in own credit risk may be presented in other comprehensive income.
It is expected that the Group will elect to early adopt this presentation of gains and losses on financial liabilities from 1 January 2017.
These gains and losses are currently recognised in profitor loss and are disclosed in note 30 to the financial statements.
Impairment Overview The IFRS 9 impairment model will be applicable to all financial assets at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, lease receivables, loan commitments and financial guarantees not measured at fair value through profit or loss.
IFRS 9 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment approach with an Expected Credit Loss ECL model, resulting in earlier recognition of credit losses compared with IAS 39.
Expected credit losses are the unbiased probability weighted average credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes and future economic conditions.
The ECL model has three stages.
Entities are required to recognise a 12 month expected loss allowance on initial recognition stage 1 and a lifetime expected loss allowance when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition stage 2.
Stage 3 requires objective evidence that an asset is credit-impaired, which is similar to the guidance on incurred losses in IAS 39.
Under IAS 39, provisions are recognised for losses that have been incurred but may not have been separately identified.
The Group has a range of emergence periods which are dependent upon the characteristics of the portfolios, but typically range between one month and twelve months based on historical experience.
Unsecured portfolios tend to have shorter emergence periods than secured portfolios.
Under IFRS 9, all loans in stage 1 will require a loss allowance measured at an amount equal to 12 months ECL and is therefore longer than current emergence periods for certain portfolios.
The requirement to recognise lifetime ECL for loans which have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since origination, but which are not credit impaired, does not exist under IAS 39.
The assessment of whether an asset is in stage 1 or 2 considers the relative change in the probability of default occurring over the expected life of the instrument, not the change in the amount of expected credit losses.
This will involve setting quantitative tests combined with supplementary indicators such as credit risk classification.
Reasonable and supportable forward looking information will also be used in determining the stage allocation.
In general, assets more than 30 days past due, but not credit impaired, will be classed as stage 2.
IFRS 9 requires the use of more forward looking information including reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.
The need to consider a range of economic scenarios and how they could impact the loss allowance is a subjective feature of the IFRS 9 ECL model.
The Group is developing the capability to model a number of economic scenarios and capture the impact on credit losses to ensure the overall ECL represents a reasonable distribution of economic outcomes.
Appropriate governance and oversight will be established around the process.
IFRS 9 Impairment Models For all material portfolios, IFRS 9 ECL calculation will leverage the systems, data and methodology used to calculate regulatory expected losses.
The Group anticipates the definition of default for IFRS 9 purposes will be aligned to the Basel definition of default to ensure consistency across the Group.
However, the IFRS 9 ECL models differ from the regulatory models in a number of ways, for example stage 2 assets under IFRS 9 carry a lifetime expected loss amount whereas regulatory models generate 12 month expected losses for non-defaulted loans.
IFRS 9 models will use three key input parameters for the computation of expected loss, being probability of default PD, loss given default LGD and exposure at default EAD.
However, given the conservatism inherent in the regulatory expected losses calculation, some adjustments to these components must be made to ensure compliance with IFRS 9.
Some of the key requirements are listed in the following table.

The extent of any increase in provisions will depend upon on a number factors including the composition of the Groups lending portfolios and forecast economic conditions at the date of implementation.
Whilst the Group is still refining its methodology and completing the development of the models required to calculate the provision, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the impact of adopting IFRS 9.
It is also too early to estimate the ongoing impact of the IFRS 9 impairment model on the financial results although the requirement to transfer assets between stages and to incorporate forward looking data into the expected credit loss calculation, including multiple economic scenarios, could result in impairment charges being more volatile when compared to the current IAS 39 impairment model.
The regulatory capital impact of IFRS9 could be affected by changes to the regulatory rules.
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has issued two papers on the impacts of IFRS 9 on regulatory capital, a consultation paper on the Regulatory treatment of accounting provisions interim approach and transitional arrangements: and one discussing longer-term changes.
It is not clear whether any transitional capital arrangements will be in place for 1 January 2018.
Hedge Accounting The hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 are more closely aligned with risk management practices and follow a more principle-based approach than IAS 39.
The standard does not address macro hedge accounting, which is being considered in a separate IASB project.
There is an option to maintain the existing IAS 39 hedge accounting rules until the IASB completes its project on macro hedging.
The Group currently expects to continue applying IAS 39 hedge accounting in accordance with this accounting policy choice.
IFRS 9 Implementation Programme The Group has an established IFRS 9 programme to ensure a high quality implementation in compliance with the standard and additional regulatory guidance that has been issued.
The programme involves Finance and Risk functions across the Group with Divisional and Group steering committees providing oversight.
The key responsibilities of the programme include defining IFRS 9 methodology and accounting policy, development of ECL models, identifying data and system requirements, and establishing an appropriate operating model and governance framework.
The programme is progressing in line with current delivery plans.
Credit risk methodologies have been defined and model build and approval is underway for core portfolios.
The Retail secured model has been approved by the Model Governance Committee.
Models and credit risk processes will be tested during the parallel run period to embed the changes and help improve the understanding of the new impairment models.
Finance systems and reporting requirements are being developed and tested.
Existing controls and governance structures have been reviewed and changes identified as a result of IFRS 9.
The governance framework includes the review, challenge and sign-off of forward looking information for a range of economic scenarios.
Communication and training plans are in place and the impact on resources within Finance and Risk functions is being assessed to ensure the business is ready to implement the new standard.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
Financial instruments, leases and insurance contracts are out of scope however, fee recognition associated with credit cards and packaged products, for example, will need to be reviewed.
The standard is not currently expected to have a significant impact on the Groups profitability.
Limited, or no systems or process impacts are expected as a result of adopting IFRS 15.
IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases and requires lessees to recognise a right of use asset and a liability for future payments arising from a lease contract.
Lessees will recognise a finance charge on the liability and a depreciation charge on the asset which could affect the timing of the recognition of expenses on leased assets.
This change will mainly impact the properties that the Group currently accounts for as operating leases.
Finance systems will need to be changed to reflect the new accounting rules and disclosures.
Lessor accounting requirements remain aligned to the current approach under IAS 17.
IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
Minor amendments to other accounting standards During 2016, the IASB has issued amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows which require additional disclosure about an entitys financing activities and IAS 12 Income Taxes which clarify when a deferred tax asset should be recognised for unrealised losses together with a number of other minor amendments to IFRSs, which will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after either 1 January 2017 or 1 January 2018.
These revised requirements are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
