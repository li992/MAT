Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 Financial statements Notes to the Company financial statements 1 Basis of preparation Bunzl plc the 'Company' is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
These financial statements present information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its Group.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention with the exception of certain items which are measured at fair value as described in the accounting policies below.
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101 and the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using FRS 101.
There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations that are applicable to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2016.
In preparing these financial statements the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of: a cash flow statement and related notes: comparative period reconciliations for share capital and tangible fixed assets: disclosures relating to transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries and capital management: the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs: and disclosures relating to the compensation of key management personnel.
As the consolidated financial statements of the Company include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of: certain disclosures required by IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of Group settled share based payments: and certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments.
2 Accounting policies The accounting policies of the Company have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
The Company has changed the presentation of software assets to show them separately as intangible assets, reducing tangible assets by 0.7m at 31 December 2015.
This is consistent with the reclassification for the Group explained in Note 1 i to the consolidated financial statements.
In most cases the accounting policies for the Company are fully aligned with the equivalent accounting policy for the Group as stated on pages 98 to 102 in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policies of the Company which are aligned with those of the Group are the policies for tangible assets, intangible assets, income tax, provisions, retirement benefits, investment in own shares, dividends and leases.
The accounting policies that are specific to the Company are set out below.
a Investment in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
The subsidiary undertakings which the Company held at 31 December 2016 are disclosed in the Related undertakings note in the Shareholder information section on pages 146 to 148. b Share based payments The Company operates a number of equity settled share based payment compensation plans.
Details of these plans are outlined in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and the Directors remuneration report.
The total expected expense is based on the fair value of options and other share based incentives on the grant date calculated using a valuation model which is spread over the expected vesting period with a corresponding credit to equity.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries and it has not recharged the cost to the relevant subsidiaries, it recognises, in its individual financial statements, an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity settled share based payment charge recognised in its consolidated financial statements, with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
c Financial guarantee contracts Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
d Defined benefit pension schemes The Company is the sponsoring company of the UK defined benefit pension scheme.
As there is no contractual agreement or stated Group policy for charging the net defined benefit cost of the scheme to participating subsidiaries, the net defined benefit pension cost or benefit is recognised fully by the Company.
The contributions paid by the participating subsidiaries other than the Company are credited to profit or loss of the Company where the amounts relate to service and are independent of the number of years of service or to other comprehensive income if not linked to service.
134 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2016 2 Accounting policies continued Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions In preparing these financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the choice and application of the Companys accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and profit or loss.
Actual results may differ from those derived from the application of such judgements, estimates and assumptions, in particular those which involve anticipating future events.
Accordingly, the judgements, estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with the impact of any revisions considered necessary being recognised prospectively thereafter.
The key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have most risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 are the carrying value of investments, as explained below, and the measurement of the defined benefit pension scheme liability which is explained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
The directors believe that the judgements, estimates and assumptions applied in the preparation of these financial statements are appropriate.
Where relevant and practicable, sensitivity analysis is disclosed in the relevant Notes to the consolidated financial statements to demonstrate the impact of changes in estimates or assumptions used.
Recoverability of investments The carrying amounts of the Companys non-financial assets, in particular the investments in subsidiary undertakings, are reviewed annually to determine if there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amounts are estimated.
The recoverable amounts of assets are the greater of their fair value less the costs of disposal and their value in use.
In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using appropriate pre-tax discount rates.
Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount with impairment losses being recognised in profit or loss.

Following the enactment of legislation in the UK, the corporation tax rate will be reduced from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and from 19% to 17% from 1 April 2020.
Accordingly, the UK tax rate used for measuring deferred tax reflects the rate expected to be applied when the temporary differences reverse.
It is probable that the deferred tax assets recognised will be realised.
The recovery of the net deferred tax asset will be over more than one year.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of unutilised capital losses of 70.6m 2015: 70.6m.
