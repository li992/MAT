These changes were substantively enacted on 6 September 2016 and hence the effect of the change on the deferred tax balances has been included, depending upon when deferred tax is expected to reverse.
The Groups profit before taxation will continue to arise in jurisdictions where the effective rate of taxation differs from that in the UK.
Furthermore, unsuccessful exploration expenditure is often incurred in jurisdictions where the Group has no taxable profits, such that no related tax benefit arises.
Accordingly, the Groups tax charge will continue to vary according to the jurisdictions in which pre-tax profits and exploration costs written off arise.
The Group has tax losses of $2,844.0 million 2015: $1,802.0 million that are available for offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group due to uncertainty of recovery.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of $8.2 million 2015: $8.5 million relating to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax relating to components of other comprehensive income During 2016 $108.8 million 2015: $42.3 million of tax has been recognised through other comprehensive income of which $107.8 million 2015: $43.2 million is current and $0.9 million 2015: $0.9 million is deferred tax relating to all credits 2015: charges on cash flow hedges arising in the year.
Current tax assets As at 31 December 2016, current tax assets were $138.3 million 2015: $127.6 million of which $90.0 million 2015: $55.0 million relates to Norway, where 78% of exploration expenditure is refunded as a tax refund in the year following the incurrence of such expenditure.
