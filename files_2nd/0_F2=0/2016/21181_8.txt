AVEVA GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Strategy in Action Plant operators AVEVA WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH PLANT OPERATORS ON LARGE CAPEX PROJECTS, WITH A GREATER FOCUS ON DOWNSTREAM ACTIVITIES Case study GS CALTEX GS Caltex was founded in May 1967 as the first private oil company in Korea.
Jointly owned by Chevron and GS Group, it provides more than 30% of Koreas oil needs and exports over 50% of its products.
The company has deployed AVEVA E3D as the foundation of an innovative pipe corrosion management system that enables GS Caltex to understand the history, service life, operating condition and accessibility of each section of pipe, by viewing it on the 3D model of the facility.
Continual condition monitoring enables engineers to estimate the corrosion rate of each pipe and its remaining life.
Being able to predict corrosion means that parts can be replaced during scheduled, routine maintenance activity, not as unscheduled downtime.
