Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2016 tabular amounts only are in thousands of US dollars, except per share data 15.
Tax continued Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of carry forward tax losses amounting to approximately $7,805,000 31 December 2015: $1,644,000 in certain companies within the Group since it is considered unlikely that sufficient taxable profits will arise in those entities in future periods.
The losses are principally represented by excess interest deductions which arose on shareholder loans to the Skrill Group before it was acquired by Paysafe in August 2015.
"Trade and other payables Digital Wallets loyalty program The Group launched the NETELLER Reward Points Program the ""Program"" in February 2012."
The Program allows members to earn points on their transactions in the NETELLER digital wallets accounts.
Members can redeem these points for merchandise, cash exchange, and other NETELLER provided services.
When points are earned by members, the Group establishes a liability for future redemptions by multiplying the number of points issued by the estimated cost per point.
The actual cost of merchandise redemptions is applied against this liability.
The expense has been included in cost of sales.
The estimated cost per point is determined based on many factors, primarily related to expected future redemption patterns and associated costs.
The Group monitors, on an ongoing basis, trends in redemption rates and net cost per point redeemed.
Adjustments to the estimated cost per point are made based upon expected future Program activities.
Any variance in the cost per point is recognised in cost of sales in the Groups consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The liability account is adjusted based on the outstanding balance of points issued on a monthly basis.
The Group continues to evaluate and revise certain assumptions used to calculate the Program liability, based on redemption experience and expected future activities.
Provision for merchant losses In certain cases, transactions may be charged back to merchants, which means the transaction amount is refunded to the consumer and, in certain instances, charged to the merchant.
If the merchant has insufficient funds, the Group must bear the credit risk for the full amount of the transaction.
Management evaluates the risk for such transactions and estimates the loss for the disputed transactions based primarily on historical experience and other relevant factors.
A provision is maintained for merchant losses in order to absorb charge backs and other losses for merchant transactions that have been previously processed and on which revenue has been recorded.
Management analyses and regularly reviews the adequacy of its provision for merchant losses.
The provision for merchant losses comprises specifically identifiable provisions for merchant transactions for which losses can be estimated based on historical experience.
The net charge for the provision for merchant losses is included under the caption Payment Processing expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
