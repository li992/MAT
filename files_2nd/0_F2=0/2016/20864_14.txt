Although the rate of PGM Underlying EBITDA decreased by 26% to $532 million recovery from recycled autocatalysts increased towards 2015: $718 million.
Lower sales volumes of platinum, the end of the year, there was only limited growth in PGM palladium, rhodium and minor metals, weakening dollar supplies from the secondary recycling sector.
metal prices and the effects of inflation were partially offset by a weaker South African rand and cost improvements.
Platinum demand declined by 1%, with a 15% decrease in demand from the jewellery sector largely offset by a 10% Unit costs decreased by 12% to $1,330 per ounce, owing increase in purchases for industrial applications.

for platinum in the automotive sector increased by 2%, supported by the introduction of Euro 6b emissions regulations in September 2015, and consequent higher catalyst loadings.
Strong sales growth in the European car market saw an increase in the number of diesel cars being manufactured, though diesels share of the new car market decreased slightly.
The platinum market remained in deficit in 2016.
In contrast, palladium offtake increased by 2%, with strong growth in the predominantly petrol-engined Chinese car market supporting automotive demand, which increased by 3% to 7.8 million ounces.
Despite continued net liquidation of palladium investments, the palladium market remained in deficit in 2016, contributing to a rally in the price of the metal as the year progressed.

Unki, Union and independently managed operations were partly offset by lower output from Rustenburg and Bokoni.
OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK Putting Twickenham onto care and maintenance removed approximately 10,000 ounces of unprofitable platinum, Platinum production guidance metal in concentrate is while a contractual agreement with a third party for 2.35-2.4 million ounces for 2017 previously 2.4 millionconcentrate ended in 2015, which led to a reduction in 2.5 million ounces, largely driven by an increase in purchase purchase of concentrate of 11,000 ounces compared of concentrate from third parties.
Year-on-year production with 2015. from own-managed mines is expected to remain flat at around 960,000 ounces.
Mogalakwena mine increased production by 5% to 412,000 ounces 2015: 392,000 ounces, including 31,000 ounces 2015: 24,000 ounces processed at the Baobab concentrator.
Mogalakwena had a strong mining performance, with an 8% increase in tonnes milled.
At Amandelbult mine, despite a loss of 20,000 ounces following a fatal incident in which two employees lost their lives, and the subsequent Section 54 safety stoppage, production increased by 7%, reaching 467,000 ounces 2015: 437,000 ounces.
The majority of the increase came from a continued strong performance at the opencast area, which produced 41,000 ounces.
Production from Unki mine in Zimbabwe increased by 1 12% to 75,000 ounces 2015: 66,000 ounces, driven mainly by an improvement in recovered grade through better mining reef cut, which reduced waste mining, resulting in more higher grade ore being delivered to the concentrator.
As a result, the 4E built-up head grade increased to 3.46g t from 3.22g t. Total production from Rustenburg mine, including the Western Limb Tailings Retreatment plant, decreased by 4% 2 to 460,000 ounces 2015: 478,000 ounces.
Lower output was attributable to four fatal incidents, Section 54 safety stoppages and other incidents, as well as other operational challenges.
The sale of the Rustenburg operations was completed on 1 November 2016: from this date, Rustenburg production is being treated as a purchase of concentrate rather than own mined ounces.
