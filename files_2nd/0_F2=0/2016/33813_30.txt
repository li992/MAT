See Note 6 for further details.
Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and investment properties, including investment properties under construction and land which are included at fair value.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs and interpretations adopted by the European Union and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Standards affecting the financial statements The following standards and amendments became effective for the Company in the year ended 31 March 2016.
The pronouncements either had no material impact on the financial statements or resulted in changes in presentation and disclosure only: Annual improvements 2010 2012 cycle Annual improvements 2011 2013 cycle Standards in issue not yet effective The following standards and amendments are in issue as at the date of the approval of these financial statements, but are not yet effective for the Company.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed below will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company in future periods but are continuing to assess the potential impact effective for periods beginning on or after the date in brackets : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments not yet endorsed in the EU IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers not yet endorsed in the EU IFRS 16 Leases not yet endorsed in the EU Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 1 January 2016 Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements Amendments to IAS 27 1 January 2016 Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 1 1 January 2016 Annual improvements 2012 2014 cycle The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Directors Report on page 86 and are presented in sterling.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the results, other gains and losses, liabilities and cash flows of entities included in the consolidated financial statements.
All intragroup balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Significant judgements and key estimates The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that may affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Property valuations The key source of estimation and uncertainty relates to the valuation of the property portfolio, where a valuation is obtained twice a year from professionally qualified external valuers.
The evidence to support these valuations is based primarily on recent, comparable market transactions on an arms length basis.
However, the assumptions applied are inherently subjective and so are subject to a degree of uncertainty.
Property valuations are one of the principal uncertainties of the Group.

Significant accounting policies continued Accounting for acquisitions A degree of judgement is required in relation to acquisitions to determine whether they should be accounted for as business combinations under IFRS 3 or as asset purchases.
Consideration is taken of all the facts, including whether business processes or employees have been assumed, concerning the transaction in making the appropriate judgement.
In addition, the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as part of the transaction must be determined, which is based on external market evidence where available.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities.
In the Company financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
Where properties are acquired through the purchase of a corporate entity but the transaction does not meet the definition of a business combination under IFRS 3, the purchase is treated as an asset acquisition.
Where the acquisition is considered a business combination, the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is held as goodwill, initially recognised at cost with subsequent impairment assessments completed at least annually.
Where the initial calculation of goodwill arising is negative, this is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Property portfolio Properties are externally valued on an open market basis as at the balance sheet date and are recorded at valuation.
Any surplus or deficit arising on revaluing investment properties and investment property under construction IPUC is recognised in the income statement.
All costs associated with the purchase and construction of IPUC are capitalised including attributable interest.
Interest is calculated on the expenditure by reference to specific borrowings where relevant and otherwise on the average rate applicable to short-term loans.
When IPUC are completed, they are classified as investment properties.
In determining whether leases and related properties represent operating or finance leases, consideration is given to whether the tenant or landlord bears the risks and rewards of ownership.
Leasehold properties that are leased out to tenants under operating leases are classified as investment properties or development properties, as appropriate, and included in the balance sheet at fair value.
Where an investment property is held under a head lease it is initially recognised as an asset as the sum of the premium paid on acquisition and the present value of minimum ground rent payments.
The corresponding rent liability to the head leaseholder is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
The market value of investment property as estimated by an external valuer is increased for the unamortised pharmacy lease premium held at the balance sheet date.
Net rental income Rental income is recognised on an accruals basis and recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
A rent adjustment based on open market estimated rental value is recognised from the rent review date in relation to unsettled rent reviews.
Pharmacy lease premiums received from tenants are spread over the lease term, even if the receipts are not received on such a basis.
The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease.
Property operating expenses are expensed as incurred and property operating expenditure not recovered from tenants through service charges is charged to the income statement.

Significant accounting policies continued Gains on sale of properties Gains on sale of properties are recognised on the completion of contract, and are calculated by reference to the carrying value at the end of the previous reporting period, adjusted for subsequent capital expenditure.
Financial assets and liabilities Trade receivables and payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost and discounted as appropriate.
Other investments are shown at amortised cost and held as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate.
Debt instruments are stated at their net proceeds on issue.
Finance charges including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs are spread over the period to redemption at a constant rate on the carrying amount of the liability.
Financial instruments Where the Group uses derivative financial instruments, in the form of interest rate swaps, to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations they are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value by reference to market values for similar instruments.
The resulting gains or losses are recognised through the income statement.
Cash equivalents are limited to instruments with a maturity of less than three months.
Tax Current tax is expected tax payable on any non-REIT taxable income for the period and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are not taxable or tax deductible.
Deferred tax is provided on items that may become taxable at a later date, on the difference between the balance sheet value and tax base value, on an undiscounted basis.
Income statement definitions Underlying profit represents adjusted earnings, with further Company adjustments to exclude items such as property revaluations, exceptional items and share-based payment charges.
These adjustments have been made on the basis they are non-recurring or non-cash fair value adjustments, which are not reflective of the underlying performance of the business.
Capital and other represents all other statutory income statement items that are not considered underlying, including exceptional items.
Employee costs Defined contribution pension plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Share-based employee remuneration Share-based employee remuneration is determined with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted and charged to the income statement over the vesting period on a straight line basis.
The fair value of share options is calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model or the Monte Carlo Model and is dependent on factors including the exercise price, expected volatility, option life and risk free interest rate.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payments has been applied to share options granted.
Segmental information The Group is run as one business and as such no segmental analysis is presented for the current or prior year results.

The UK REIT rules exempt the profits of the Groups property rental business from corporation tax.
Gains on properties are also exempt from tax, provided they are not held for trading or sold in the three years post completion of development.
The Group will otherwise be subject to corporation tax at 20% 2016: 20%.
The Group tax charge credit relates to its non-property income.
As the Group has sufficient brought forward tax losses, no tax is due and so the amount represents the movement in deferred tax.
The movement in part relates to brought forward losses that have been utilised during the year, with the remainder representing a change in the estimated losses that will be utilised in the future.
As a REIT, the Group is required to pay Property Income Distributions PIDs equal to at least 90% of the Groups rental profit calculated by reference to tax rules rather than accounting standards.
In the year to 31 March 2016 the taxable rental profit of the Group was nil as a result of capital allowances available, and consequently no PID was required.
To remain as a UK REIT there are a number of conditions to be met in respect of the principal company of the Group, the Groups qualifying activities and the balance of business.
The Group remains compliant at 31 March 2016.
Further reductions in the main rate of corporation tax have been substantively enacted: the rate will reduce to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020.
These changes have been reflected in the calculation of deferred tax.

Property assets Investment property and investment property under construction IPUC Properties are stated at fair value, which has been determined for the Group by Savills Commercial Limited and Jones Lang LaSalle as at 31 March 2016.
The properties have been valued individually and on the basis of open market value in accordance with RICS Valuation Professional Standards 2014 the Red Book.
Valuers are paid on the basis of a fixed fee arrangement, subject to the number of properties valued.
Initial yields mainly range from 4.65% to 5.25% 2015: 5.25% to 5.50% for prime units, increasing up to 6.15% March 2015: 6.15% for older units with shorter unexpired lease terms.
For properties with weaker tenants and poorer units, the yields range from 6.15% to over 8.0% March 2015: 6.25% and over 8.0% and higher for those very close to lease expiry or those approaching obsolescence.
A 0.25% shift of valuation yield would have approximately a 54.2 million 2015: 42.8 million impact on the investment property valuation.

Share-based payments As at 31 March 2016, the Group had two long-term incentive schemes in place the Value Creation Plan VCP and the Executive Recruitment Plan ERP.
The long-term incentive arrangements are structured so as to align the incentives of relevant Executives with the long-term performance of the business and to motivate and retain key members of staff.
To the extent practicable long-term incentives are provided through the use of share-based or share-fulfilled remuneration to provide alignment of objectives with the Groups shareholders.
Long-term incentive awards are granted by the Remuneration Committee which reviews award levels on a case by case basis.
As at 31 March 2016 the Employee Benefit Trust held a total of 1,256,714 2015: 3,911,551 Ordinary Shares of 10 pence each in Assura plc.
Previous long-term incentive plans have lapsed without vesting.

Participants have the opportunity to receive 10% of the total value created for shareholders above a threshold price determined at three Measurement Dates in a five-year measurement period.
Before any awards vest, which are granted as nil-cost options on conversion of any value created, a minimum level of Total Shareholder Return of 8% per annum compound growth from the Base Price at each Measurement Date must be achieved.

Share-based payments continued All schemes The fair value of equity settled units granted during 2013 was estimated as at the date of grant using the Monte Carlo Model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which units were granted.
The following table lists the inputs to the models used for the year ended 31 March 2013, being the last point at which a valuation was required under IFRS 2: 2013 Dividend yield % 3.5 Expected share price volatility % 20.7 Risk free interest rate % 0.74 Expected life of units years 4.5 The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The fair value of the units granted in 2013 was 2,475,000 based on the market price at the date the units were granted.
This cost is allocated over the vesting period.
The cost allocation for all outstanding units in the period was a charge of 468,500 2015: charge of 623,500 and an additional charge has been recorded during the year in respect of the employer national insurance contributions payable on the awards so that the total income statement charge was 1.9 million 2015: 0.7 million.
No share options were outstanding as at 31 March 2016.
For share options outstanding as at 31 March 2015, the weighted average remaining contractual life was 0.83 years.

Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group holds cash and liquid resources as well as having debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments and properties are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and capital risk.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
In the event of a default by an occupational tenant, the Group will suffer a rental income shortfall and may incur additional costs, including legal expenses, in maintaining, insuring and re-letting the property.
Given the nature of the Companys tenants and enhanced rights of landlords who can issue proceedings and enforcement by bailiffs, defaults are rare and potential defaults are managed carefully by the credit control department.
The maximum credit exposure in aggregate is one quarters rent of circa 16 million: however, this amount derives from all the tenants in the portfolio and such a scenario is hypothetical.
The Groups credit risk is well spread across circa 685 tenants at any one time.
Furthermore the bulk of the Groups property income derives from the NHS or is reimbursed by the NHS, which has an obligation to ensure that patients can be seen and treated and steps in when GPs are unable to practise, hence the risk of default is minimal.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their carrying values as at the balance sheet date.

Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments.
Investments in property are relatively illiquid: however, the Group has tried to mitigate this risk by investing in modern purpose built medical centres which are let to GPs and NHS PropCo.
In order to progress its property investment and development programme, the Group needs access to bank and equity finance, both of which may be difficult to raise notwithstanding the quality, long lease length, NHS backing and geographical and lot size diversity of its property portfolio.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by ensuring that it has a spread of sources and maturities.
The Group has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property portfolio.
These non-cancellable leases have remaining terms of up to 30 years and have a weighted average lease length of 14.0 years.
All leases are subject to revision of rents according to various rent review clauses.
Future minimum rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases along with trade and other receivable as at 31 March are as follows: On Less than 3 to 12 1 to 5 demand 3 months months years 5 years Total Receivables as at 31 March 2016 m m m m m m Non-cancellable leases 15.9 47.8 252.7 629.0 945.4 Trade and other receivables 7.5 7.5 23.4 47.8 252.7 629.0 952.9 On Less than 3 to 12 1 to 5 demand 3 months months years 5 years Total Receivables as at 31 March 2015 m m m m m m Non-cancellable leases 14.0 41.9 223.9 573.2 853.0 Trade and other receivables 8.3 8.3 22.3 41.9 223.9 573.2 861.3 The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, including interest, at 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2015 based on contractual undiscounted payments at the earliest date which the Group can be required to pay.
The total contracted discounted payments are higher than the total minimum rentals receivable due to the rent receivable not including any residual values on properties at the end of the lease contract.
In practice, the Group expects a significant renewal of leases at the end of the lease term.

Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Groups cash deposits and, as debt is utilised, long-term debt obligations.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using fixed rate debt, or by interest rate swaps, for the majority of loans and borrowings although the Group will accept some exposure to variable rates where deemed appropriate and restricted to one third of the loan book.
The swaps are revalued to their market value by reference to market interest rates at each balance sheet date.
The ageing analysis of the financial assets and liabilities excluding trade receivables and payables of the Group at 31 March 2016 was as follows: Within 1 to 5 1 year years 5 years Total m m m m Floating rate asset Cash 44.3 44.3 Liabilities fixed rate unless stated Long-term loans: Revolving credit facility variable rate 45.0 45.0 Bond 110.0 110.0 Aviva 4.0 18.6 195.2 217.8 Payments due under finance leases 0.2 2.8 3.0 In November 2011 the Group issued a 110.0 million 10-year senior secured bond at 4.75%.
Aviva loans decreased during the period to 217.8 million 2015: 406.6 million.
The Aviva loans are partially amortised by way of quarterly instalments and partially repaid by way of bullet repayments falling due between 2024 and 2044.
4.0 million is due within a year.
The loans are subject to fixed all-in interest rates ranging between 4.11% and 6.66%.
The Group has a revolving credit facility of 120 million which expires in 2020.
Interest is charged at an initial rate of LIBOR plus 1.7% The ageing analysis of the financial assets and liabilities excluding trade receivables and payables of the Group at 31 March 2015 was as follows: Within 1 to 5 1 year years 5 years Total m m m m Floating rate asset Cash 66.5 66.5 Fixed rate all liabilities Long-term loans: Bond 110.0 110.0 Aviva 8.0 37.2 361.4 406.6 Payments due under finance leases 0.1 0.1 2.8 3.0 w ww ww.

Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis As at 31 March 2016, 88% of debt drawn by the Group is subject to fixed interest rates.
A 0.25% movement in interest rates would change underlying profit by 0.1 million based on the amount of variable rate debt drawn.

Capital risk The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may make disposals, adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors capital structure with reference to loan to value LTV, which is calculated as net debt divided by total property.
The LTV percentage on this basis is 30% at 31 March 2016 48% at 31 March 2015.
Commitments At the year end the Group had two 2015: five developments on site with a contracted total expenditure of 13.5 million 2015: 22.2 million of which 8.5 million 2015: 6.1 million had been expended.
Related party transactions Details of transactions during the year and outstanding balances at 31 March 2016 in respect of associates are detailed in Note 9.
Details of payments to key management personnel are provided in Note 4.
Post balance sheet events Subsequent to the year end, a subsidiary of the Group has replaced the existing revolving credit facility with a new unsecured revolving credit facility of 200 million with the potential to extend further to 300 million.
