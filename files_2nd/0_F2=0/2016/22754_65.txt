Financial Statements Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to providereturns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, as well as maintaining an optimal capital structure to reduce overallcost of capital.
In order to maintain this optimal structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid, issue new shares, return capital toshareholders or dispose of assets to reduce net debt.
Given the Groups strong balance sheet and sustained trading growth, theGroup announced a new dividend policy in 2011 of paying a dividend of between 40% and 50% of sustainable earnings.
Furtherdetails can be found in the Chairmans Statement on pages 2 and 3.
Underlying growth coupled to Return on Invested Capital ROIC is the key perceived driver of shareholder value within the Group.
Theacquisition of Uniqema in 2006 reduced the ROIC, but also reduced Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC since the deal waspredominantly financed through debt.
The Groups ROIC now stands at 19.3% against a post-tax WACC of 5.3%, thus hitting the Groups target of maintaining ROIC at a higher level than the WACC.
In addition, the Group employs two widely used ratios to measure our ability to service our debt.
Both net debt EBITDA and EBITDA interest cover were well ahead of target in 2016.
Further details can be found in the Finance Report on pages 24 to 27.
The Group was in compliance with its covenant requirements throughout the year.

The environmental provision relates to soil and potential groundwater contamination on a number of sites, both currently in use andpreviously occupied, in Europe and the Americas.
In relation to the environmental provision, the Directors consider that the balance will be utilised within 20 years.

The costs are based on currently available facts and prior experience.
Environmental liabilities are recorded at the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled at the balance sheet date.
Remediation of environmental damage typically takes a long time to complete due to the substantial amount of planning and regulatory approvals normally required before remediation activities can begin.
In addition, increases in or releases of environmental provisions may be necessary whenever new developments occur or additional information becomes available.
Consequently, environmental provisions can change significantly.
The level of environmental provision is based on managements best estimate of the most likely outcome for each individual exposure.
The Group has also considered the impact of discounting on its provisions and hasconcluded that, as a consequence of the significant utilisation expected in a relatively short timescale, the impact is not material.
The restructuring provision primarily relates to the reorganisation of Incotec.
