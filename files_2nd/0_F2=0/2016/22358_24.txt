STRATEGIC REPORT G OVERNANCE F INANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS u Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Forming Part of the Financial Statements 1.
Accounting Policies Basis of Preparation Cineworld Group plc the Company is a company incorporated in the UK.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK standards including FRS101 Reduced Disclosure Framework: these are presented on pages 129 to 137.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all years presented in these Group financial statements.
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next financial year are set out below.
Information regarding the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position is set out in the Chief Executive Officers Review on pages 6 to 7 and the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 22 to 27.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 28 to 32.
In addition Note 21 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
At the year end the Group met its day-to-day working capital requirements through its bank loan, which consisted of a term loan and a revolving facility see Note 16 to the financial statements.
Reclassification of items in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss To ensure the cost allocations within the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss are consistent with the operations of the Group, the classification of items between administrative expenses and cost of sales have been reviewed.
Two reclassifications have been made to the comparative results for the year ended 31 December 2015: A proportion of UK cinema wage costs which were previously included in administrative expenses have been reclassified to cost of sales so all cinema employee costs are now included in cost of sales.
For consistency, credits to the Statement of Profit or Loss in respect of operating leases have been reclassified from administrative expenses to cost of sales to net against the charges.
All operating lease items are now shown in cost of sales.
Overall there is no impact on EBITDA, operating profit, the profit after tax or the net assets of the Group.
Going Concern At the year end the Group met its day-to-day working capital requirements through its bank loan, which consisted of a term loanand a revolving facility see Note 16 to the financial statements.
The Group entered into a five-year facility in January 2014 which included term loans of 165.0m and 132.0m and revolving credit facilities of 75.0m and 60.0m.
On 29 July 2015 the Group signed an amendment and extension to its existing banking facility which was effective immediately upon signing and extends the facility to June 2020.
As a result, the term loans were reduced from 157.5m and 126.0m to 130.0m and 63.0m.
In August 2016 the Group extended the single currency revolving credit facility of 190.0m to 215.0m to partly fund the empire acquisition.
The facility remains subject to the existing two covenants: the ratio of EBITDA as defined in Note 1 to net debt and the ratio of EBITDAR pre-rent EBITDA to net finance charges.
A margin, determined by the results of the covenant tests at a given date is added to LIBOR or EURIBOR.
The margins currently applicable to Group are 1.40% on the term loans and 1.15% on the revolving credit facility.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current facility for at least 12 months from the approval date of the financialstatements, including compliance with the bank facility covenants.
The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis.
Measurement Convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments and financial instruments classified as fair value through the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income or as available for sale.

Accounting Policies continued Basis of Consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
Jointly Controlled Entities Equity Accounted Investees Jointly controlled entities are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring the venturers unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions.
Jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method equity accounted investees and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expense and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the investee.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only tothe extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Use of non-GAAP Profit and Loss Measures The Group believes that along with operating profit, the following measures, provide additional guidance to the statutory measures of the performance of the business during the financial year: EBITDA Adjusted profit before tax Adjusted profit after tax The Group defines EBITDA as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as Operating profit before depreciation and amortisation, onerous leases and other non-recurring charges, impairments and reversals of impairments, transaction and reorganisation costs, profit on disposals of assets and the settlement of the defined benefit pension liability.
EBITDA is considered an accurate and consistent measure of the Groups trading performance, items adjusted to arrive at EBITDA are considered to be outside the Groups ongoing trading activities.
Adjusted profit before tax is calculated by adding back amortisation of intangible assets excluding acquired movie distribution rights, and certain non-recurring, non cash items and foreign exchange as set out in Note 5.
Adjusted profit before tax is an internal measure used by management, as they believe it better reflects theunderlying performance of the Group and therefore a more meaningful comparison of performance from period to period.
Adjusted profit after tax is arrived at by applying an effective tax rate to taxable adjustments and deducting the total from adjusted profit before tax.
Foreign Currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assetsand liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the Balance Sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translatedat foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of thetransactions.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Cash Flow Hedges and Interest Swap Policy Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting when recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
| CINEWORLD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 88 STRATEGIC REPORT G OVERNANCE F INANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS u 1.
Accounting Policies continued The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the Balance Sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the Balance Sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the Statement of ComprehensiveIncome.
For cash flow hedges, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income immediately.
Net Investment Hedge The Group uses net investment hedges to mitigate translation exposure on certain net investments in subsidiary companies.
Changes in the fair values of hedging instruments are taken directly to the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income together with gains or losses on the foreign currency translation of the hedged investments.
Until the investment is disposed all of these gains or losses are recognised in equity, within the hedging reserve.
Non-Derivative Financial Instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and Other Receivables Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequently they are carried at amortised costusing the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
A bad debt allowance for receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of thereceivables.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
Trade and Other Payables Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value.
They are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest-Bearing Borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are initially measured at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
They are subsequently carried at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as financeleases.
Where land and buildings are held under finance leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower oftheir fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
All other leases are operating leases.
These leased assets are not recognised in the Groups Balance Sheet.
| CINEWORLD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 89 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS u Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued Depreciation is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income to write assets down to their residual values on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful lives are asfollows: Land and buildings: freehold properties 50 years Land and buildings: long leasehold properties including leasehold improvements life of lease Land and buildings: short leasehold properties including leasehold improvements 30 years or life of lease if shorter Plant and machinery 3 to 16 years Fixtures and fittings 3 to 16 years No depreciation is provided on land, assets held for sale or assets in the course of construction.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation methods, residual values and the useful lives of all assets are reassessed annually.
Business Combinations For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the fair value of any previously-held equity interest in the acquire and the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit or Loss.
Transactions costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities that the Group incurs in connection with business combinations are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Distribution rights that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the Statement of Profit or Loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each Balance Sheet date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
Distribution rights are amortised by film title from the date of release of the film, at 50% in the first year of release and 25% in each of the two subsequent years.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Brands 10 to 20 years Distribution rights 3 years Other intangibles 5 to 10 years Non-current Assets Held for Sale A non-current asset or a group of assets containing a non-current asset a disposal group is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale and sale is highly probable within one year.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to Statement of Profit or Loss.
The same applies to gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement although gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.
Any impairment loss on a disposal group first is allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis, except that no loss isallocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets and investment property, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment once classified as held for sale or distribution are not amortised or depreciated.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories is based on the First-In, First-Out FIFO principle.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition, and net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated sellingcosts.

Accounting Policies continued Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill assets that have an indefinite useful economic life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each Balance Sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwillallocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other intangible assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent ofthe cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of Recoverable Amount The recoverable amount is the greater of the assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Reversals of Impairment An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist as a result of a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, including a change in fair value less costs to sell.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Employee Benefits Defined Contribution Pension Plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Profit or Loss asincurred.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior years, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value ofany plan assets.
The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements.
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets excluding interest and the effect of the asset ceiling if any, excluding interest, are recognised immediately in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income.
The Group determines the net interest expense income on the net defined benefit liability asset for the year by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual year to the then-net defined benefit liability asset, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability asset during the year as a result of contributions andbenefit payments.
Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss.
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit or Loss.
The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlementof a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.
Share-Based Payment Transactions The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date using the Black-Scholes model and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
Theamount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture isdue only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Share appreciation rights are also granted by the Group to employees.
The fair value of the amount payable to the employee isrecognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities.
The fair value is initially measured at grant date and spreadover the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The fair value of the share appreciation rights is measured taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The liability is remeasured at each Balance Sheet date and at settlement date and any changes in fair value are recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss.
| CINEWORLD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 91 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS u Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued Government Grants Government grants are recognised initially as deferred income at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant.
They are then recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss as other income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset to which they relate.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the Balance Sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Own Shares Held by Employee Benefit Trust EBT Transactions of the Group sponsored EBT are included in the Group financial information.
In particular, the trusts purchase of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
Revenue Revenue represents the total amount receivable for goods sold, excluding sales related taxes and intra-Group transactions.
All theGroups revenue is received from the sale of goods and services Box office revenue is recognised on the date of the showing of the film it relates to.
Concessions revenue is recognised at point of sale.
Advertising revenue is recognised over the period the advert is shown in cinemas.
Distribution revenue is recognised on the date of the showing of the film it relates to for cinema distribution, for other media the revenue is recognised over the life of the distribution contract.
Unlimited card revenue is received annually or monthly in advance.
When revenue from the Unlimited card is received annually in advance it is recognised on a straight-line basis over the year.
Monthly Unlimited card revenue is recognised in the period to which it relates.
Other revenue is recognised in the period to which it relates.
Given the nature of the Groups revenue streams recognition of revenue is not considered to be a significant judgement area.
Other Income Other income represents rent receivable and profit on disposals of fixed assets.
Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Expenses Operating Lease Payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Where the Group has operating leases that contain minimum guaranteed rental uplifts over the life of the lease, the Group recognises the guaranteed minimum lease payment on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Finance Lease Payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Net Financing Costs Net financing costs comprise interest payable, amortisation of financing costs, unwind of discount on property provisions, finance lease interest, net gain loss on remeasurement of interest rate swaps, interest receivable on funds invested, foreign exchange gains and losses and finance costs for defined benefit pension schemes.
Sale and Leaseback Where the Group enters into a sale and leaseback transaction whereby the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets concernedhave not been substantially transferred to the lessor, any excess of sales proceeds over the previous carrying amount are deferred and recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss over the lease term.
At the date of the transaction the assets and the associated finance lease liabilities on the Groups Balance Sheet are stated at the lower of fair value of the leased assets and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Where the Group enters into a sale and leaseback transaction whereby the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets concernedhave been substantially transferred to the lessor, any excess of sales proceeds over the previous carrying amount is recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss on completion of the transaction, when the sale and subsequent lease back has been completed at fair value.
| CINEWORLD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 92 STRATEGIC REPORT G OVERNANCE F INANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS u 1.
Accounting Policies continued Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the Balance Sheet method, providing temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expectedmanner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Operating Segments An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components.
An operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the Board of Directors to make decisions about resources to be allocated tothe segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Judgements The key judgements are: Business Combinations When the Group undertakes a business combination, there are specific judgments which need to be made in respect of the acquisition accounting.
This includes determining the fair value of the acquired total net identifiable assets, with particular reference to intangible assets, property plant and equipment, acquired leases and any required provisions.
Details of the acquisition undertaken by the Group during the year, including the specific judgements taken are set out in Note 15.
Finance and Operating Leases When the Group enters into a new lease it is required to consider whether it bears substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset.
The Group considers the requirements of IAS 17 Leases when determining whether it has an operating or finance lease, and in most cases the outcome is clear.
The Group is not intending to early adopt the new lease accounting standard, IFRS 16, Leasing which will be effective from 1 January 2019.
Depreciation and Amortisation For the Group to be able to depreciate the property, plant and equipment and amortise the intangible assets, appropriate usefuleconomic lives must be determined for each class of asset.
Judgement is applied based on knowledge and experience of the assets within the Group to determine the expected useful economic life for each of the different asset classes.
For all propertyplant and equipment or intangible asset additions these are allocated to the various asset classes and depreciated or amortised accordingly.
Hedging Arrangements In order to be able to hedge account the Group must consider the effectiveness of its hedging arrangements in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments.
The Group has two types of hedging arrangements, the first is interest rate swaps to fix a portion of its exposure to variable interest rates on its loan arrangements and the second is a net investment hedge to reduce the Groups future exposure to changes in foreign currency as a result of our foreign operations.
Judgement must be applied when determining whether financial instruments will be accounted for as a hedge and as to whether the required criteria for hedge accounting will be met by these specific instruments.
| CINEWORLD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 93 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS u Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued Estimates Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised and in any future years affected.
In applying the Groups accounting policies described above the Directors have identified that the following areas are the key estimates that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Impairment of Goodwill The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis.
This requires an estimate of the value in use of thecash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
To estimate the value in use, the Group estimates the expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit and discounts them to their present value at a determined discount rate, which is appropriate for the territory where the goodwill is allocated to.
Forecasting expected cash flows, and selecting an appropriate discount rate inherently requires estimation.
A sensitivity analysishas been performed over the estimates see Note 10.
Impairment of Tangible Fixed Assets The Group determines whether tangible fixed assets are impaired when indicators of impairments exist or based on the annual impairment assessment.
The annual assessment requires an estimate of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the tangible fixed assets are allocated, which is predominantly at the individual cinema site level.
Where individual sites cash flows are not considered independent from one another, mainly due to strategic or managerial decisions being made across more than one site, they may be combined into a single cash generating unit.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from each cinema and discount these to their net present value at a determined discount rate which is appropriate for the territory where the assets areheld.
The resulting calculation is sensitive to the assumptions in respect of future cash flows and the discount rate applied.
The Directors consider that the assumptions made represent their best estimate of the future cash flows generated by the cash generating units, and that the discount rate used is appropriate given the risks associated with the specific cash flows.
A sensitivity analysishas been performed over the estimates see Note 9.
Onerous Leases Provision is made for onerous leases where it is considered that the unavoidable costs of the lease obligations are in excess of the economic benefits expected to be received from operating it.
The unavoidable costs of the lease reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract and are measured as the lower of the net cost of continuing to operate the lease and any penalties or other costs from exiting it early.
When calculating the provision for an onerous lease the Group is required to make certain assumptions about the future cash flows to be generated from that cinema site.
It is also required to discount these cash flows using an appropriate discount rate which is appropriate to the territory where the cinema is located.
The resulting provision is sensitive to the assumptions in respect of future cash flows and the discount rate applied.
The Directors consider that the assumptions made represent their best estimate of the future cash flows to be generated by the cinema sites, and that the discount rate used is appropriate given the risks associated with these cash flows.
A sensitivity analysishas been performed over the estimates see Note 19.
Employee Post Retirement Benefit Obligations The Group had two defined benefit pension plans, the MGM Pension Scheme and the Adelphi-Carlton Limited Contributory Pension Plan.
The MGM Pension Scheme was settled during the year through an insurance buy-out arrangement.
The final present value of the obligation was calculated by independent actuaries as at the buy-out date, with input from management, in accordance with the Groups usual approach as outlined below.
Further details of the buy-out can be found in Note 18.
The obligations under these plans are recognised in the Balance Sheet and represent the present value of the obligations calculated by independent actuaries, with input from management.
These actuarial valuations include assumptions such as discount rates, return on assets, salary progression and mortality rates.
These assumptions vary from time to time according to prevailing economic and social conditions.
It is considered that the assumptions used are the most appropriate but it is recognised that the resulting pension liability can be very sensitive to these assumptions.
Details of the assumptions used are provided in Note 18.
Going forward without the MGM Pension Scheme the estimation uncertainty regarding employee post retirement benefit obligations will be significantly reduced for the Group as the Adelphi-Carlton scheme is less significant.

Accounting Policies continued Virtual Print Fees A Virtual Print Fee VPF is recognised as a discount from the cost the Group pays for film rental and reflects the cost saving to the studios of the move to digital.
The income recognition criteria in respect of the VPF received in the UK is complex as it includes the number, type and timing of screenings.
A VPF is receivable the first time a film is played in a digital format on a screen rather than using 35mm film.
A VPF is recognised on the date of the showing of the film it relates to and is included in cost of sales as a reduction of the film hirecosts.
VPFs in the UK were received in 2016, but will not be received thereafter.
Tax The Group operates in nine territories and is subject to tax in numerous territories and jurisdictions.
Judgement is required in determining the provisions in relation to tax as there are varying tax treatments which have to be applied to transactions across the jurisdictions.
The treatments can be complex and cannot be finally determined until formal resolutions have been reached with the relevant tax authorities these can take several years to conclude.
Provisions are made based on managements interpretation of country specific tax laws and likely settlement outcomes based on the facts known at the Balance Sheet date.
These judgements may impact the tax charge as well as the assets and liabilities.
Deferred taxes are recognised in respect of temporary differences between the tax treatment and treatment within the financial statements for assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent they are expected to be recovered.
Recoverability is assessed on an ongoing basis.
Deferred tax is calculated at the substantively enacted rate which is expected to apply in the period the asset or liability is expected to be realised.
New Standards and Interpretations The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations were adopted for the year ended 31 December 2016 and have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Annual improvements to IFRSs Disclosure initiative amendment to IAS1 The Group is currently assessing the impact of the following standards and interpretations which have been issued but which are not effective for the year ended 31 December 2016.
These standards and interpretations have not been adopted early.
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 16, Leasing At 31 December 2016 the impact of these changes on the Groups financial statements had not been quantified.
However the impact of IFRS 16, is expected to significantly affect the Groups lease accounting and Financial Statements.

Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, after excluding the weighted average number of non-vested ordinary shares held by the employee ownership trust.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated in the same way except that the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders is adjusted by adding back the amortisation of intangible assets recognised as part of business combinations and other oneoff income or expense and then adjusting for the tax impact on those items which is calculated at the effective tax rate for the current year.
The performance of adjusted earnings per share is used to determine awards to Executive Directors under the Group Performance Share Plan PSP.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by weighted average number of any non-vested ordinary shares held by the employee share ownership trust and after adjusting for the effects of dilutive options.

Factors that May Affect Future Tax Charges As at 31 December 2016 the Group had potential UK tax assets relating to the following: Capital losses of approximately 7.5m 2015: 7.5m.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on 5.8m of unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries which are potentially subject to withholding tax on distribution, as the Group can control the timing of remittances and it is probable that no remittance will be made in the foreseeable future.
No withholding tax or other taxes are imposed under local tax laws on the distribution of unremitted earnings from other subsidiaries resident in the majority of the Groups jurisdictions.
At 31 December 2016 the Group had unrecognised potential tax assets relating to the following temporary differences: UK capital losses of 7.5m Overseas tax losses of 1.6m expiring over periods to 2025 Other overseas temporary differences of 12.1m If is not considered probable that future taxable profit will be available against which these deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to the periods when the assets are realised or liabilities settled, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at 31 December 2016.
The Group operates in nine countries and is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions.
Judgement is required in determining the provision for taxes as the varying tax treatments applying to transactions across jurisdictions are complex and cannot be finally determined until formal resolutions have been reached with the relevant tax authorities.
These can take several years to conclude.
Provision is made based on managements interpretation of country specific tax laws and likely settlement outcomes.

Property, Plant and Equipment continued Impairment The Group determines whether tangible fixed assets are impaired when indicators of impairments exist or based on the annual impairment assessment.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from each CGU and discount these to their net present value at a pre-tax discount rate which is appropriate for the territory where the assets are held.
A table summarising the rates used, which are derived from externally benchmarked data, is set out below: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 m m United Kingdom 9.20% 11.36% 1 Israel 12.73% 17.28% Poland 12.65% 13.10% Bulgaria 10.64% 15.27% Romania 11.81% 16.69% Hungary 12.96% 17.78% Slovakia 11.11% 15.66% Czech Republic 11.04% 15.48% 1 For sites which generate significant rental cashflows in addition to cinema cashflows a separate discount rate of 13.06% was used to reflect the specific risks related to those CGUs.
For established sites, expected future cash flows are based on financial budgets approved by the Board of Directors covering a one-year period.
Cash flows beyond the first period are extrapolated using the assumptions used in the impairment model.
Constant growth rate assumptions are used for projections on established sites.
For new sites, where a constant growth would not accurately reflect market conditions, more detailed growth assumptions are used for the first five years.

2017 forecast EBITDA, as defined in Note 1, was used as the basis of the future cash flow calculation.
This was adjusted to add back rent EBITDAR.
Property costs are factored into the model, but are assumed to grow at 3.0% per annum over the life of themodel.
Cash flows are projected over the shorter of the life of the property lease or the intangible assets to which the cash flow relates.
Impairments recognised during the year totalled 1.3m within the UK and Ireland operating segment, 0.8m related to capital expenditure on cinema sites for which onerous lease provisions were in place, the remaining 0.5m related to the write off of residual assets held at sites which were closed during the year.
Impairment Reversals A review of future cash flows for previously impaired cinema sites identified improvements in trading performance at three sites sufficient to recognise a reversal of impairment.
An impairment reversal of 0.5m was recognised for one site in the UK and 1.2m relating to two sites in the ROW, of these reversals 1.2m arose due to previously independent CGUs being considered together as they are now considered to be strategically or operationally inter-dependant.
| CINEWORLD GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 103 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS u Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 9.
Property, Plant and Equipment continued Sensitivity to Changes in Assumptions Impairment reviews are sensitive to changes in key assumptions.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the established CGUs calculated recoverable amounts giving consideration to incremental changes in the key assumptions of EBITDAR and discount rates.
The cashflow models used in assessing the carrying values of sites opened within the last two years are based on specific assumptions made prior to opening in respect of the early growth phase of the sites.
Therefore sensitivity analysis is not applied to these sites during this time.
The sensitivities applied reflect realistic scenarios which management believe would have the most significant impact on the cash flows described above.
Discounts rates are largely derived from market data, and these rates are intended to be long term in nature so therefore should be reasonably stable in the short term.
However, the models are sensitive to changes in these rates.
Increases by a factor of 1%, 2% and 5% have been applied in the sensitised scenarios on the basis they reflect the range of likely to maximum variances in rates applied.
The growth rates for EBITDAR in years 1 and 2 have been reduced to 2%, 1% and nil.
EBITDAR sensitivities reflect reductions in growth which would largely be driven by changes in admissions and ticket price.
Given the short term admissions trends and ticket price inflation, sensitivities applied are believed to reflect a potential downside scenario.
From year 3 onward a lower long term growth rate is applied, which is in line or below long term inflation in each territory.
As such we already consider this assumption prudent and therefore this has not been included as part of the sensitivities performed.
When reviewing the outputs of the sensitivity analysis, particular focus is given to material amounts where headroom is morelimited.
The impact on the total impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth rates used in the first two years and the discount rates would be as follows: m EBITDAR growth rate in years 1-2 reduced to 2% 4.8 EBITDAR growth rate in years 1-2 reduced to 1% 5.0 No growth in EBITDAR growth rate in years 1-2 5.2 1 percentage point increase to the discount rates 0.1 2 percentage point increase to the discount rates 0.1 5 percentage point increase to the discount rates 0.7 For CGUs which are still in a rapid growth phase and include significant rental cash flows in addition to the cinema cash flows, specific local factors should be considered when preparing the forecast admissions which differ from a constant future growth rate.
Therefore the basic sensitivities highlighted above are not appropriate to be applied.
As such these CGUs have been excluded from the above analysis and alternative sensitivities, reflecting managements best estimate of likely possible changes, have been applied.
EBITDAR is particularly sensitive to a change in admissions due to its particular growth profile.
As such EBITDAR has been reduced to reflect a 15% reduction in mature admissions and related cash flows.
In assessing the risk associated with these cash flows, discount rates have been increased across the various income streams to reflect the maximum expected variances which are considered realistic in practice.
From the sensitivity analysis performed, including a mix of downsides when applying admissions decrease and discount rate increase, the potential impairment level ranges from headroom of 0.3m to impairment of 5.1m.

However, for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, it is acceptable under IAS 36 to group CGUs, in order to reflect the level at which goodwill is monitored by management.
The ex-Cine-UK, ex-UGC including Dublin and Picturehouse businesses are now fully integrated, meaning that goodwill is now monitored on a UK wide level.
Cinema City CGUs are considered as separate groups and have been tested for goodwill impairment on this basis, the Cinema City CGUs are considered on a territory basis, the territories being Poland 2016: 96.2m, 2015: 85.3m, Israel 2016: 64.4m, 2015: 52.6m, Hungary 2016: 47.9m, 2015: 40.3m, Romania 2016: 99.7m, 2015: 85.8m, Bulgaria 2016: 15.3m, 2015: 13.1m, Czech 2016: 26.6m, 2015: 22.8m and Slovakia 2016: 3.7m, 2015: 3.2m.
The five sites acquired from Empire Cinemas Limited in the year are considered to have been fully integrated from the date of acquisition as there were no support functions included in the acquisition.
The acquired goodwill in respect of this transaction is therefore included within the UK CGU.
The recoverable amount of UK and Cinema City CGUs have been determined based on a value in use calculation.
That calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the first five year period have been extrapolated using the below assumptions.
This growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the market in which the CGU operates.
The UK business has discounted forecast cash flows using a pre-tax discount rate of 9.5% 2014: 11.36% being a market participants discount rate.
The Cinema City CGUs have discounted forecast cash flows using a pre-tax discount rates relevant to the operating territory of each CGU see Note 9, being a market participants discount rate.
This is considered to reflect the risks associated with the relevant cash flows each CGU.
The key assumptions used in the cash flow projections for the purpose of the impairment review are as follows: UK & Ireland ROW Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 2016 2015 % % % % 1 1 Discount rate 9.20 11.36 N A N A EBITDA growth rate from year 5 onward 2.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 1 Individual discount rates for each operating territory have been used, a summary is disclosed in Note 9.

Intangible Assets continued 2017 forecast EBITDA, as defined in Note 1, was used as the basis of the future cash flow calculation.
Management have sensitised the key assumptions in the goodwill impairment tests and underboth the base case and sensitised cases no impairment exists.
The key assumptions used and sensitised were forecast cashflows and the relevant discount rate, which were selected as they are the key variable elements of the value in use.
A reduction of 10% in the forecast cashflows for each CGU from year 2 to 5 or an increase in the discount rate applied to the cashflows of each CGU of 1 percentage point would not cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount for any CGU.
Therefore, management believe that any reasonably possiblechange in the key assumptions would not result in an impairment charge.

15. Business Combinations On 28 July 2016 Cineworld Group Plc the Group announced the acquisition of five Cinemas from Cinema Holdings Limited by means of an acquisition of 100% of the shares, including all of the voting rights.
Consideration transferred The acquisition was completed on 11 August 2016, at which point the consideration equated to 94.5m which would be settled equally in cash, and in Cineworld Group plc ordinary shares in addition to the transfer of the trade and assets of the Groups Haymarket cinema to Cinema Holdings Limited.
The shares will be issued in five instalments during a 12 month period, based on an issue price reflecting 20 days average trading price prior to the date of each issuance.
The first issue of shares took place on 18 November 2016.
Fair Value of Consideration Transferred m Cash consideration 47.0 Share consideration 47.0 Transfer of cinema assets 0.5 Total fair value of consideration transferred 94.5 The fair value of the shares issued to Cinema Holdings Limited will include 42.0m split into four tranches, issued at three month intervals with the first issued on the three month anniversary of completion of the acquisition.

Business Combinations continued The Key Judgments considered were as follows: Property and leases The fair value of property, plant and equipment of 42.8m included a number of adjustments.
Old cinema equipment and assets which were previously held at their residual value of 3.2m were fully depreciated as the residual value is not expected to be realised.
A fair value adjustment of 3.0m was made in respect of the Bromley site in recognition of the residual value in the sellers books being below the current market value.
As well as considering the fair value of acquired property, plant and equipment, management also considered the lease contract for each of the cinemas.
Where leases include options to extend beyond the existing contracted term this was taken into consideration.
Two leases held on the Leicester Square site were classified as finance leases and a liability for the fair value of the minimum expected lease payments on each recognized, a corresponding asset was recognised in respect of the fair value of the lease within Property, Plant and Equipment.
Tax The acquired deferred tax liability of 0.2m reflects taxable temporary differences on fixed assets at acquisition.
No income tax liability is recognised on acquisition as future tax charges are not expected to arise in respect of tax positions open at the date of acquisition.
Identifiable Intangible Assets There were no identifiable intangible assets recognised on acquisition.
Management consider the residual Goodwill of 60.6m to represent a number of factors including the strategic location of the sites acquired, the established benefit of an established site, the value the acquired sites can add to Cineworlds existing brand and products as well as synergies expected to be realised post acquisition.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The revenue included in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss since 11 August 2016 contributed by the acquired sites was 11.9m.
The profit before tax contributed was 2.6m over the same period.
Had the five cinemas been consolidated from 1 January 2016 the commencement of the current financial period, the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss would show revenue of 814.5m and profit before tax of 101.9m.
Acquisition related costs of 0.5m were charged to administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss for the year ended 31 December 2016.

Employee Benefits Pension Plans The Group operates two externally funded defined benefit pension schemes, one in the United Kingdom, the MGM Pension Scheme, and one in Ireland, the Adelphi-Carlton Limited Contributory Pension Plan.
MGM Scheme The Scheme is a funded scheme of the defined benefit type, providing retirement benefits based on final salary.
The Scheme closed to future accrual from 31 May 2009, though the link to final pay at retirement was retained.
On 15 December 2016 the scheme was bought out by Aviva Annuity UK Limited, with all risks in relation to the scheme passing to Aviva Annuity UK Limited as of the buyout date.
This transition was treated as a settlement occurring on 15 December 2016 the inception date.
Following this transaction, all members of the Scheme have had their benefits secured with Aviva Annuity UK Limited, discharging the Groups legal and constructive obligations for the scheme.
The past service liabilities at 31 December 2016 are therefore shown as nil.
The Group has engaged its actuarys assistance in measuring the defined benefit asset for the purposes of IAS19 revised for the year ended 31 December 2016 as well as at the buyout date.
The valuation used for IAS19 disclosures has been based on a full assessment of the liabilities of the Scheme as at 5 April 2015.
The present values of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and any past service costs were measured using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses up to the date of the buyout were recognised in the year in which they occurred, but outside the Statement of Profit or Loss, through Other Comprehensive Income.
The Group made contributions of 0.8m during 2016 2015: 1.6m.
The net surplus deficit in the pension scheme is: 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 m m MGM Pension Scheme 10.5 Net surplus 10.5 Following the buyout transaction there is no asset or liability recognised in respect of the fair value of the scheme, 1.6m is recognised within other receivables in respect of the amount due to the Group from the settlement of the scheme.

Funding Requirements UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently.
The last funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 5 April 2015 and showed a surplus of 1.7m.
The Group paid deficit contributions of 0.8m in 2016 to support the scheme, following the buyout transaction no further contribution in respect of the scheme are expected.
Risks Associated with the Scheme Following the buyout transaction all of the risks in respect of the scheme have been transferred to Aviva Annuity UK Limited.
Prior to settlement, the Scheme exposed the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are: Asset Volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit.
The Scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets equity diversified growth funds and global absolute return fund which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the Schemes long-term objectives.
Changes in Bond Yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Schemes liabilities for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes bond holdings.
Inflation Risk A significant proportion of the Schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life Expectancy The majority of the Schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
A contingent liability previously existed in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP.
The UK Government intends to implement legislation which could result in an increase in the value of GMP for males.
This would increase the defined benefit obligation of the plan.
At this stage, it is not possible to quantify the impact of this change.
The buyout premium paid includes an estimated additional cost for GMP equalisation and this cost is therefore included in the settlement recorded through the Statement of Profit or Loss.
The amounts recognised on the Balance Sheet are set out below: 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 m m Present value of funded defined benefit obligations 31.0 Fair value of plan assets 41.5 Surplus in scheme 10.5 When the members benefits have been fully paid, the rules of the scheme permit any surplus to revert to the employer the Group.
Therefore the surplus on the scheme has been recognised as an asset.
The fair value of plan asset remaining at 31 December 2016 represent the residual balance following settlement of the scheme and all risks and obligations transferring to Aviva Annuity UK Limited, it is expected that these assets will transfer to the Group on completion of the buyout process.

Defined Contribution Plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans.
The total expense relating to these plans in the current year was 0.3m 2015: 0.6m.
There was nil accruing to these pension schemes as at 31 December 2016 2015: 0.1m.
Accrued Employee Retirement Rights Local applicable labour laws and agreements in the ROW require certain Group companies to pay severance pay to dismissed or retiring employees including those leaving their employment under certain other circumstances.
The calculation of the severancepay liability has been made in accordance with labour agreements in force and based on salary components that, in managements opinion, create entitlement to severance pay.
Group companies severance pay liabilities to their employees are funded partially by regular deposits with recognised pension and severance pay funds in the employees names and by purchase of insurance policies.
They are accounted for as if they were a defined contribution plan.
The amounts funded as above are netted against the related liabilities and are not reflected in the Balance Sheet since they are not under the control and management of the companies.
The amounts of the liability for severance pay presented in the Balance Sheet see below reflect that part of the liability not covered by the funds and the insurance policies mentioned above, as well as the liability that is funded by deposits withrecognised central severance pay funds held under the name of the Companys subsidiaries.
The cost of severance provision is determined according to the projected unit credit method.
It has been calculated using a discounted cash flow approach.
The calculations are based on the following assumptions: Discount at 31 December 2016 1.73%.
Expected returns on plan assets at 31 December 2016 1.02%.

Thetrustees of the Adelphi-Carlton Contributory Pension Plan have not agreed that any surplus on the plan can be refunded tothe Group.
Accordingly the surplus has not been recognised.
The Scheme has a surplus of 0.3m as at 31 December 2016 2015:0.6m.
Actuaries for Adelphi-Carlton Limited carried out the last actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 1 April 2016.
Based on this assessment, the actuarial value of the assets of the scheme was more than sufficient to cover 100% of the benefits that had accrued to members.
In view of this, a suspension of Group contributions was in force from 1 April 2001 to 31 December 2016.
Totalcontributions for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 were nil and nil, respectively.
No contributions are expected for the year ended 31 December 2016.
Share-Based Payments As at 31 December 2016 there were three types of share option and share schemes: theCineworld Group 2007 Performance Share Plan, the Cineworld Group plc Company Share Option Plan and the Cineworld Group 2007 Sharesave Scheme.

Employee Benefits continued Single Total Figure Table audited information The table below gives a single figure for the total remuneration for each Director for the period.
2 Under the ShareSave Scheme, employees are able to acquire shares in the Company at a discount of up to 20% of the market value at grant.
The figures in this table relate to the value of this discount at the date of grant.
3 The gain on PSP shares vesting in respect of the period has been calculated using a share price of 5.525, being the average price for the last three months of the period as PSP will not vest until 6 June 2017, and includes payment of a cash sum equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares in respect of dividend record dates occurring between grant and vesting.
Currently, the dividend equivalent payment to Moshe Greidinger would amount to 101,604, the dividend equivalent payment to Israel Greidinger would amount to 69,276, and the dividend equivalent payment to Philip Bowcock would amount to 32,256.
4 Philip Bowcock left the Company on 31 October 2015, Stephen Wiener left the Company on 31 March 2014, Peter Williams left the Company on 26 May 2015, and David Maloney left the Company on 26 May 2015.
5 Details of the actual gain made are set out on page 71.
The actual figures set out in the table above differ from those included in the 2015 Annual Report figures as last year an estimated value of 5.58 a share was used to calculate the theoretical gain, as the awards had not yet vested.
The figures above reflect the share price of 5.10 on the date of vesting, 15 March 2016.
6 Philip Bowcock left the Company on 31 October 2015 and this figure includes two months salary paid in lieu of notice amounting to 62,500.

Property provisions relate to onerous leases, dilapidations, market rent adjustments and other property liabilities.
Market rent provisions relate to the fair value of liabilities on leases acquired, which are assessed on acquisition and released over the remaining life of the lease.
The property provision includes onerous leases, which are assessed asbeing the unavoidable costs of the lease obligations in excess of the economic benefits expected to be received from operating it.
The unavoidable costs of the lease reflect the lease net cost of exiting from the contract and is measured as the lower of the net cost of continuing to operate the lease and any penalties or other costs from exiting it, measured on a discounted basis.
The remaining provision will be utilised over the period to the next rent review date or the remaining lease life depending on the term of the lease.

Merger Reserve In accordance with section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, the premium on ordinary shares issued in relation to acquisitions is recorded as a merger reserve.
Hedging Reserve The hedging reserve comprises the liability in relation to the interest rate swaps entered into, to hedge against variable interest payments on 147.5m 2015: 119.0m of the total 322.9m 2015: 300.3m of bank debt.
As hedge accounting has been adopted the gains losses are recorded through equity until such time as the cash flows being hedged occur, when they are recycled to the statement of profit or loss.
During 2016 a 1.9m gain was recycled through the Statement of Profit or Loss in respect of the fair value of cash flow hedges on loans settled during the year.
A foreign currency exposure arises from the Groups net investment in its Dutch subsidiary, which has a Euro functional currency.
The risk arises from fluctuations in exchange rates between the Pound and the Euro, which cause the value of the net investment to vary.
The Group hedges part of its exposure to changes in the value of the investment arising from variances in Euro to Pound exchange rate.
The hedge is designated against the Groups Euro term loan and 54.0m of the investment in the Dutch subsidiary.
The loan is designated as the hedging instrument for the changes in value that is attributable to the GBP EURO spot rate.
The Group assesses effectiveness by comparing changes in the carrying amount of the debt that is attributable to a change in spot rate with changes in the value of the investment in the foreign operation due to movements in the spot rate.
The Groups policy is to hedge the net investment only to the extent of the debt principal.
The changes in fair value of the hedged item and instrument were reflected in the table were recognised in the hedge and foreign exchange reserve respectively for the hedged item and hedging instrument.

Financial Instruments Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Group has in place a risk management programme and regular reports are made to the Audit Committee, which is tasked withgeneral oversight.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles andobligations.
The Groups Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks by the Group.
The Groups Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit.
Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of certain risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
However, due to the nature of the Groups business, trade receivables are not significant which limits the related credit risk.
The Groups trade receivables are disclosed in Note 14.
Of the total balance of 29.8m 2015: 23.5m due 75% 2015: 83% are within credit terms.
The bad debt provision as at 2016 is Nil 2015:306,000, with a bad debt expense in the year of Nil 2015: nil.
Based on past experience the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of the trade receivables that are past due.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is also limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of nettingagreements.
The amounts disclosed in the table are contractual undiscounted cash flows, including interest payments calculated using interest rates in force at each Balance Sheet date, so will not always reconcile with the amounts disclosed on the Balance Sheet.

The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current facility for at least 12 months from the approval date of the financial statements, including compliance with the bank facility covenants.
Cash Flow Hedges The following table indicates the periods in which the discounted cash flows associated with derivatives that are cash flow hedges are expected to occur.

Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Foreign Currency Risk Operating across nine territories increases the Groups exposure to currency risk.
Wherever possible, overseas operations will fund their day-to-day working capital requirements in local currency with cash generated from operations, naturally hedging the currency risk exposure to the Group.
Management will continually monitor the level of currency risk exposure, and consider hedging whereappropriate.
Currently the Group considers the currency risk on consolidation of the assetsand liabilities of its foreign entities to be of low materiality and no hedging has been undertaken.
Interest Rate Risk The Groups policy is to manage its cost of borrowing by securing fixed interest rates on a portion of its term loan.
Whilst fixed-rate interest-bearing debt is not exposed to cash flow interest rate risk, there is no opportunity for the Group to enjoya reduction in borrowing costs in markets where rates are falling.
In addition, the fair value risk inherent in fixed-rate borrowing means that the Group is exposed to unplanned costs should debt berestructured or repaid early as part of the liquidity management process.
The Group uses interest rate swaps agreed with other parties to hedge a portion of its bank loans that have fixed interest rates.
Interest rate swaps are measured at fair value, which have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The Group has hedging arrangements in place to mitigate the potential risk of a material impact arising from interest rate fluctuations.
At 31 December 2016, the Group had seven 2015: six interest rate swaps, four GBP denominated swaps which hedged 80% 2015: 82% of the Groups variable rate GBP unsecured term loan and, the three remaining Euro denominated swaps hedging 100% 2015:100% of the Euro denominated unsecured loan.
The revolver loan, of which 158.0m 2015: 130.0m was drawn down at the end of the year, is not hedged.
At the year end the Group had six 2015 year end: six interest rate swaps which hedged 100% 2015: 100% of the Groups variable rate unsecured Euro denominated term loan and 82% 2015: 59% of the sterling denominated term loan.
As a result, there is no impact on the statement of profit or loss relating to the hedged bank debt as a result of any changes in interest rates.

Fair Value Sensitivity Analysis for Fixed Rate Instruments The Group accounts for fixed-rate derivative financial instruments interest rate swaps at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit or Loss except where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting when recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
Hedge accounting was adopted from the year ended 27 December 2007 on the swap taken out in May 2007.
A change of 100 basis points in interest rates would have increased equity by 1.6m 2015: 1.9m or decreased equity by 1.6m 2015: 1.9m for each swap and would have increased or decreased profit or loss by nil 2015: nil.
Cash Flow Sensitivity Analysis for Variable Rate Instruments A change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss bythe amounts shown below.
