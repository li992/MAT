Consideration of employee remuneration and shareholders All-employee remuneration In setting the remuneration policy for Directors, the pay and conditions of other employees are taken into account, including any base salary increases awarded.
The Committee is provided with data on the remuneration structure for management level tiers below the Executive Directors, and uses this information to ensure consistency of approach throughout the Group.
The Committee has not expressly sought the views of employees and no remuneration comparison measurements were used when drawing up the Directors Remuneration Policy.
Through the Board, however, the Committee is updated as to employee views on remuneration generally.
See page 54 for the Companys general approach to employee remuneration.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee has an open relationship with shareholders on remuneration matters.
It welcomes dialogue and will engage with significant shareholders on material changes to its remuneration policy or structure.
During the acquisition of bwin.
party, we consulted with shareholders on, amongst other aspects, the remuneration arrangements of the Executive Directors.
It should be noted that the 2015 LTIP was separately approved by shareholders with a strong level of support as part of the acquisition of bwin.
