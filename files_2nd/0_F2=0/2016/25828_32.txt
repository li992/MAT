Taxation continued c Deferred taxation The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 10,108,000 2015: 9,740,000 based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 18% 2015: 20%.
The UK Government announced in July 2015 that the corporation tax rate is set to be cut to 19% in 2017 and 18% in 2020.
These reductions in the standard rate of corporation tax were substantively enacted on 26th October 2015 and became effective from 18th November 2015.
The deferred tax asset has arisen due to the cumulative excess of deductible expenses over taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future and therefore no asset has been recognised in the financial statements.
Given the Companys status as an investment trust company and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
