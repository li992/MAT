Recognition and measurement Provisions are recognised by the Group when: there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is more likely than not that a permanent outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: the amount can be reliably estimated and measured at the present value of managements best estimate of the cash outflow required to settle the obligation at reporting date.
Provision Description Employee benefits Liabilities for annual leave and any accumulating sick leave accrued up until the reporting date that are expected to be settled within 12 months are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.
Liabilities for long service leave are measured as the present value of estimated future payments for the services provided by employees up to the reporting date and disclosed within employee benefits.
Liabilities that are not expected to be settled within 12 months are discounted at the reporting date using market yields of high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds for countries where there is no deep market for corporate bonds.
The rates used reflect the terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.
In relation to industry-based long service leave funds, the Groups liability, including obligations for funding shortfalls, is determined after deducting the fair value of dedicated assets of such funds.
Liabilities for unpaid wages and salaries are recognised in other creditors.
Restructuring Restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan identifying the business or part of the business concerned, the location and approximate number of employees affected, a detailed estimate of the associated costs, and an appropriate timeline: and the restructuring has either commenced or been publicly announced and can no longer be withdrawn.
Payments falling due greater than 12 months after the reporting date are discounted to present value.
