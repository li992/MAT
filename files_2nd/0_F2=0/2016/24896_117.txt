Deferred income represents revenue where an obligation exists to provide future services.
An appropriate proportion of monies received in advance is treated as deferred income and recognised over the relevant period.
Other creditors mainly represent those amounts to be collected from policyholders but to be remitted to third parties for obligations such as the cost of underwriting and Insurance Premium Tax.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates their fair value.
