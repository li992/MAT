terms, known as the International Commercial terms Incoterms.
As the transfer of risks and rewards generally coincides with the transfer of control at a point in time for the Incoterms as part of the Groups commodity sales arrangements, the timing and amount of revenue recognised for the sale of commodities is unlikely to be materially affected for the majority of sales.
IFRS 15 introduces the concept of performance obligations that are defined as a distinct promised good or service.
For the Incoterms Cost, Insurance and Freight CIF and Cost and Freight CFR the seller must contract for and pay the costs and freight necessary to bring the goods to the named port of destination.
Consequently, the freight service on export commodity contracts with CIF CFR Incoterms represents a separate performance obligation as defined under the new standard.
This means that, where material, a portion of the revenue earned under these contracts, representing the obligation to perform the freight service, will be deferred and recognised over time as this obligation is fulfilled, along with the associated costs.
Based upon the preliminary assessment performed, the impact of this change on the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a year is not expected to be material.

SEGMENTAL INFORMATION The Groups segments are aligned to those business units that are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The Kumba Iron Ore, Iron Ore Brazil and Samancor business units have been aggregated as the Iron Ore and Manganese segment on the basis of the ultimate product produced ferrous metals.
The Corporate and other segment includes unallocated corporate costs, exploration costs and the Other Mining and Industrial business unit, the majority of whose remaining operations were disposed of in the year ended 31 December 2015.
Exploration costs represent the cost of the Groups exploration activities across all segments.
Segments predominantly derive revenue as follows DeBeers: rough and polished diamonds: Platinum: platinum group metals: Copper: copper: Nickel: nickel: Niobium and Phosphates: niobium and phosphates: Iron Ore and Manganese: iron ore, manganese ore and alloys: Coal: metallurgical coal and thermal coal.

Niobium and Phosphates was sold on 30 September 2016 see note 30.
During the year, Anglo American Platinum Limited has identified certain computational errors affecting its results reported in prior periods, the impact of which is considered material to Anglo American Platinum Limited but is not material to the Group.
Consequently, the affected prior period results have been restated in the individual financial statements of Anglo American Platinum Limited but have been corrected in the current year in the Group financial statements.
Had the Group results been restated, underlying EBIT and underlying EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2016 would be higher by $77million 2015: underlying EBIT lower by $21 million and underlying EBITDA lower by $10 million.
The segment results are stated after elimination of inter-segment transactions and include an allocation of corporate costs.

SPECIAL ITEMS AND REMEASUREMENTS Special Items Special items are those items of financial performance that, due to their size and nature, the Group believes should be separately disclosed on the face of the income statement.
These items, along with related tax and non-controlling interest, are excluded from underlying earnings, which is an Alternative Performance Measure APM.
Operating special items are those that relate to the operating performance of the Group and principally include impairment charges and restructuring costs.
Non-operating special items are those that relate to changes in the Groups asset portfolio.
This category principally includes profits and losses on disposal of businesses and investments or closure of operations, adjustments relating to business combinations, and adjustments relating to former operations of the Group, such as changes in the measurement of deferred consideration receivable or provisions recognised on disposal or closure of operations in prior periods.
This category also includes charges relating to Black Economic Empowerment BEE transactions.
Financing special items are those that relate to financing activities and include realised gains and losses on early repayment of borrowings, and the unwinding of the discount on material provisions previously recognised as special items.
Remeasurements Remeasurements are items that are excluded from underlying earnings in order to reverse timing differences in the recognition of gains and losses in the income statement in relation to transactions that, whilst economically linked, are subject to different accounting measurement or recognition criteria.
Remeasurements include mark-to-market movements on derivatives that are economic hedges of transactions not yet recorded in the financial statements, inorder to ensure that the overall economic impact of such transactions is reflected within the Groups underlying earnings in the period in which they occur.
When the underlying transaction is recorded in the income statement, the realised gains or losses are reversed from remeasurements and are recorded in underlying earnings.
If the underlying transaction is recorded in the balance sheet, for example capital expenditure, the realised amount remains in remeasurements on settlement of the derivative.
Operating remeasurements include unrealised gains and losses on derivatives relating to revenue, operating profit or capital expenditure transactions.
They also include the fair value gain or loss, and its subsequent reversal through depreciation and amortisation, arising on revaluation of a previously held equity interest in a business combination.
Financing remeasurements include unrealised gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities that represent economic hedges, including accounting hedges, related to financing arrangements.
Tax remeasurements include foreign exchange impacts arising in US dollar functional currency entities where tax calculations are generated based on local currency financial information and hence deferred tax is susceptible to currency fluctuations.

Operating special items Impairments Coal Moranbah North and Grosvenor are adjacent longwall metallurgical coal operations in Queensland, Australia, sharing infrastructure and processing facilities.
The two operations are assessed for impairment as a single cash generating unit CGU.
In the first half of 2016 the Groups expectations for long-term metallurgical coal prices were revised downward.
Consequently, an impairment of $1,248million $1,248 million after tax against the value of the operations was reported in the Groups 2016 interim results, based on a recoverable amount of $1.6 billion at 30 June 2016.
The valuation was based on the fair value less costs of disposal of the CGU, measured using discounted cash flow projections see note 1.
The valuation is sensitive to changes in assumptions about future metallurgical coal prices, which are subject to a high level of estimation uncertainty.
For example, a $5 tonne change in the long-term price forecast for hard coking coal, with all other valuation assumptions remaining the same, would change the valuation by $0.2 billion.
The valuation also incorporates assumptions about future production at Grosvenor, which is still ramping up and has encountered challenging geological conditions in the latter part of 2016.
Changes in these assumptions could result in further impairments or impairment reversals.
Other coal impairments of $64 million $46 million after tax relate to assets in Coal South Africa that are no longer expected to provide future economic benefits due to changes in the Life of Mine Plans across the export portfolio during the year.
El Soldado An impairment charge of $200 million $120 million after tax has been recorded in relation to El Soldado Copper which is no longer expected to provide future economic benefits as a result of licensing uncertainty following changes made to sequencing in response to low prices during 2016.
128 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 Financial statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT 6.
SPECIAL ITEMS AND REMEASUREMENTS continued Minas-Rio The Minas-Rio iron ore project Minas-Rio Iron Ore and Manganese in Brazil was acquired in two separate transactions in 2007 and 2008.
Prior to 2016, impairment charges totalling $11.3 billion before tax were recorded against the carrying value of Minas-Rio.
The valuation was reassessed as at 31December 2016 and the recoverable amount was considered to be in line with the carrying value of $4.3 billion.
The valuation remains sensitive to economic and operational factors that provide both upside and downside risk, including price and the scheduling of required permits and licences.
For example, a $5 tonne change in the long-term price forecast for iron ore, with all other valuation assumptions remaining the same, would change the valuation by$0.7 billion.
Sishen The Sishen iron ore mine is located in the Northern Cape Province in South Africa.
In the year ended 31 December 2015 the operation was impaired by $514million based on a recoverable amount of $1.3 billion.
The valuation was reassessed as at 31 December 2016 and the recoverable amount was considered to be in line with the carrying value of $1.4 billion.
The valuation remains sensitive to economic and operational assumptions, particularly price.
Forexample, a $5 tonne change in the long-term price forecast for iron ore, with all other valuation assumptions remaining the same, would change the valuation by $0.3 billion.
Restructuring costs Restructuring costs of $120 million before tax relate to organisational changes as part of the Driving Value programme.
The programme has incurred costs between 2014 and 2016 and constitutes a single strategic restructuring to effect permanent change to the Groups organisational structure.
Restructuring costs in 2015 were $148 million $106 million after tax and non-controlling interests.
2015 In 2015 operating special items principally related to impairments of Minas-Rio, Coal assets, Platinum assets, Snap Lake, Sishen and El Soldado.
Total pre-tax impairments were $5,824 million $4,894 million after tax and non-controlling interests.
Operating remeasurements Operating remeasurements reflect a net loss of $33 million $25 million after tax and non-controlling interests which principally relates to a $101 million depreciation and amortisation charge arising due to the fair value uplift on the Groups pre-existing 45% shareholding in fide Beers, which was required on acquisition of a controlling stake, and gains on derivatives of $68 million mostly related to economic hedges of capital expenditure in Iron Ore Brazil.
In 2015 operating remeasurements reflected a net loss before tax of $178 million $125 million after tax and non-controlling interests.
Non-operating special items Disposals of businesses and investments The gain on disposal of $1,157 million principally comprises net gains on disposal of subsidiaries and joint operations of $977 million, which relate to the disposals of Callide gain of $564 million, Niobium and Phosphates gain of $460 million, Rustenburg loss of $121 million, Foxleigh gain of $42 million andMorupule gain of $32 million.
Further details of disposals are provided in note 30.
In addition, a net gain of $180 million $145 million after tax realised on disposal of the Groups 9.7% interest in Exxaro Resources Limited Exxaro on 1December 2016 for net proceeds of $215 million.
Adjustments relating to business combinations Contingent liabilities that were required to be recognised at fair value on acquisition of fide Beers in 2012, have been derecognised as the legal proceedings inrespect of these matters have been closed.
This has resulted in a pre-tax gain of $121 million $82 million after tax and non-controlling interests.
Charges relating to BEE transactions Charges relating to BEE transactions of $63 million $36 million after tax and non-controlling interests include a charge of $24 million relating to the repurchase by fide Beers of shares in Ponahalo Holdings Limited awarded to certain employees and their dependants as part of DBCMs 2006 empowerment transaction, and a charge of $39 million relating to the Kumba Envision Trust, which was Kumbas broad based employee share scheme provided solely for the benefit of non-managerial Historically Disadvantaged South African employees who did not participate in other Kumba share schemes.
Adjustments relating to former operations The net loss of $12 million includes amounts contributed to the Q h ubeka Trust pursuant to the agreement reached in March 2016 by Anglo American South Africa AASA and AngloGold Ashanti which resolved fully and finally 4,400 stand-alone silicosis claims.
The settlement was reached without admission of liability by AASA or AngloGold Ashanti.
2015 Non-operating special items in 2015 principally relate to the write-down to fair value of Rustenburg, the loss on disposal of Anglo American Norte S. A. and the loss on disposal of interests in Tarmac businesses.
The total charge was $1,278 million $1,063 million after tax and non-controlling interests.
Financing special items and remeasurements Financing special items and remeasurements reflect a net loss of $314 million 2015: net gain of $615 million and $318 million after tax and non-controlling interests 2015: net gain of $668 million after tax and non-controlling interests.
Financing special items and remeasurements principally comprise a net fair value loss of $389 million on derivatives hedging net debt and a net gain of $120million resulting from the bond buybacks completed in the year.
Of the fair value losses on derivatives, a loss of $482million relates to the reduction inthedebit valuation adjustment on derivatives hedging net debt.
This adjustment is incorporated into the valuation of these derivatives to reflect the impact on the fair value of Anglo Americans own credit quality.
The loss principally reflects the reduction in Anglo Americans observed credit spreads since 31December 2015.
Tax associated with special items and remeasurements Total tax relating to subsidiaries and joint operations amounts to a credit of $44 million 2015: credit of $47 million.
This includes one-off tax charges of $76 million 2015: charges of $829 million, tax credits on special items and remeasurements of $46 million 2015:credits of $769 million and tax remeasurement credits of $74 million 2015: credits of $107 million.
Of the total tax credit of $44 million, $129 million relates to a current tax charge 2015: charge of $55 million and $173 million relates to a deferred tax credit 2015: credit of $102 million.

This is partially offset by an amount included within prior year adjustments of $200 million.
2 The special items and remeasurements reconciling item of $111 million 2015: $1,333 million relates to the net tax impact of total special items and remeasurements before tax calculated atthe United Kingdom corporation tax rate less the associated tax recorded against these items, one-off tax charges and tax remeasurements.
See note 6 for further details of the tax amounts included within special items and remeasurements.
IAS 1 requires income from associates and joint ventures to be presented net of tax on the face of the income statement.
Associates and joint ventures tax is therefore excluded from the Groups income tax expense.
Associates and joint ventures tax included within Share of net income loss from associates and joint ventures for the year ended 31 December 2016 is a charge of $117million 2015:charge of $143million.
Excluding special items and remeasurements this becomes a charge of $123million 2015: charge of $100 million.
The underlying effective tax rate was 24.6% for the year ended 31December 2016.
This is lower than the equivalent underlying effective tax rate of 31.0% for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The decreased rate in 2016 was due to a benefit received in relation to the reassessment of withholding tax provisions, and the utilisation of losses and other tax attributes not previously recognised, partially offset by the impact of enhanced tax depreciation and other prior year adjustments.
In future periods it is expected that the underlying effective tax rate will remain above the United Kingdom statutory tax rate.

The allocation of goodwill to CGUs or groups ofCGUs is as follows: US$ million 2016 2015 fide Beers 1,604 1,553 Platinum 189 189 Copper 124 124 Coal South Africa 88 88 Other 9 216 2,014 2,170 For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the recoverable amount of each of the CGUs or group of CGUs has been determined based on a fair value less costs of disposal basis.
The key assumptions used in determining fair value less costs of disposal are set out in note 1.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in a key assumption on which the recoverable amounts are based would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed their recoverable amounts.

The write-down of inventories net of revaluation of provisionally priced purchases amounted to $96 million 2015: $121 million.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES Trade receivables do not incur any interest, are principally short term in nature and are measured at their nominal value with the exception of receivables relating to provisionally priced sales, as set out in the revenue recognition accounting policy, see note 39a, net of appropriate provision for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Such provisions are raised based on an assessment of debtor ageing, past experience or known customer circumstances.

The overdue debtor ageing profile is typical of the industry in which certain of the Groups businesses operate.
Given this, theuse of payment security instruments including letters of credit from acceptable financial institutions, and the nature of the related counterparties, these amounts areconsidered recoverable.
The historical level of customer default is minimal and as a result the credit quality of year end trade receivables is considered to be high.
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES Trade payables are not interest bearing and are measured at their nominal value with the exception of payables relating to provisionally priced commodity purchases which are marked to market using the appropriate forward price until settled.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS See notes 39l, 39m and 39n for the Groups accounting policies on financial asset investments, impairment of financial assets, derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities are as shown below.
Where the carrying amount of a financial asset or liability does not approximate itsfair value, this is also disclosed.
For financial assets and liabilities which are traded on an active market, such as listed investments or listed debt instruments, fair value is determined by reference to market value.
For non-traded financial assets and liabilities, fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows, considered to be reasonable and consistent with those that would be used by a market participant, and based on observable market data where available, unless carrying value is considered to approximate fair value.
All derivatives that have been designated into hedge relationships have been separately disclosed.

Trade and other payables exclude tax and social security and deferred income.
2 Borrowings designated in fair value hedges represent listed debt which is held at amortised cost, adjusted for the fair value of the hedged interest rate risk.
The fair value of these borrowings is $12,405 million 2015: $10,898 million, which is measured using quoted indicative broker prices and consequently categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The carrying value of the remaining borrowings at amortised cost of $832 million, principally comprising bank borrowings, is considered to approximate the fair value.
At 31 December 2015 the fair value of borrowings at amortised cost of $3,167 million, principally comprising bank borrowings, was $2,463 million.
The difference between the carrying value and the fair value primarily reflected the debit valuation adjustment of Anglo Americans own credit quality based on observed credit spreads at 31 December 2015.

This category includes listed equity shares.
2 Instruments in this category are valued using valuation techniques where all of the inputs that have a significant effect onthe valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
3 Instruments in this category have been valued using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation is not based on observable market data.
Where inputs can be observed from market data without undue cost and effort, the observed input is used.
Otherwise, management determines a reasonable estimate for the input.
This category includes deferred contingent consideration.
4 The debit valuation adjustment is recorded to reflect in the fair value of financial liabilities the effect of Anglo Americans own credit quality based on observed credit spreads.
This adjustment iscalculated in total for each counterparty based on the net expected exposure.
In many cases this includes exposures on a number of different types of derivative instruments.
Consequently the impact of this adjustment has been presented as a separate item within the analysis of derivatives above.
Based on an allocation weighted by exposure to each category of instrument, $73million 2015: $555million is attributable to derivatives hedging net debt and nil 2015: $12 million relates to other derivatives.
Financial assets and liabilities included within level 3 primarily consist of contingent proceeds and receivables relating to disposals and unlisted equity investments.
The movements in the fair value of the level 3 financial assets and liabilities are shown as follows: Assets Liabilities US$ million 2016 2015 2016 2015 At 1 January 109 207 555 499 1 Net loss profit recorded in the income statement 3 75 39 90 Net profit loss recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 31 15 Additions 131 136 Settlement 526 34 Currency movements 2 8 1 At 31 December 270 109 125 555 1 This is principally recorded in special items and remeasurements.
For the level 3 financial assets and liabilities, changing certain estimated inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions does not change the fair value significantly.

DERIVATIVES See note 39n for the Groups accounting policy on derivatives.
The fair values of derivatives are separately recorded on the Consolidated balance sheet within Derivative financial assets and Derivative financial liabilities.
Derivatives are classified as current or non-current depending on the contracted maturity of the derivative.
The Group utilises derivative instruments to manage certain market risk exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes, however it may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes.
Such derivatives are classified as Held for trading and fair value movements are recorded in the Consolidated income statement.
The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits and the positions are regularly monitored and reported to senior management.
Cash flow hedges In certain cases the Group classifies its forward foreign currency contracts, which hedge highly probable forecast transactions, as cash flow hedges.
Where this designation is documented, changes in fair value are recognised in equity until the hedged transactions occur, at which time the respective gains or losses are transferred to the Consolidated income statement or hedged balance sheet item.
Fair value hedges The majority of interest rate swaps taken out to swap the Groups fixed rate borrowings to floating rate, in accordance with the Groups policy have been designated as fair value hedges.
The carrying value of the hedged debt is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the impact on its fair value of changes in market interest rates.
Changes in the fair value of the hedged debt are offset against fair value changes in the interest rate swap and recognised in the Consolidated income statement as financing remeasurements.
Held for trading The Group may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges.
This may occur where the Group is economically hedged but IAS 39 hedge accounting cannot be achieved or where gains and losses on both the derivative and hedged item naturally offset in the Consolidated income statement, as is the case for certain cross currency swaps of non-US dollar debt.
Fair value changes on these derivatives are recognised in the Consolidated income statement as remeasurements or within underlying earnings in accordance with the policy set out in note 6.
The fair value of the Groups open derivative positions at 31 December excluding normal purchase and sale contracts held off balance sheet, recorded within Derivative financial assets and Derivative financial liabilities, is as follows: Current Non-current 2016 2015 2016 2015 US$ million Asset Liability Asset Liability Asset Liability Asset Liability Derivatives hedging net debt 1 Fair value hedge Interest rate swaps 9 23 474 10 454 18 Held for trading Forward foreign currency contracts 10 9 628 10 Cross currency swaps 178 14 430 1,665 3 2,502 Debit valuation adjustment to derivative 2 liabilities 1 19 72 536 19 186 665 421 474 1,603 457 1,984 3 Other derivatives 90 86 24 56 10 3 2 Total derivatives 109 272 689 477 484 1,603 460 1,986 1 Recognised in the Consolidated income statement is a loss on fair value hedged items of $98 million 2015: $143 million, offset by a gain on fair value hedging instruments of $106million 2015:$146 million.
2 Relates to cross currency swaps see note 18.
3 Other derivatives primarily relate to forward foreign currency contracts hedging capital expenditure, forward commodity contracts and other commodity contracts that are accounted for as Held fortrading.
These marked to market valuations are not predictive of the future value of the hedged position, nor of the future impact on the profit of the Group.
The valuations represent the cost of closing all hedge contracts at 31 December, at market prices and rates available at the time.
The Group is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks.
For more information about these risks and the ways in which the Group manages them see notes 24 and 38.

A provision is recognised for the present value of such costs, based on managements best estimate of the legal and constructive obligations incurred.
Changes in legislation could result in changes in provisions recognised.
It is anticipated that the majority of these costs will be incurred over a period in excess of 20 years.
Decommissioning Provision is made for the present value of costs relating to the decommissioning of plant or other site restoration work.
The pre-tax, real discount rates that have been used in calculating the environmental restoration and decommissioning liabilities as at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, in the principal currencies in which these liabilities are denominated, are as follows: US dollar: 2.1%: South African rand: 4%: Australian dollar: 3%: Chilean peso: 3%: and Brazilian real: 6%.
Employee benefits Provision is made for statutory or contractual employee entitlements including long service leave, annual leave, sickness pay and similar obligations.
It is anticipated that these costs will be incurred when employees choose to take their benefits.
Onerous contracts Provision is made for the present value of certain long-term contracts where the unavoidable cost of meeting the Groups obligations is expected to exceed the benefits to be received.
It is anticipated that these costs will be incurred over a period of up to nine years.
Other Other provisions primarily relate to restructuring costs, indemnities, legal and other claims.
It is anticipated that the majority of these costs will be incurred over a period of up to five years.
Environmental rehabilitation trusts The Group makes contributions to controlled funds that were established to meet the cost of some of its restoration and environmental rehabilitation liabilities, primarily in South Africa.
The funds comprise the following investments: US$ million 2016 2015 Equity 135 115 Bonds 153 121 Cash 65 54 353 290 These assets are primarily denominated in South African rand.
Cash is held in short term fixed deposits or earns interest at floating inter-bank rates.
Bonds earn interest at aweighted average fixed rate of 8.0% 2015: 8.1% for an average period of three years 2015: four years.
Equity investments are recorded at fair value through profit and loss and bonds are recorded at amortised cost.
These funds are not available for the general purposes of the Group.
All income from these assets is reinvested to meet specific environmental obligations.
These obligations are included in provisions stated above.

The amount of deferred tax recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet is as follows: US$ million 2016 2015 Deferred tax assets Tax losses 596 534 Post employment benefits 31 31 Share-based payments 15 10 Enhanced tax depreciation 128 121 1 Other temporary differences 243 218 1,013 914 Deferred tax liabilities Capital allowances in excess of depreciation 2,642 2,080 Fair value adjustments 775 689 Tax losses 27 24 Derivatives 2 Provisions 324 278 Withholding tax 237 510 2 Other temporary differences 217 278 3,520 3,253 1 The deferred tax asset on other temporary differences of $243 million arises primarily as a result of currency movements in deferred tax in US dollar functional currency entities whose tax computations are generated based on local currency financial information.
This is partially offset by an amount related to capital allowances in excess of depreciation.
2 The deferred tax liability on other temporary differences of $217 million arises primarily in relation to deferred stripping costs, partially offset by an amount related to post-employment benefits.
The amount of deferred tax charged credited to the Consolidated income statement is as follows: US$ million 2016 2015 Capital allowances in excess of depreciation 384 123 Fair value adjustments 25 243 Tax losses 48 54 Derivatives 24 87 Provisions 22 163 Withholding tax 163 58 Other temporary differences 111 342 185 150 The Group has the following balances in respect of which no deferred tax asset has been recognised: 2016 2015 Tax Tax Other Tax Tax Other losses losses temporary losses losses temporary US$ million revenue capital differences Total revenue capital differences Total Expiry date Greater than one year, less than five years 575 575 334 334 Greater than five years 3,186 3,186 239 3,398 3,637 No expiry date 2,784 1,051 3,363 7,198 5,580 806 1,547 7,933 3,359 1,051 6,549 10,959 6,153 806 4,945 11,904 No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in joint arrangements where the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with such investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in joint arrangements is represented by the contribution of those investments to the Groups retained earnings and amounted to $17,804million 2015: $15,103 million.

Further details on this adjustment are provided in note 18. c Net debt cash by segment The Groups policy is to hold the majority of its cash and borrowings at the corporate centre.
Business units may from time to time raise borrowings in connection with specific capital projects, and subsidiaries with non-controlling interests have borrowings which are without recourse to the Group.
Other than the impact of South African exchange controls see 23d below, there are no significant restrictions over the Groups ability to access these cash balances or repay these borrowings.
Net debt cash by segment is stated after elimination of inter-segment balances.

BORROWINGS See note 39o for the Groups accounting policy on bank borrowings.
The Group accesses borrowings mostly in capital markets through bonds issued under the Euro Medium Term Note EMTN programme, the South African Domestic Medium Term Note DMTN programme, the Australian Medium Term Note AMTN programme and through accessing the US bond markets.
The Group uses interest rate and cross currency swaps to ensure that the majority of the Groups borrowings are floating rate US dollar denominated.
In March 2016, the Group completed a bond buyback transaction consisting of Euro, Sterling and US dollar denominated bonds with maturities from December 2016 to September 2018.
The Group used $1.7 billion of cash to retire $1.83 billion of contractual repayment obligations including derivatives hedging the bonds.
Related to these assets are borrowings of $61 million 2015: $19 million.
2 In March 2016, 169 million of outstanding value was repaid as part of the bond buyback transaction, the remaining 581 million was repaid on maturity.
3 Outstanding value of bond shown subsequent to bond buyback transaction completed in March 2016.

BORROWINGS continued Liquidity risk The Group ensures that there are sufficient committed loan facilities including refinancing, where necessary in order to meet short term business requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and its holding of cash and cash equivalents, as well as any Group distribution restrictions that exist.
In addition, certain projects may be financed by means of limited recourse project finance, if appropriate.
The expected undiscounted cash flows of the Groups net debt related and other financial liabilities, by remaining contractual maturity, based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date are as follows: 2016 Net debt related financial liabilities Expected Derivatives Other future interest hedging financial US$ million Borrowings payments net debt liabilities Total Amount due for repayment within one year 1,801 466 150 3,164 5,581 Greater than one year, less than two years 1,895 460 556 31 2,942 Greater than two years, less than three years 1,686 350 121 2,157 Greater than three years, less than four years 3,090 268 180 3,538 Greater than four years, less than five years 1,460 153 166 1,779 Greater than five years 2,900 252 374 304 3,830 Total due for repayment after more than one year 11,031 1,483 1,397 335 14,246 Total 12,832 1,949 1,547 3,499 19,827 2015 Net debt related financial liabilities Expected Derivatives Other future interest hedging financial US$ million Borrowings payments net debt liabilities Total Amount due for repayment within one year 1,631 702 232 2,662 5,227 Greater than one year, less than two years 2,617 657 113 3,387 Greater than two years, less than three years 3,067 587 544 4,198 Greater than three years, less than four years 1,871 424 43 2,338 Greater than four years, less than five years 3,508 286 101 3,895 Greater than five years 4,853 459 420 5,732 Total due for repayment after more than one year 15,916 2,413 1,221 19,550 Total 17,547 3,115 1,453 2,662 24,777 The Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December: US$ million 2016 2015 Expiry date 1 Within one year 660 683 Greater than one year, less than two years 1,446 32 Greater than two years, less than three years 1,175 1,110 Greater than three years, less than four years 6,203 192 Greater than four years, less than five years 223 5,862 9,707 7,879 1 Includes undrawn South African rand facilities equivalent to $0.5 billion 2015: $0.5 billion in respect of facilities with a 364 day maturity which roll automatically on a daily basis, unless notice isserved.
In January 2017, the Group retired the $1.05 billion Club facility which was entered into in 2016 in the context of the bond buyback transaction.
This facility was undrawn at 31 December 2016 and is included in the table above within greater than one year, less than two years.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and, with cognisance of forecast future market conditions and structuring, to maintain an optimal capital structure to enable the business to operate effectively.
In order to manage the short and long term capital structure, the Group has a number of options including raising and refinancing debt, adjusting returns to equity shareholders, managing the allocation of capital and divesting non-core assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital using various financial metrics including the ratio of net debt to total capital gearing.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents including derivatives which provide an economic hedge of net debt.
Total capital is calculated as Net assets as shown in the Consolidated balance sheet excluding net debt.
Total capital and gearing are as follows: US$ million 2016 2015 Net assets 24,325 21,342 Net debt including related derivatives note 23 8,487 12,901 Total capital 32,812 34,243 Gearing 25.9% 37.7% Gearing has decreased from 37.7% at 31 December 2015 to 25.9% at 31 December 2016 as net debt has decreased, offset by a decrease in total capital.
Net debt decreased from $12.9billion to $8.5 billion during the year, driven by operating cash inflows and proceeds from asset disposals.

BORROWINGS continued Market risk Market risk is the risk that financial instrument fair values and related cash flows will fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
The Group manages interest rate risks and foreign exchange risks on borrowings and cash with the use of cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps in order to ensure that the majority of borrowings are floating rate US dollar denominated.
The Group does not hedge foreign exchange exposures on rand denominated borrowings in South Africa.
For more information regarding the Groups financial risk management see note 38.

COMMITMENTS See note 39x for the Groups accounting policy on leases.
A commitment is a contractual obligation to make a payment in the future which is not provided for in the balance sheet.
The Group also has purchase obligations relating to take or pay agreements which are legally binding and enforceable.
Capital commitments for subsidiaries and joint operations relating to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment are $1,317 million 2015: $1,168 million, ofwhich 45% 2015: 82% relate to expenditure to be incurred within the next year.
The Groups outstanding commitments relating to take or pay agreements are $14,398 million 2015: $14,928 million, of which 9% 2015: 8% relate to expenditure to be incurred within the next year.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS See note 39t for the Groups accounting policy on retirement benefits.
The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans.
It also operates post employment medical plans, principally inSouth Africa.
Defined contribution plans The defined contribution pension and medical cost represents the actual contributions payable by the Group to the various plans.
The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge in respect of these plans is calculated on thebasis of the contribution payable by the Group in the financial year.
The charge for the year for defined contribution pension plans net of amounts capitalised and special items was $180million 2015: $221 million and for defined contribution medical plans net of amounts capitalised was $64million 2015:$73million.
Defined benefit pension plans and post employment medical plans The Group operates defined benefit pension and medical plans across a number of regions.
The most significant plans are in South Africa and the UnitedKingdom.
A summary of the movements in the net pension plan assets and retirement benefit obligations on the Consolidated balance sheet is as follows: US$ million 2016 2015 Net liability recognised at 1 January 361 889 Net income statement charge 42 60 Remeasurement of net defined benefit obligation 214 290 Employer contributions to funded pension plans 105 118 Benefits paid to unfunded plans 39 24 Disposal of business 2 41 Other 3 12 Currency movements 30 103 Net liability recognised at 31 December 508 361 Amounts recognised as: 1 Defined benefit pension plans in surplus 270 306 Retirement benefit obligation pension plans 377 330 Retirement benefit obligation medical plans 401 337 508 361 1 Included in Other non-current assets on the Consolidated balance sheet.
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are funded.
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group, in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice in the relevant jurisdiction.
The unfunded liabilities are principally in relation totermination indemnity plans in Chile.
The post employment medical plans provide health benefits to retired employees and certain dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain criteria.
The majority of these plans are unfunded and are principally in South Africa.
Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations at least every three years using the projected unit credit method.
The actuaries have updated the valuations to 31 December 2016.
Assumptions are set after consultation with the qualified actuaries.
While management believes the assumptions used are appropriate, achange in the assumptions used would impact the Groups other comprehensive income.
Characteristics and risks of plans The defined benefit plans are exposed to risks such as longevity, investment risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchangerisk.
The weighted average duration of the South African plans is 11 years 2015: 11 years, United Kingdom plans is 19years 2015: 18 years and plans in other regions is 14 years 2015: 14 years.
This represents the average period over which future benefit payments are expected to be made.
Employer contributions are made in accordance with the terms of each plan and may vary from year to year.
Employer contributions made to funded plans inthe year ended 31December 2016 were $105million 2015: $118 million.
In addition $39 million 2015: $24 million of benefits were paid to unfunded plans and $21 million 2015: $23 million of benefits were paid in relation topost employment medical plans.
The Group expects to contribute $108 million toits pension plans and $25million to its post employment medical plans in2017.
The responsibility for the governance of the funded retirement benefit plans, including investment and funding decisions, lies with the Trustees of each scheme.
South Africa The pension plans in South Africa are in surplus, with the asset recognised on the Consolidated balance sheet restricted to the amount in the Employer Surplus Account, being plan assets less plan liabilities less any contingency reserves as recommended by the funds actuaries.
The Employer Surplus Account is the amount that the Group is entitled to by way of refund.
All pension plans in South Africa are closed to new members and the majority of plans are closed to future benefit accrual.
As the plans are in surplus no employer contributions are currently being made.
The Groups provision of anti-retroviral therapy to HIV positive staff does not significantly impact the post employment medical plan liability.
United Kingdom The Group operates funded pension plans in the United Kingdom.
These plans are closed to new members and to the future accrual of benefits.
Certain assets held by the main plans in the United Kingdom are structured to closely match the characteristics of the liabilities through a variety of investment strategies, including the use of interest rate hedging and inflation hedging to manage interest rate risk and inflation rate risk, respectively.
The Group is committed to make payments to certain United Kingdom pension plans under deficit funding plans agreed with the respective Trustees.
Where the present value of the agreed funding payments exceeds the liability in respect of the plans as measured under IFRS, and would therefore, when paid, give rise to a surplus as measured under IFRS, a provision is recognised for any part of that surplus that would not be recoverable.
Any resulting surplus has been assessed to be fully recoverable and as such no provision has been recognised.
148 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 Financial statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION 27.
RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued Other Other pension and post employment medical plans primarily comprise obligations in Chile where legislation requires employers to provide for a termination indemnity, entitling employees to a cash payment made on the termination of an employment contract.
The features of this provision meet the definition of a post employment benefit obligation and consequently an unfunded liability is recognised on the Consolidated balance sheet.
Other plans are in Brazil, Canada and mainland Europe and consist of funded and unfunded pension plans and unfunded medical aid plans.
These plans are not considered to be significant tothe Group.
Actuarial assumptions The principal assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and pension charges and credits are detailed below shown as weighted averages : 2016 2015 South United South United Africa Kingdom Other Africa Kingdom Other Defined benefit pension plans Average discount rate for plan liabilities 9.5% 2.6% 5.5% 10.3% 3.9% 6.8% Average rate of inflation 7.0% 3.3% 3.3% 7.9% 3.1% 3.6% Average rate of increase of pensions in payment 7.0% 3.3% 3.0% 7.9% 3.1% 3.2% Post employment medical plans Average discount rate for plan liabilities 9.4% 2.6% 6.9% 10.3% 3.9% 9.1% Average rate of inflation 7.0% 3.3% 5.2% 7.9% 3.1% 6.9% Expected average increase in healthcare costs 8.8% 7.8% 8.0% 9.6% 7.8% 9.1% Mortality assumptions are determined based on standard mortality tables with adjustments, as appropriate, to reflect experience of conditions locally.
In South Africa, the PA90 tables are used.
The main plans in the United Kingdom use either CMI tables or Club Vita models with plan specific adjustments based onmortality investigations.
Themortality tables used imply that a male or female aged 60 at the balance sheet date has the following future life expectancy shown as weighted averages : Male Female Years 2016 2015 2016 2015 South Africa 19.9 19.8 24.7 24.5 United Kingdom 28.1 28.2 29.8 30.0 Other 21.9 22.8 26.0 27.2 The table below summarises the expected life expectancy from the age of 60 for a male or female aged 45 at the balance sheet date.
When viewed together with the respective life expectancy at age 60 in the table above this indicates the anticipated improvement in life expectancy shown as weighted averages : Male Female Years 2016 2015 2016 2015 South Africa 19.9 19.8 24.7 24.5 United Kingdom 29.9 29.6 32.2 32.0 Other 23.9 25.1 27.9 29.3 Sensitivity analysis Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of pension and medical plan liabilities are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality.
The sensitivity analysis below has been provided by local actuaries on an approximate basis based on changes in the assumptions occurring at the end of the year, assuming that all other assumptions are held constant and the effect of interrelationships is excluded.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS See note 39u for the Groups accounting policy on share-based payments.
During the year ended 31 December 2016 the Group had share-based payment arrangements with employees relating to shares of the Company, the details of which are described in the Remuneration report.
All of these Company schemes, as well as any non-cyclical awards, are equity settled either by award of ordinary shares BSP, LTIP, SIP and Non-cyclical or award of options to acquire ordinary shares SAYE.
The total share-based payment charge relating to Anglo American plc shares for the year is split as follows: US$ million 2016 2015 BSP 100 88 LTIP 49 42 Other schemes 12 5 1 Share-based payment charge relating to Anglo American plc shares 161 135 1 In addition, there are equity settled share-based payment charges of $43 million 2015: $47 million relating to Kumba Iron Ore Limited shares, $28 million 2015: $26 million relating to AngloAmerican Platinum Limited shares and $2 million 2015: nil of other equity settled share-based payment charges.
Certain business units also operate cash settled employee share-based payment schemes.
These schemes had a charge of $2million 2015: $1 million.
Schemes settled by award of ordinary shares The fair value of ordinary shares under the BSP, LTIP and LTIP-ROCE, being the more material schemes, was calculated using the Black Scholes model.
The fair value of shares awarded under the LTIP-TSR scheme was calculated using the Monte Carlo model.
These awards have a contractual life of three years and areconditional on three years continuous employment.
The LTIP-ROCE and LTIP-TSR awards are conditional on a Group ROCE target and market based performance conditions, respectively, being achieved.
The following assumptions were used in the valuation of the awards: expected volatility of 50% 2015:35% based on historic volatility over the last five years: risk free interest rate of 0.5% 2015: 0.9% based on the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds with a term similar to the expected life of the award: expected departures rate of 5% pa 2015: 5% pa : and a dividend yield of nil 2015: 2.1%.
The awards granted during the year under these assumptions are summarised below: 2016 2015 Fair value at Fair value at date of grant date of grant Number of weighted Number of weighted instruments average instruments average BSP 11,369,105 5.92 5,560,276 12.05 LTIP 6,997,155 5.92 2,792,470 12.05 LTIP-ROCE 2,213,836 5.92 827,674 12.05 LTIP-TSR 2,213,836 4.12 827,674 5.30 1 The number of instruments used in the fair value models may differ from the total number of instruments awarded in the year due to awards made subsequent to the fair value calculations.
Thefair value calculated per the assumptions above has been applied to the total number of awards.
The difference in income statement charge is not considered significant.
The charges arising in respect of the other Anglo American plc employee share schemes that the Group operated during the year are not considered material.

Under the terms of these agreements, the Investment Companies have purchased Anglo American plc shares on the market and have granted to Tenon the right to nominate a third party which may include Anglo American plc but not any of its subsidiaries to take transfer of the Anglo American plc shares each has purchased on the market.
Tenon paid the Investment Companies 80% of the cost of the Anglo American plc shares including associated costs for this right to nominate, which together with subscriptions by Tenon for non-voting participating redeemable preference shares in the Investment Companies, provided all the funding required to acquire the Anglo American plc shares through the market.
These payments by Tenon were sourced from the cash resources of AASA.
Tenon is able to exercise its right of nomination at any time up to 31 December 2025 against payment of an average amount of $3.95 per share to Epoch, $6.15 per share to Epoch Two and $5.10 per share to Tarl which will be equal to 20% of the total costs respectively incurred by Epoch, Epoch Two and Tarl in purchasing shares nominated for transfer to the third party.
These funds will then become available for redemption of the preference shares issued by the Investment Companies.
The amount payable by the third party on receipt of the Anglo American plc shares will accrue to Tenon and, as these are own shares of the Company, any resulting gain or loss recorded by Tenon will not be recognised in the Consolidated income statement of Anglo American plc.
Under the agreements, the Investment Companies will receive dividends on the shares they hold and have agreed to waive the right to vote on those shares.
The preference shares issued to the charitable trusts are entitled to a participating right of up to 10% of the profit after tax of Epoch and 5% of the profit after tax of Epoch Two and Tarl.
The preference shares issued to Tenon will carry a fixed coupon of 3% plus a participating right of up to 80% of the profit after tax ofEpoch and 85% of the profit after tax of Epoch Two and Tarl.
Any remaining distributable earnings in the Investment Companies, after the above dividends, are then available for distribution as ordinary dividends to the charitable trusts.
The structure effectively provides Tenon with a beneficial interest in the price risk on these shares together with participation in future dividend receipts.
TheInvestment Companies will retain legal title to the shares until Tenon exercises its right to nominate a transferee.
At 31 December 2016 the Investment Companies together held 112,300,129 2015: 112,300,129 Anglo American plc shares, which represented 8.0% 2015:8.0% of the ordinary shares in issue excluding treasury shares with a market value of $1,603 million 2015: $498 million.
The Investment Companies are not permitted to hold more than an aggregate of 10% of the issued share capital of Anglo American plc at any one time.
The Investment Companies are considered to be structured entities.
Although the Group has no voting rights in the Investment Companies and cannot appoint or remove trustees of the charitable trusts, the Group considers that the agreement outlined above, including Tenons right to nominate the transferee of the Anglo American plc shares held by the Investment Companies, result in the Group having control over the Investment Companies as defined under IFRS 10.
Accordingly, the Investment Companies are required to be consolidated by the Group.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Board approves and monitors the risk management processes, including documented treasury policies, counterparty limits and controlling and reporting structures.
The risk management processes of the Groups independently listed subsidiaries are in line with the Groups own policy.
The types of risk exposure, the way in which such exposure is managed and quantification of the level of exposure in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31December is as follows subcategorised into credit risk, commodity price risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk.
Market risks a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will cause a loss to the Group by failing to pay for its obligation.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash, trade and other receivables, investments and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk primarily arises from these financial assets and is as follows: US$ million 2016 2015 Cash and cash equivalents 6,051 6,895 1 Trade and other receivables 2,289 1,885 2 Financial asset investments 701 662 Derivative financial assets 593 1,149 9,634 10,591 1 Trade and other receivables exclude prepayments and tax receivables.
2 Financial asset investments exclude available for sale investments.
The Group limits credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments through diversification of exposures with a range of financial institutions approved by the Board.
Counterparty limits are set for each financial institution with reference to credit ratings assigned by Standard & Poors, Moodys and Fitch Ratings, shareholder equity in case of relationship banks and fund size in case of asset managers.
Given the diverse nature of the Groups operations both in relation to commodity markets and geographically, and the use of payment security instruments including letters of credit from financial institutions, it does not have significant concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Details of the credit quality of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment are disclosed in note 16.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 159 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES 38.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued b Commodity price risk The Groups earnings are exposed to movements in the prices of the commodities it produces.
The Groups policy is to sell its products at prevailing market prices and is generally not to hedge commodity price risk, although some hedging may be undertaken for strategic reasons.
In such cases, the Group generally uses forward contracts to hedge the price risk.
Certain of the Groups sales and purchases are provisionally priced, meaning that the selling price is determined normally 30 to 180 days after delivery to the customer, based on quoted market prices stipulated in the contract, and as a result are susceptible to future price movements.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets and liabilities to commodity price risk is as follows: 2016 2015 Commodity price linked Commodity price linked Not Not Subject to linked to Subject to linked to price Fixed commodity price Fixed commodity 1 2 1 2 US$ million movements price price Total movements price price Total Total net financial instruments excluding derivatives 421 464 8,159 7,274 337 334 11,674 11,003 Derivatives 28 1,254 1,282 16 1,330 1,314 393 464 9,413 8,556 353 334 13,004 12,317 1 Includes provisionally priced trade receivables and trade payables.
2 Includes receivables and payables for commodity sales and purchases not subject to price adjustment at the balance sheet date.
Commodity based contracts that are classified as part of normal sales and purchases and settled through physical delivery of the Groups production are not marked to market.
c Foreign exchange risk As a global business, the Group is exposed to many currencies principally as a result of non-US dollar operating costs and, to a lesser extent, from non-US dollar revenue.
The Brazilian real, South African rand and Australian dollar are the most significant non-US dollar currencies influencing costs.
A strengthening of the US dollar against the currencies to which the Group is exposed has a positive effect on the Groups underlying earnings.
The Groups policy is generally not to hedge such exposures given the correlation, over the longer term, with commodity prices and the diversified nature of the Group, though exceptions can be approved by the Group Management Committee.
In addition, currency exposures exist in respect of non-US dollar approved capital expenditure projects and non-US dollar borrowings in US dollar functional currency entities.
The Groups policy is that such exposures should be hedged subject to a review of the specific circumstances of the exposure.
Analysis of foreign exchange risk associated with net debt balances and the impact of derivatives to hedge against this risk is included within note 24.
Net otherfinancial liabilities excluding net debt related balances and cash in disposal groups, but including the debit valuation adjustment attributable to derivatives hedging net debt are $72 million.
This includes net assets of $503 million denominated in US dollars and $215 million denominated in Brazilian real, and net liabilities of $212 million denominated in Australian dollars, $207 million denominated in Chilean pesos and $234 million denominated in South African rand.
d Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises due to fluctuations in interest rates which impact on the value of short term investments and financing activities.
The Group is principally exposed to US and South African interest rates.
The Groups policy is to borrow funds at floating rates of interest given the link with economic output and therefore the correlation, over the longer term, with commodity prices.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its debt.
Strategic hedging using fixed rate debt may also be undertaken from time to time if approved by the Group Management Committee.
In respect of financial assets, the Groups policy is to invest cash at floating rates of interest and to maintain cash reserves in short term investments less than one year in order to maintain liquidity, while achieving a satisfactory return for shareholders.
Analysis of interest rate risk associated with net debt balances and the impact of derivatives to hedge against this risk is included within note 24.
Net other financial liabilities excluding net debt related balances and cash in disposal groups, but including the debit valuation adjustment attributable to derivatives hedging net debt of $72 million, are primarily non-interest bearing.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued e Financial instrument sensitivities Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, derivative financial instruments, trade receivables and trade payables.
The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December to changes in foreign currencies, commodity prices and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the components of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 December.
In addition, the commodity price impact for provisionally priced contracts is based on the related trade receivables and trade payables at 31 December.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at 31 December.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: all income statement sensitivities also impact equity for debt and other deposits carried at amortised cost, carrying value does not change as interest rates move no sensitivity is provided for interest accruals as these are based on pre-agreed interest rates and therefore are not susceptible to further rate changes no sensitivity has been calculated on derivatives and related underlying instruments designated into fair value hedge relationships as these are assumed materially to offset one another all hedge relationships are assumed to be fully effective debt with a maturity of less than one year is floating rate, unless it is a long term fixed rate debt in its final year translation of foreign subsidiaries and operations into the Groups presentation currency has been excluded from the sensitivity.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the income statement and equity that would result from reasonably possible changes in the relevant foreign currency, commodity price and interest rate.
2016 2015 US$ million Income Equity Income Equity 1 Foreign currency sensitivities 10% US dollar to rand 74 74 19 19 10% US dollar to rand 74 74 19 19 2 10% US dollar to Brazilian real 1 1 46 46 2 10% US dollar to Brazilian real 1 1 46 46 10% US dollar to Australian dollar 10 10 9 9 10% US dollar to Australian dollar 10 10 9 9 10% US dollar to Chilean peso 24 24 21 21 10% US dollar to Chilean peso 24 24 24 24 Commodity price sensitivities 10% increase in the copper price 50 50 117 117 10% decrease in the copper price 50 50 117 117 10% increase in the platinum group metals price 30 30 13 13 10% decrease in the platinum group metals price 30 30 13 13 Interest rate sensitivity 3 50bps increase in LIBOR 30 30 32 32 3 50bps decrease in LIBOR 30 30 32 32 1 represents strengthening of US dollar against the respective currency.
2 Includes sensitivities for derivatives related to capital expenditure.
3 Without the impact of capitalised interest, the Groups sensitivity to a 50bps increase and decrease in LIBOR would be $57 million 2015: $61 million loss and gain respectively.
The above sensitivities are calculated with reference to a single moment in time and are subject to change due to a number of factors including: fluctuating trade receivable and trade payable balances derivative instruments and borrowings settled throughout the year fluctuating cash balances changes in currency mix.
As the sensitivities are limited to year end financial instrument balances, they do not take account of the Groups sales and operating costs, which are highly sensitive to changes in commodity prices and exchange rates.
In addition, each of the sensitivities is calculated in isolation whilst, in reality, commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currencies do not move independently.
