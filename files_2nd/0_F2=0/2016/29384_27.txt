3 Non-statutory profit measures Headline profit measures The Company seeks to present a measure of underlying performance which is not impacted by material non-recurring items or items considered non-operational in nature.
This measure of profit is described as headline and is used by management to measure and monitor performance.
See the disclosures on presentation of results in accounting policies for an explanation of the excluded items.
The excluded items are referred to as non-headline items.
Headline operating profit The non-headline items included in statutory operating profit are as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2016 31 July 2015 Notes m m Restructuring programmes 37 38 Changes to post-retirement benefits 9 14 Acquisition and disposal costs and profits on disposal 6 2 Provision for Titeflex Corporation subrogation claims 11 8 Provision for John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation 23 19 Cost recovery for John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation 16 8 7 8 Legacy retirement benefits administration costs Impairment of goodwill, property, plant and equipment and trade investments 31 27 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 10 15 33 Non-headline items in operating profit 123 117 Material items for the year ended 31 July 2016 Restructuring costs comprise 37m in respect of Fuel for Growth.
This programme, which involves redundancy, relocation and consolidation of manufacturing, is considered a material non-recurring item by virtue of its size.
The 9m charge relating to post-retirement benefits comprises the 10m settlement cost for the buy-out of retiree liabilities completed bythe US pension scheme on 14 August 2015, net of a 1m settlement gain on closing a small scheme in Holland.
An additional provision of 12m has been recognised by Titeflex Corporation in respect of changes to the estimated cost of future claims from insurance companies seeking recompense for damage allegedly caused by lightning strikes, and 1m overprovision for the costs of settling claims in the year has been released, generating a net charge of 11m.
The operating charge for John Crane, Inc. litigation comprises a charge of 8m in respect of the net increased provision for adverse judgments and legal defence costs, a charge of 7m arising from the decrease in US risk free rates, and 8m costs for litigation management, defence strategy and legal fees in connection with litigation against insurers.
This is offset in the income statement by the recovery of 16m through a settlement with one insurer.
Impairments comprise 23m goodwill write-downs see note 11, 6m on property plant and equipment and 2m on trade investments.
Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2016 149 Notes to the accounts Continued 3 Non-statutory profit measures continued Headline profit measures continued Headline operating profit continued Material items for the year ended 31 July 2015 Restructuring costs included 39m in respect of Fuel for Growth and a 1m credit for provisions relating to earlier restructuring programmes which were released in the period.
Gains of 14m on changes to post-retirement benefits arose from a settlement offer by the US defined benefit pension plans allowing deferred members a one-off option to elect to cash out their retirement entitlements rather than receive a pension at retirement which was completed in September 2014.
A charge of 8m was made by Titeflex Corporation in respect of changes to the estimated cost of future claims including those from insurance companies seeking recompense for damage allegedly caused by lightning strikes.
The change comprised 7m in respect ofmovements in the gross provision and 1m relating to changes in discounting.
The operating charge in respect of John Crane, Inc. litigation comprised 14m in respect of increased provision, 4m in respect of litigation management and legal fees in connection with litigation against insurers, and 1m arising from the decrease in US risk-free rates.

154 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2016 Strategic report Governance Accounts 8 Post-retirement benefits Smiths provides post-retirement benefits to employees in a number of countries.
This includes defined benefit and defined contribution plans and, mainly in the United Kingdom UK and United States of America US, post-retirement healthcare.
Defined contribution plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans across many countries.
In the UK a defined contribution plan has been offered since the closure of the UK defined benefit pension plans.
In the US a 401k defined contribution plan operates.
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of all these plans was 30m 2015: 28m.
Defined benefit and post-retirement healthcare plans The principal defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and in the US and these have been closed so that no future benefits are accrued.
For all schemes, pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
Thesevaluations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 July 2016.
Schemeassets are stated at their market values.
Contributions to the schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries, in accordance withlocal funding requirements.
The changes in the present value of the net pension liability in the period were: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2016 31 July 2015 m m At beginning of period 108 242 Exchange adjustment 31 3 Reclassification of small unfunded obligations 2 Current service cost 3 3 Scheme administration costs 7 8 Past service cost, curtailments, settlements 9 14 Finance income charges retirement benefits 3 8 Contributions by employer 275 84 Actuarial loss gain 39 60 Movement in surplus restriction 1 Net retirement benefit asset liability 80 108 UK pension schemes Smiths funded UK pension schemes are subject to a statutory funding objective, as set out in UK pension legislation.
Scheme trustees need to obtain regular actuarial valuations to assess the scheme against this funding objective.
The trustees and sponsoring companies need to agree funding plans to improve the position of a scheme, when it is below the acceptable funding level.
The UK Pensions Regulator has extensive powers to protect the benefits of members, promote good administration and reduce the risk of situations arising which may require compensation to be paid from the Pension Protection Fund.
These powers include imposing a schedule of contributions or the calculation of the technical provisions, where a trustee and company fail to agree appropriate calculations.
Smiths Industries Pension Scheme SIPS This scheme was closed to future accrual effective 1 November 2009.
SIPS provides index-linked pension benefits based on final earnings at date of closure.
SIPS is governed by a corporate trustee SI Trustee Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Smiths Group plc.
The board of trustee directors comprises five company-nominated trustees and four member-nominated trustees, with an independent chairman selected by Smiths Group plc.
Trustee Directors are responsible for the management, administration, funding and investment strategy of the scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation of this scheme has been performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2015, and experience gains and losses identified during this valuation have been incorporated into the IAS 19 valuation.
Under the funding plan for SIPS agreed in November 2015 Smiths pays cash contributions of 2m a month until June 2020.
As part of this agreement, Smiths contributed the index-linked gilts previously held in an escrow account.
Under the governing documentation of the SIPS, any future surplus would be returnable to Smiths Group plc by refund, assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the scheme.
SIPS will implement Guaranteed Minimum Pensions equalisation in respect of members contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pensions Scheme prior to 6 April 1997, once the government has completed its consultations and confirmed an approach.
It is not yet possible to reliably quantify the impact of this adjustment.
The duration of the SIPS liabilities is around 23 years 2015: 23 years for active deferred members, 24 years 2015: 23 years for deferred members and 12 years 2015: 12 years for pensioners and dependants.
Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2016 155 Notes to the accounts Continued 8 Post-retirement benefits continued Defined benefit and post-retirement healthcare plans continued UK pension schemes continued TI Group Pension Scheme TIGPS This scheme was closed to future accrual effective 1 November 2009.
TIGPS provides index-linked pension benefits based on final earnings at the date of closure.
TIGPS is governed by a corporate trustee TI Pension Trustee Limited, an independent company.
The board of trustee directors comprises five company-nominated trustees and four member-nominated trustees, with an independent trustee director selected by the Trustee.
The Trustee is responsible for the management, administration, funding and investment strategy of the scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation of this scheme has been performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 5 April 2015.
Underthe funding plan for TIGPS agreed in March 2016 Smiths pays cash contributions of 3m a year until April 2018.
Under the governing documentation of the TIGPS, any future surplus would be returnable to Smiths Group plc by refund, assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the scheme.
TIGPS will implement Guaranteed Minimum Pensions equalisation in respect of members contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pensions Scheme prior to 6 April 1997, once the government has completed its consultations and confirmed an approach.
The duration of the TIGPS liabilities is around 25 years 2015: 21 years for active deferred members, 24 years 2015: 19 years for deferred members and 11 years 2015: 11 years for pensioners and dependants.
US pension plans The most recent valuations of the six principal US pension and post-retirement healthcare plans were performed at 1 January 2015.
The pension plans were closed with effect from 30 April 2009 and benefits were calculated as at that date and are not revalued.
Governance of the US pension plans is managed by a Settlor Committee appointed by Smiths Group Services Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary.
The duration of the liabilities for the largest US plan is around 20 years 2015: 14 years for active deferred members, 20 years 2015: 19 years for deferred members and 12 years 2015: 10 years for pensioners and dependants.
On 14 August 2015 the US funded plans completed a buy-out of retiree liabilities for $527m, transferring the obligation to pay pensions to Voya Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company.
A settlement loss of 10m has been recognised on this transaction see note 3.
InAugust2014, the US pension plans offered deferred members a one-off option to elect to cash out their retirement entitlements rather than receive a pension at retirement.
Lump sum payments of $150m were made in August and September 2014.
This programme generated a settlement gain of 14m in the year ended 31 July 2015.
Risk management The pensions schemes are exposed to risks that: investment returns are below expectations, leaving the scheme with insufficient assets in future to pay all its pension obligations: members and dependants live longer than expected, increasing the value of the pensions the scheme has to pay: inflation rates are higher than expected, so amounts payable under index-linked pensions are higher than expected: and increased contributions may be required to meet regulatory funding targets if lower interest rates increase the current value of liabilities.
These risks are managed separately for each pension scheme.
However Smiths has adopted a common approach of closing defined benefit schemes to cap members entitlements and supporting trustees in adopting investment strategies which match assets to future obligations, after allowing for the funding position of the scheme.
TI Group Pension Scheme TIGPS TIGPS with a mature member profile, and a strong funding position, has been able to progress its matching strategy to the point where roughly 50% of liabilities are covered by matching annuities, eliminating investment return, longevity, inflation and funding risks.
Smiths Industries Pension Scheme SIPS In August 2014 SIPS adjusted the scheme investment strategy.
The scheme has investments in diversified growth funds and a portfolio of exchange traded equity index futures managed by BlackRock.
The risk and return characteristics of equity index futures are similar to physical equities, but provide the scheme with improved liquidity.
As at 31 July 2016 the SIPS portfolio of exchange traded equity index futures generated a 163m 2015: 497m exposure to equities.
Following the company contribution of 152m UK government bonds to SIPS in December 2015 and the resulting improvement in the funding position, the trustees have adopted a leveraged liability matching strategy.
The scheme uses repurchase arrangements, total return swaps, inflation swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge the interest and inflation risks of the scheme liabilities.
Repurchase agreements exchange government bonds held by the scheme for cash with an obligation to buy back the asset at a fixed future date and price.
The cash is invested in liability matching assets, reducing funding risk.
A total return swap exchanges the return on a specified asset for example an index-linked bond and an interest payment fixed or floating.
Contracts are spread across a panel of banks.
To minimise the risk that counterparties fail to settle obligations, positions are collateralised.
For repurchase agreements, collateral is the difference between the present value of the repurchase obligation and the value of the asset exchanged.
For swaps, collateral is based on market values.
At 31 July 2016 scheme assets were net of 720m 2015: nil repurchase obligations, and nominal exposure from interest rate swaps of 293m, inflation swaps of 263m and total return swaps of 14m.

The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
For countries outside the UK and USA assumptions are disclosed as a weighted average.
Discount rate assumptions The UK schemes use a discount rate based on the yield on the iBOXX over 15-year AA-rated corporate bond index, adjusted if necessary tobetter reflect the shape of the yield curve considering the Aon Hewitt GBP Select AA curve.
For the USA, the discount rate is based on the Towers Watson cash-flow matching models and set with reference to Moodys Aa annualised yield, the Citigroup High Grade Index and the Merrill Lynch 15 years High Quality Index.
Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions used in the principal UK schemes are based on the new SAPS S2 All Birth year tables with relevant scaling factors based on the recent experience of the schemes.
The assumption allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the 2015 CMI projections, blended to a long-term rate of 1.25%.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal US schemes are based on the RP-2014 table adjusted backward to 2006 with MP-2014 and projected forward using MP-2015 as of 31 July 2016.
The table selected allows for future mortality improvements and applies an adjustment for job classification blue collar versus white collar.

Asset valuation Liquidity funds, equities and bonds are valued using quoted market prices in active markets.
Exchange traded equity index futures are valued at market prices.
Total return, interest and inflation swaps are bilateral agreements between counterparties and do not have observable market prices.
Thesederivative contracts are valued using observable market inputs.
Insured liabilities comprise annuity policies matching the scheme obligation to identified groups of pensioners.
These assets are valued at the actuarial valuation of the corresponding liability, reflecting this matching relationship.
Property is valued by specialists applying recognised property valuation methods incorporating current market data on rental yields and transaction prices.

160 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2016 Strategic report Governance Accounts 9 Employee share schemes The Group operates share schemes and plans for the benefit of employees.
The nature of the principal schemes and plans, including general conditions, is set out below: Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is a share plan under which an award over a capped number of shares will vest after the end of the three-year performance period if performance conditions are met.
LTIP awards are made to selected senior executives, including the executive directors.
Awards made prior to 2016 were made with different targets for corporate executives and divisional executives.
From 2016 onwards, all LTIP awards will have oneset of targets.
LTIP performance conditions Each performance condition has a threshold below which no shares vest and a maximum performance target at or above which the award vests in full.
For performance between threshold and maximum, awards vest on a straight-line sliding scale.
The performance conditions are assessed separately, so performance on one condition does not affect the vesting of the other elements of the award.
To the extent that the performance targets are not met over the three-year performance period, awards will lapse.
There is no re-testing of the .
Group LTIP awards have performance conditions relating to underlying revenue growth, growth in headline EPS adjusted to exclude tax, ROCE, cash conversion and, for awards made before 2015, TSR relative to the FTSE 100 excluding financial services companies.
Divisional LTIP awards have performance conditions relating to divisional performance against headline KPIs, including underlying revenue and operating profit growth, operating margins, ROCE, operating cash conversion, employee engagement and quality metrics.
Smiths Group Co-Investment Plan CIP and Smiths Share Matching Plan SMP In 2015 the CIP was replaced by the SMP.
Under the CIP and SMP participants are required to invest between 25% and 50% of their post-tax bonus purchasing the Companys shares at the prevailing market price.
At the end of a three-year period, if the executive is still in office and provided the performance test is passed, matching shares will be awarded in respect of any invested shares retained for that period.
The number of matching shares to be awarded is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the end of the year in which the bonus is earned by reference to annual bonus, and other corporate financial criteria.
The maximum award will not exceed the value, before tax, of the bonus or salary invested in shares by the executive.
For the CIP, vesting of matching shares will occur, and the matching shares will be released, at the end of the three-year period if the Groups Return on Capital Employed ROCE over the performance period exceeds the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC over the performance period by an average margin of at least 1% per annum.
If ROCE exceeds WACC by an average margin of 3% per annum, the enhanced performance condition is met, and a second matching share will be issued for every purchased share.
For the SMP, vesting of matching shares will occur, and the matching shares will be released, at the end of the three-year period depending on the performance of the Group LTIP issued for the same performance period.
The first matching share is awarded if the Group LTIP vests under any performancecondition.
No future awards will be made under the CIP or SMP.
Restricted stock The restricted stock is used by the Remuneration Committee, as a part of the recruitment strategy, to make awards in recognition of incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
If an award is considered appropriate, the award will take account of relevant factors including the fair value of awards forfeited, any performance conditions attached, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
See the Directors Remuneration Report pages 94 to 114 for details of the awards made toexecutive directors recruited in the year.
The average closing share price over the financial year was 1,049.61p 2015:1,176.19p.

The key assumptions used in the models for 2016 and 2015 are volatility of 25% to 30% 2015: 20% to 25% and dividend yield of 3.75% 2015: 3.75%, based on historical data, for the period corresponding with the vesting period of the option.
These generated a weighted average fair value for SMP CIP of 10.34 2015: 12.47, Group LTIP of 10.33 2015: 10.78 and divisional LTIP of 10.33 2015: 12.55, and restricted stock of 10.03 2015: no grants.
The fair value disclosed for the SMP CIP award treats the two matching shares as separate options.
Included within staff costs is an expense arising from share-based payment transactions of 10m 2015: 9m, of which 9m 2015: 8m relates to equity-settled share-based payment.

Value in use or fair value less cost to sell calculations are used todetermine the recoverable amount of goodwill held allocated to each group of cash generating units CGU.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted cash-flows of the CGU.
These forecast cash-flows are based on the 2017 budget, thefive-year strategic plan approved by the Board and detailed divisional strategic projections, where these have been prepared and approved by the Board.
Fair value less cost to sell is calculated using available information on past and expected future profitability, valuation multiples for comparable quoted companies adjusted as required for significant differences and information on costs of similar transactions.
Fairvalue less costs to sell models are used when trading projections in the strategic plan cannot be adjusted to eliminate the impact  Goodwill is allocated by division as follows: 2016 2015 2016 Number of 2015 Number of m CGUs m CGUs John Crane 108 3 92 3 Smiths Medical 591 1 508 1 Smiths Detection 410 1 343 1 Smiths Interconnect 381 5 340 5 Flex-Tek 27 2 23 2 1,517 12 1,306 12 The goodwill allocated to Smiths Interconnect Power has been split, and part of it allocated to Smiths Interconnect Microwave Telecoms, following the transfer of the protection business from Smiths Interconnect Power to Smiths Interconnect Microwave Telecoms to increase synergies from the customer base of these businesses.
Goodwill was also reallocated from Smiths Interconnect Microwave Subsystems to Smiths Interconnect Microwave Components when a business was transferred between the two business units.
These changes were made to reflect how the businesses were being managed.
If goodwill had not been reallocated, the impairment recognised for Smiths Interconnect Microwave Telecoms and Smiths Interconnect Microwave Components would have been smaller.
Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2016 163 Notes to the accounts Continued 11 Impairment testing continued Goodwill continued Goodwill impairment John Crane Production Solutions JCPS JCPS is a business unit of John Crane focused on the servicing and provision of onshore down-hole artificial lift pumping hardware and systems.
Goodwill of nil 2015: 5m is allocated to JCPS.
An impairment test was carried out following completion of the annual strategic planning process because the significant decline in oil prices had adversely affected JCPS customers.
JCPS anticipate that customers will continue to scale back expansion plans and reduce running costs.
Following this impairment test, the JCPS goodwill has been impaired by 5m 2015: 27m and property, plant and equipment where the value is expected to be recovered at a CGU level has been impaired by 5m 2015: no impairment.
The impairment has occurred because JCPS is now expected to have lower levels of trading activity, operatingmargins and growth in the future, significantly reducing the value in use of the business.
The impairment loss has been recognised in John Crane administration expenses, and excluded from headline operating profit for the division.

The gross margins included in the projections are lower than historical due to lower levels of activity.
As required by IAS 36: Impairment ofassets, margin projections for JCPS are based on the current fixed cost base, and do not incorporate any future restructuring.
At 31 July 2016 the Artificial lift business, comprising the US and Romanian activities of JCPS, was classified as held for sale see note 27.
Smiths Interconnect Microwave Components Goodwill of 66m 2015: 52m is allocated to Smiths Interconnect Microwave Components.
The underlying increase in goodwill is due to areorganisation that moved a business from Smiths Interconnect Microwave Subsystems to Smiths Interconnect Microwave Components.
Animpairment test was carried out following the completion of the annual strategic planning process, which identified increased execution risks affecting the long-term strategy.

The underlying increase in goodwill is due toa reorganisation that moved the protection business from Smiths Interconnect Power to Smiths Interconnect Microwave Telecoms.
Animpairment test was carried out following the completion of the annual strategic planning process, which identified execution risks affecting this CGU.
The impairment testing used a fair value less costs to sell model to value the businesses, because the Board approved forecasts for this business fundamentally incorporated significant reorganisation activity.

Sales assumptions for Smiths Interconnect Microwave Telecoms are based on the current order book, sales projections from major customers, technology developments, and competitor strategies.
Fair value was calculated using a level 3 valuation model.
Valuation multiples were based on adjusted valuation multiples for listed comparator companies, validated against publically available information on transaction multiples.
Costs to sell were estimated based onGroup experience of transactions involving businesses of a similar size.
Impairment testing assumptions John Crane and Smiths Medical have strong aftermarket and consumables businesses, with consistent sales trends.
Smiths Detection and Smiths Interconnect have greater sales and margin volatility due to lower levels of recurring revenue and involvement in government-funded programmes, particularly defence, and customer-led technology innovation.
The key assumptions used in value in use calculations are: Sales: projected sales are built up with reference to markets and product categories.
They incorporate past performance, historical growth rates and projections of developments in key markets.
Margins: projected margins reflect historical performance and the impact of all completed projects to improve operational efficiency andleverage scale.
The projections do not include the impact of future restructuring projects to which the Group is not yet committed.
Discount rate: the discount rates have been calculated based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital and risks specific to the CGU being tested.
The discount rates disclosed incorporate risk adjustments where the projected sales and margins are affected by significant delivery risks.
Pre-tax rates of 11.0% to 14.3% 2015: 10.7% to 16.2% have been used for the impairment testing.
Long-term growth rates: as required by IAS 36, growth rates for the period after the detailed forecasts are based on the long-term GDP projections of the primary market for the CGU.
The average growth rate used in the testing was 2.19% 2015: 2.16%.
These rates do not reflect the long-term assumptions used by the Group for investment planning.
The assumptions used in the impairment testing of significant CGUs are as follows: Year ended 31 July 2016 Smiths Smiths John Crane Medical Detection Smiths Interconnect Core Rotating Microwave Equipment Subsystems Connectors Power Net book value of goodwill m 104 591 410 75 100 128 Discount rate 13.4% 11.0% 13.9% 11.8% 13.5% 11.7% Period covered by management projections 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years Long-term growth rates 2.3% 2.1% 2.0% 2.3% 2.0% 2.3% Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2016 165 Notes to the accounts Continued 11 Impairment testing continued Goodwill continued Impairment testing assumptions continued Year ended 31 July 2015 Smiths Smiths John Crane Medical Detection Smiths Interconnect Core Rotating Microwave Equipment Subsystems Connectors Power Net book value of goodwill m 82 508 343 72 85 123 Discount rate 11.9% 10.7% 14.4% 12.6% 15.4% 12.2% Period covered by management projections 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years Long-term growth rates 2.0% 2.2% 2.2% 2.5% 1.5% 2.5% The remaining balance of the goodwill represents smaller individual amounts which have been allocated to smaller CGUs.
Sensitivity analysis Smiths Interconnect Power Smiths Interconnect Powers value in use exceeds its carrying value by 1m 2015: 14m.
Sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that for Smiths Interconnect Power, the following changes in assumptions in isolation, would cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value.
The 2015 sensitivities relate to the combined business of Smiths Interconnect Power and Smiths Interconnect Microwave Telecoms Protection, since they were only split in the current year.
Year ended 31 July 2016 Year ended 31 July 2015 Change required to trigger impairment Change required to trigger impairment Forecast revenue 1% reduction 10% reduction Forecast margins 10 basis points lower 120 basis points lower Discount rate 10 basis points higher 100 basis points higher Long-term growth rates 10 basis points lower 190 basis points lower Sales assumptions for Smiths Interconnect Power are based on: the current order book: proportion of recent tenders which have been successful: and independent projections of the expected growth of the data centre market in North America.
Margin projections for Smiths Interconnect Power are based on current variable costs and production capacity, and the expected costs of increasing capacity to support higher levels of sales.
The directors also reviewed the fair value less costs to sell for the division when considering the results of the impairment testing, which also supported the conclusion that the Smiths Interconnect Power goodwill was not impaired.
Other CGUs For the other CGUs, sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that no reasonable changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any of the CGUs to exceed their respective recoverable amounts.
Other intangible assets The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill.
During the year impairment tests were carried out for development projects which have not yet started to be amortised and acquired intangibles where there were indications of impairment.
Value in use calculations were used to determine the recoverable values of these assets.
No impairment charges have been incurred 2015: nil.
Property, plant and equipment Impairment charges of 5m for property, plant and equipment of John Crane Production Solutions have been recognised in the year, principally relating to property.
Please see disclosures above under goodwill for an explanation of the circumstances affecting this business.
There are 1m impairment charges for sites affected by the Fuel for Growth restructuring see note 3.

Netting Cash and overdraft balances in interest compensation cash pooling systems are reported gross on the balance sheet.
The cash pooling agreements incorporate a legally enforceable right of net settlement.
However, there is no intention to settle the balances net, so these arrangements do not qualify for net presentation.
At 31 July 2016 and 31 July 2015 the total value of overdrafts on accounts in interest compensation cash pooling systems was less than 1m.
The balances held in zero balancing cash pooling arrangements have daily settlement of balances, so netting is not relevant.

18 Financial risk management The Groups international operations and debt financing expose it to financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in debt market prices, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.
Treasury and risk management policies are set by the Board.
The policy sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments to manage risk.
The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency derivatives, debt and other interest rate derivatives.
The central treasury function monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies.
The management of operational credit risk is discussed in note 14. a Foreign exchange risk Transactional currency exposure The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
It is Group policy that, when the net foreign exchange exposure to known future sales and purchases is material, this exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The net exposure is calculated by adjusting the expected cash-flow for payments or receipts in the same currency linked to the sale or purchase.
This policy minimises the risk that the profits generated from the transaction will be affected by foreign exchange movements which occur after the price has been determined.
Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are only undertaken if it is cost effective.
The following table shows the currency of financial instruments.

Based on the assets and liabilities held at the year-end, if the specified currencies were to strengthen 10% while all other market ratesremained constant, the change in the fair value of financial instruments not designated as net investment hedges would have thefollowingeffect: Impact Gain loss Impact Gain loss on profit recognised in on profit recognised in for the year reserves for the year reserves 31 July 2016 31 July 2016 31 July 2015 31 July 2015 m m m m US dollar 3 2 4 2 Euro 6 3 4 Sterling 16 2 1 These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax and exclude the effect of quasi-equity intra-group loans.
Cash-flow hedging The Group uses foreign currency contracts to hedge future foreign currency sales and purchases.
At 31 July 2016 contracts with a nominal value of 393m 2015: 317m were designated as hedging instruments.
In addition, the Group had outstanding foreign currency contracts with a nominal value of 529m 2015: 314m which were being used to manage transactional foreign exchange exposures, but were not accounted for as cash-flow hedges.
The fair value of the contracts is disclosed in note 19.
The majority of hedged transactions will be recognised in the consolidated income statement in the same period that the cash flows are expected to occur, with the only differences arising because of normal commercial credit terms on sales and purchases.
Of the foreign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments 91% are for periods of 12 months or less 2015: 92%.
The movements in the cash-flow hedge reserve during the period are summarised in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2016 31 July 2015 m m Brought forward cash-flow hedge reserve at start of year 3 Gains losses on effective cash-flow hedges recognised in equity 10 2 Amounts removed from the hedge reserve and recognised in the following lines on the income statement revenue 1 cost of sales 1 1 Carried forward cash-flow hedge reserve at end of year 7 3 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2016 171 Notes to the accounts Continued 18 Financial risk management continued a Foreign exchange risk continued Translational currency exposure The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the United States and Europe.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be significantly affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies, except where significant adverse interest differentials or other factors would render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing primarily in the relevant currency or in some cases indirectly using forward foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps.
Net investment hedges The table below sets out the currency of loans and swap contracts designated as net investment hedges: At 31 July 2016 Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Loans designated as net investment hedges 625 767 1,392 Cross-currency swap contracts 358 373 15 Currency swap contracts 111 111 111 983 394 111 1,377 At 31 July 2015 Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Loans designated as net investment hedges 524 624 1,148 Cross-currency swap contracts 306 302 4 Currency swap contracts 90 90 90 830 322 90 1,152 At 31 July 2016 swap contracts hedged the Groups exposure to Canadian dollars, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi 31 July 2015: Canadian dollars, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi.
All the currency swap contracts designated as net investment hedges are current 2015: current.
The cross-currency swap contracts willmature in April 2023.
The gains and losses that have been deferred in the net investment hedge reserve are shown in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2016 31 July 2015 m m Brought forward net investment hedge reserve at start of year 66 58 Amounts deferred in the period on effective net investment hedges 228 8 Carried forward net investment hedge reserve at end of year 294 66 The fair values of these net investment hedges are subject to exchange rate movements.
Based on the hedging instruments in place at the year-end, if the specified currencies were to strengthen 10% while all other market rates remained constant, it would have the following effect: Loss Loss recognised recognised in hedge in hedge reserve reserve 31 July 2016 31 July 2015 m m US dollar 98 80 Euro 35 35 These movements would be fully offset by an opposite movement on the retranslation of the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries.
These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax.
172 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2016 Strategic report Governance Accounts 18 Financial risk management continued b Interest rate risk The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
The Groups current policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for greater than 70% of the level of gross debt.
This is achieved through fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps.
At 31 July 2016 59% 2015: 57% of the Groups gross borrowings were at fixed interest rates, after adjusting for interest rate swaps and the impact of short maturity derivatives designated as net investment hedges.
The Group monitors its fixed rate risk profile against both gross and net debt.
For medium-term planning, it now focuses on gross debt to eliminate the fluctuations of variable cash levelsover the cycle.
The weighted average interest rate on borrowings and cross-currency swaps at 31 July 2016, after interest rate swaps, is 3.68% 2015:3.98%.
Interest rate profile of financial assets and liabilities and the fair value of borrowings The following table shows the interest rate risk exposure of investments, cash and borrowings, with the borrowings adjusted for the impact of interest rate hedging.
The other financial assets and liabilities do not earn or bear interest and for all financial instruments except for borrowings the carrying value is not materially different from their fair value.

These positions hedge the risk of variability in the fair value of borrowings arising from fluctuations in base rates.
The fair values of the hedging instruments are disclosed in note 19.
The effect of the swaps is to convert 552m 2015: 462m debt from fixed rate to floating rate.
Sensitivity of interest charges to interest rate movements The Group has exposure to sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.
However the Group does not have a significant exposure to interest rate movements for any individual currency.
Based on the composition of net debt and foreign exchange rates at 31 July 2016, and taking into consideration all fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps in place, a one percentage point 100 basis points change in average floating interest rates for all three currencies would have a 2.1m 2015: 0.2m impact on the Groups profit before tax.
Following the contribution of the UK Gilts to the pension scheme, the sensitivity of investments to changes in interest rates is no longer material.
Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2016 173 Notes to the accounts Continued 18 Financial risk management continued c Financial credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Board-approved policy of only placing cashdeposits with highly rated relationship bank counterparties within counterparty limits established by reference to their Standard & Poors long-term debt rating.
In the normal course of business, the Group operates cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies.
The maximum credit risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets, excluding trade andother receivables and derivatives, totals 440m at 31 July 2016 2015: 651m.

d Liquidity risk Borrowing facilities The Board policy specifies the maintenance of unused committed credit facilities of at least 200m at all times to ensure it has sufficient available funds for operations and planned development, which is provided by a multi-currency revolving credit facility.
On 19 February 2014 Smiths completed the refinancing of its existing $800m Revolving Credit Facility.
The two uncommitted extension options have been exercised on 4 February 2015 and 3 February 2016.
The facility now matures on 19 February 2021.
At the balance sheet date, the Group had the following undrawn credit facilities: 31 July 2016 31 July 2015 m m Expiring within one year Expiring between one and two years Expiring after more than two years 605 512 605 512 Cash deposits As at 31 July 2016, 270m 2015: 391m of cash and cash equivalents was on deposit with various banks of which 119m 2015: 301m was on deposit in the UK.

Trading Warranty provision and product liability At 31 July 2016 there are warranty and product liability provisions of 29m 2015: 24m.
Warranties over the Groups products typically coverperiods of between one and three years.
Provision is made for the likely cost of after-sales support based on the recent past experience ofindividual businesses.
Commercial disputes and litigation in respect of ongoing business activities The Group has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property and other rights against infringement.
It has also had to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties, including product liability and insurance subrogation claims.
Provision is made for any expected costs and liabilities in relation to these proceedings where appropriate, though there can be no guarantee that such provisions which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time will accurately predict the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
Trading provisions include 1m 2015: 1m in connection with ongoing price audits of overhead cost recovery charges associated with certain historical supply arrangements and royalty claims linked to customer funded development projects.
Contingent liabilities In the ordinary course of its business, the Group is subject to commercial disputes and litigation such as government price audits, product liability claims, employee disputes and other kinds of lawsuits, and faces different types of legal issues in different jurisdictions.
The high level of activity in the US, for example, exposes the Group to the likelihood of various types of litigation commonplace in that country, such as mass tort and class action litigation, legal challenges to the scope and validity of patents, and product liability and insurance subrogation claims.
These types of proceedings or the threat of them are also used to create pressure to encourage negotiated settlement of disputes.
Any claim brought against the Group with or without merit, could be costly to defend.
These matters are inherently difficult to quantify.
In appropriate cases a provision is recognised based on best estimates and management judgement but there can be no guarantee that these provisions which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
There are also contingent liabilities in respect of litigation for which no provisions are made.
The Group operates in some markets where the risk of unethical or corrupt behaviour is material and has procedures, including an employee Ethics Alertline, to help it identify potential issues.
Such procedures will, from time to time, give rise to internal investigations, sometimes conducted with external support, to ensure that Smiths Group properly understands risks and concerns and can take steps both to manage immediate issues and to improve its practices and procedures for the future.
The Group also co-operates with relevant authorities in investigating business conduct issues whenever requested to.
The Group is not aware of any issues which are expected to generate material financial exposures.
Non-headline and legacy John Crane, Inc. John Crane, Inc. JCI is one of many co-defendants in numerous lawsuits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from alleged exposure to, or use of, products previously manufactured which contained asbestos.
Until 2006, the awards, the related interest and all material defence costs were met directly by insurers.
In 2007, JCI secured the commutation of certain insurance policies in respect of product liability.
Provision is made in respect of the expected costs of defending known and predicted future claims andof adverse judgments in relation thereto, to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated.
The JCI products generally referred to in these cases consist of industrial sealing product, primarily packing and gaskets.
The asbestos was encapsulated within these products in such a manner that causes JCI to believe, based on tests conducted on its behalf, that the products were safe.
JCI ceased manufacturing products containing asbestos in 1985.
178 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2016 Strategic report Governance Accounts 22 Provisions and contingent liabilities continued Non-headline and legacy continued John Crane, Inc. continued John Crane, Inc. litigation provision While JCI has excess liability insurance, the availability of such insurance and scope of the cover are currently the subject of litigation in the United States.
Pending the outcome of that litigation, JCI has met defence costs directly.
JCI has recognised the recovery of 16m through a settlement with an insurer see note 3 but this agreement does not provide any cover for future costs.
The calculation of the provision does not take account of any potential recoveries from insurers.
JCI continues to actively monitor the conduct and effect of its current and expected asbestos litigation, including the most efficacious presentation of its safe product defence, and intends to continue to resist these asbestos claims based upon this defence.
Approximately 247,000 claims 2015: 242,000 claims against JCI have been dismissed before trial over the last 37 years.
JCI is currently a defendant in cases involving approximately 74,000 claims 2015: 76,000 claims.
Despite the large number of claims brought against JCI, since the inception of the litigation it has had final judgments against it, after appeals, in 137 cases 2015: 133 cases over the period, and has had to pay awards amounting to approximately US$158m 2015: US$153m.
JCI has also incurred significant additional defence costs.
The litigation involves claims for a number of allegedly asbestos related diseases, with awards, when made, for mesothelioma tending to be larger than those for the other diseases JCIs ability to defend mesothelioma cases successfully is, therefore, likely to have a significant impact on its annual aggregate adverse judgment and defence costs.
The provision is based on past history and published tables of asbestos incidence projections and is determined using asbestos valuation experts, Bates White LLC.
Whilst published incidence curves can be used to estimate the likely future pattern of asbestos related disease, John Crane, Inc. s claims experience is significantly impacted by other factors which influence the US litigation environment.
These can include: changing approaches on the part of the plaintiffs bar: changing attitudes amongst the judiciary at both trial and appellate levels: and legislative and procedural changes in both the state and federal court systems.
The projections use a 10 year time horizon on the basis that Bates White LLC consider that there is substantial uncertainty in the asbestos litigation environment so probable expenditures are not reasonably estimable beyond this time horizon.
The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of provision include: the period over which the expenditure can be reliably estimated: the future trend of legal costs: the rate of future claims filed: the rate of successful resolution of claims: and the average amount of judgments awarded.
The provision in respect of JCI is a discounted pre-tax provision using discount rates, being the risk-free rate on US debt instruments for the appropriate period.
The deferred tax asset related to this provision is shown within the deferred tax balance note 6.
Set out below is the gross, discounted and post-tax information relating to this provision: 31 July 2016 31 July 2015 m m Gross provision 267 236 Discount 15 20 Discounted pre-tax provision 252 216 Deferred tax 84 72 Discounted post-tax provision 168 144 John Crane, Inc. litigation provision sensitivities However, because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of asbestos claims and of the costs arising out of related litigation, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and, as a result, the provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time if new information becomes available as a result of future events.
Statistical analysis of the provision indicates that there is a 50% probability that the total future spend will fall between 250m and 280m 2015: between 221m and 248m, compared to the gross provision value of 267m 2015: 236m.
The projections use a 10 year time horizon.
Reducing the time horizon by one year would reduce the provision by 18m 2015: 15m andreducing it by five years would reduce the provision by 107m 2015: 91m.
John Crane, Inc. contingent liabilities Provision has been made for future defence costs and the cost of adverse judgments expected to occur.
JCIs claims experience is significantly impacted by other factors which influence the US litigation environment.
As a result, whilst the Group anticipates that asbestos litigation will continue beyond the period covered by the provision, the uncertainty surrounding the US litigation environment beyond this point is such that the costs cannot be reliably estimated.
Although the methodology used to calculate the JCI litigation provision can in theory be applied to show claims and costs for longer periods, the Directors consider, based on advice from Bates White, that the level of uncertainty regarding the factors used in estimating future costs is too great to provide for reasonable estimation of the numbers of future claims, the nature of such claims or the cost to resolve them for yearsbeyond the 10 year time horizon.
Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2016 179 Notes to the accounts Continued 22 Provisions and contingent liabilities continued Non-headline and legacy continued Titeflex Corporation In recent years Titeflex Corporation, a subsidiary of the Group in the Flex-Tek division, has received a number of claims from insurance companies seeking recompense on a subrogated basis for the effects of damage allegedly caused by lightning strikes in relation to its flexible gas piping product.
It has also received a number of product liability claims regarding this product, some in the form of purported class actions.
Titeflex Corporation believes that its products are a safe and effective means of delivering gas when installed in accordance with the manufacturers instructions and local and national codes: however some claims have been settled on an individual basis without admission of liability.
Equivalent third-party products in the US marketplace face similar challenges.
Titeflex Corporation litigation provision The continuing progress of claims and the pattern of settlement, together with the recent market place activity, provide sufficient evidence to recognise a liability in the accounts.
Therefore provision has been made for the costs which the Group is expected to incur in respect of future claims to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated.
Titeflex Corporation sells flexible gas piping with extensive installation and safety guidance revised in 2008 designed to assure the safety of the product and minimise the risk of damage associated with lightning strikes.
The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of provision, which are based on past experience, include: the period over which expenditure can be reliably estimated: the number of future settlements: the average amount of settlements: and the impact of statutes of repose and safe installation initiatives on the expected number of future claims.
This is the first year that the company has had sufficient evidence of the impact of statutes of repose and safe installation initiatives to incorporate them into the provision calculation.
Reflecting work completed in the year on streamlining the settlement process, and dismissing claims covered by statutes of repose, the Directors consider that the pattern of resolution of future potential claims by Titeflex Corporation is now more predictable.
As a result, the provision model has been extended.
Incorporating the two additional assumptions and extending the time period generated a net 16m increase in the provision.
The provision of 94m 2015: 71m is a discounted pre-tax provision using discount rates, being the risk-free rate on US debt instruments forthe appropriate period.
31 July 2016 31 July 2015 m m Gross provision 140 77 Discount 46 6 Discounted pre-tax provision 94 71 Deferred tax 36 27 Discounted post-tax provision 58 44 Titeflex Corporation litigation provision sensitivities However, because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of claims and of the costs arising out of related litigation, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and, as a result, the provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time if new information becomes available as a result of future events.
The projections incorporate a long-term assumption about the impact of safe installation initiatives on the level of future claims.
If the assumed annual benefit of bonding and grounding initiatives was 0.5% higher the provision would be 6m lower, and if the benefit was 0.5% lower, the provision would increase by 7m.
Other non-headline and legacy Legacy provisions comprise provisions relating to former business activities and properties no longer used by Smiths.
Non-headline provisions comprise all provisions that were disclosed as non-headline items when they were charged to the consolidated income statement.
These provisions cover non-headline reorganisation, vacant properties, disposal indemnities and litigation in respect of old products and discontinued business activities.
Reorganisation and property At 31 July 2016 there were provisions of 11m 2015: 6m related to Fuel for Growth, 3m 2015: 6m related to onerous leases and dilapidations provisions, and 2m 2015: 1m related to actual and potential environmental issues for sites which were no longer occupied bySmiths operations.
The Fuel for Growth provisions are expected to be utilised in 2017.
Disposal Other provisions include disposal provisions of 3m 2015: 3m relating to warranties and other obligations in respect of the disposal oftheMarine Systems and Aerospace businesses.
Most of the balance is expected to be utilised within the next three years.

At 31 July 2016 the Trust held 852 2015: 852 ordinary shares.
The capital redemption reserve, revaluation reserve and merger reserve arose from: share repurchases: revaluations of property, plant and equipment: and merger accounting for business combinations before the adoption of IFRS, respectively.
Capital management Capital employed comprises total equity adjusted for goodwill recognised directly in reserves, net post-retirement benefit related assets and liabilities, net litigation provisions relating to non-headline items and net debt.
The efficiency of the allocation of the capital to the divisions is monitored through the return on capital employed ROCE.
This ratio is calculated over a rolling 12-month period and is the percentage that headline operating profit comprises of monthly average capital employed.
The capital structure is based on the directors judgement of the balance required to maintain flexibility while achieving an efficient cost of capital.
The ratio of net debt to headline EBITDA of 1.6 2015: 1.4 is within the Groups stated policy of less than 2.0 over the medium term.
The Groups robust balance sheet and record of strong cash generation is more than able to fund the immediate investment needs and other legacy obligations.
As part of its capital management the Group strategy is to maintain a solid investment grade credit rating to ensure access to the widest possible sources of financing and to minimise the resulting cost of capital.
At 31 July 2016 the Group had a credit rating of BBB Baa2 2015:BBB Baa2 with Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
The Board has a progressive dividend policy for future payouts, with the aim of increasing dividends in line with the long-term underlying growth in earnings.
In setting the level of dividend payments, the Board will take into account prevailing economic conditions and future investment plans, along with the objective to maintain minimum dividend cover of around 2.0.
