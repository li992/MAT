FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1.
AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH IFRSs The Group and Company financial statements of Cranswick plc the Company for the year ended 31 March 2016 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 24 May 2016 and the balance sheets were signed on the Boards behalf by Martin Davey and Mark Bottomley.
Cranswick plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group and by the Company are set out in Note 2.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF PREPARATION The financial statements of Cranswick plc, both consolidated and Company, have been prepared under IFRS as adopted by the European Union and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
A summary of the principal accounting policies, which have been consistently applied throughout the year and the preceding year, is as follows: BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Cranswick plc and its subsidiaries.
The results of undertakings acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 31 March 2016.
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has: power over the investee i. e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee : exposure, or right, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary.
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the statement of comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Groups accounting policies.
All intra-Group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.
However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, apart from those involving estimations, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements: Share-based payments Note 24 measurement of share-based payments Goodwill Note 11 measurement of the recoverable amount of cash-generating units containing goodwill Provisions Note 21 judgements in relation to amounts provided Pensions Note 25 pension scheme actuarial assumptions Acquisitions Note 14 fair values on acquisition Biological assets Note 15 assumptions in relation to mortality Trade receivable provisions Note 17 provision for impairment of trade receivables NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS APPLIED The following accounting standards and interpretations became effective for the current reporting period: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRSs Effective date Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle 1 July 2014 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle 1 July 2014 The application of these standards has not had a material effect on the net assets, results and disclosures of the Group.
90 Cranswick plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Highlights Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT APPLIED The IASB and IFRIC have issued a number of new standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
The Directors are in the process of assessing the impact on the Groups and Companys financial statements and do not consider that those standards which became effective on 1 January 2016 will have a material effect on the net assets, results and disclosures of the Group.
The standards not applied are as follows: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRSs Effective date Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle 1 January 2016 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement 1 January 2018 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements amendment application of consolidation exemption 1 January 2016 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements amendment 1 January 2016 IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities amendment 1 January 2016 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers including amendments 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements amendment 1 January 2016 IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows amendment 1 January 2017 IAS 12 Income Taxes amendment 1 January 2017 IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment amendment 1 January 2016 IAS 19 Employee Benefits amendment 1 January 2016 IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements amendment 1 January 2016 IAS 28 Investment in Associates amendment 1 January 2018 IAS 38 Intangible Assets amendment 1 January 2016 IAS 41 Agriculture amendment 1 January 2016 The effective dates stated above are those given in the original IASB IFRIC standards and interpretations.
As the Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, the application of new standards and interpretations will be subject to their having been endorsed for use in the EU via the EU Endorsement mechanism.
In the majority of cases this will result in an effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation but the need for endorsement restricts the Groups discretion to early adopt standards.
The Group has not early adopted any of the above standards.
REVENUE Revenue is recognised to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue and any associated costs can be measured reliably.
Revenue on the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer on despatch and represents the value of sales to customers net of discounts, similar allowances and estimates of returns and excludes value added tax.
Sales related discounts and similar allowances comprise: Long-term discounts and rebates which are sales incentives to customers to encourage them to purchase increased volumes and are related to total volumes purchased and sales growth.
Short-term promotional discounts which are directly related to promotions run by customers.
For sales related discounts that must be earned, management make estimates related to customer performance, sales volume and agreed terms, to determine total amounts earned and to be recorded in deductions from revenue.
NON-GAAP MEASURES ADJUSTED GROUP OPERATING PROFIT, ADJUSTED PROFIT BEFORE TAX AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE Adjusted Group operating profit, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share are defined as being before net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets, impairment charges and other significant non-trading items being amortisation of acquired customer relationship intangibles.
These additional non-GAAP measures of performance are included as the Directors believe that they provide a useful alternative measure for shareholders of the trading performance of the Group.
The reconciliation between Group operating profit and adjusted Group operating profit is shown on the face of the Group income statement.
TAXATION Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences: i except where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and ii in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Cranswick plc 91 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised: i except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and ii in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income taxes relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and not in the income statement.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
DIVIDENDS Dividends receivable by the Company are recognised in the income statement if they are declared, appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity paying the dividend, prior to the balance sheet date.
Dividends payable by the Company are recognised when declared and therefore final dividends proposed after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
Dividends paid to Shareholders are shown as a movement in equity rather than on the face of the income statement.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in profit or loss.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid for a business over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is capitalised and subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
When an entity is disposed of, any goodwill associated with it is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal except that goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 31 March 2004 which was previously deducted from equity is not recycled through the income statement.
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised at fair value separately from goodwill only if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition and the future economic benefits are expected to flow to the Group.
Customer relationships are amortised evenly over their expected useful lives of five years, with amortisation charged through administration expenses in the income statement.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are included at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is charged on property, plant and equipment on the depreciable amount, being cost less the estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, or the estimated useful economic lives of their individual parts.
Useful economic lives are principally as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Short leasehold improvements Remainder of lease Plant and equipment 5-11 years Motor vehicles 4 years The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment individually or at the cash-generating unit level when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
CAPITALISED BORROWING COSTS Borrowing costs incurred in financing the construction of qualifying assets such as property, plant and equipment are capitalised up to the date at which the relevant asset is substantially complete.
Borrowing costs are calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowing during the period of capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are expensed as incurred.
INVESTMENTS Investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.
92 Cranswick plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Highlights Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES i Finance leases Assets which are financed by leasing agreements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, in Property, plant and equipment and the corresponding capital cost is shown as an obligation to the lessor in Borrowings.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the term of the lease.
The interest element of the rental obligations is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remainder of the capital amount outstanding.
ii Operating leases Leases, which are not finance leases, are classified as operating leases.
Lease payments are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
GOVERNMENT GRANTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS UK Regional Development Grants and grants receivable from the European Union and DEFRA in respect of property, plant and equipment are credited to deferred income and released to the income statement over the relevant depreciation period.
INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in, first out basis and net realisable value after making allowance for any obsolete or slowmoving items.
In the case of finished goods, cost comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing fixed and variable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
BIOLOGICAL ASSETS The Groups biological assets consist of pigs in the form of breeding sows classified as non-current assets and their progeny for processing within the Group and externally classified as current assets.
On initial recognition and at the balance sheet date biological assets have been measured at their fair value less costs to sell, in line with IAS 41.
Gains and losses in relation to the fair value of biological assets are recognised in the income statement, within cost of sales, in the period in which they arise.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents are defined as cash at bank and in hand including short-term deposits with original maturity within three months.
For the purposes of the Group cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS i Debt instruments, including bank borrowings Debt instruments are initially recognised at the fair value of net proceeds received after the deduction of issue costs.
Subsequently debt instruments are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Issue costs are charged to the income statement over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the balance sheet carrying amount under the effective interest method.
ii Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its cash flow risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The fair value of forward contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with a similar maturity profile.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Where derivatives meet the hedging criteria under IAS 39 for cash flow hedges the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Gains or losses recognised in comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the net profit or loss.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to net profit or loss for the period.
FINANCIAL ASSETS LOANS AND RECEIVABLES Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES In the accounts of each entity in the Group, individual transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency at the actual exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Profits and losses on settlement of individual foreign currency transactions and movements on monetary assets and liabilities are dealt with in the income statement.
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Cranswick plc 93 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED EMPLOYEE BENEFITS i Pensions A subsidiary of the Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme for certain employees which requires contributions to be made to a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme was closed to new members on 30 June 2004.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised past-service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in Sterling, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
The amounts charged to operating profit are any gains and losses on settlements and curtailments, and these are included as part of staff costs.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension scheme are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
The difference between the interest cost on plan liabilities and the expected return on plan assets is recognised in the income statement as other finance revenue or costs.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The Group also operates defined contribution schemes for employees under which contributions are paid into schemes managed by major insurance companies.
Contributions are calculated as a percentage of employees earnings and obligations for contributions to the schemes are recognised as cost of sales or operating expenses in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
ii Equity settled share-based payments The Group operates a savings related share option scheme under which options have been granted to Group employees SAYE scheme.
In addition, the Group operates an Executive share option scheme albeit currently not in use and a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for senior Executives.
Share options awarded are exercisable subject to the attainment of certain market-based and non-market-based performance criteria.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service and performance vesting conditions, other than performance conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
Any other conditions which are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered to be non-vesting conditions.
Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or nonvesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance or service conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period.
In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification.
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled including when a non-vesting condition within the control of the entity or employee is not met, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately.
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
On transition to IFRS, the Group did not apply the measurement rules of IFRS 2 to equity settled awards granted before 7 November 2002 or granted after that date and vested before 1 January 2005.
However, later modifications of such equity instruments are measured under IFRS 2.
94 Cranswick plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Highlights Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 3. BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHICAL SEGMENTS IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of the internal financial information reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The Groups CODM is deemed to be the Executive Directors on the Board, who are primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments.
The CODM assesses profit performance using profit before taxation measured on a basis consistent with the disclosure in the Group accounts.
The Group reports on one reportable segment: Food manufacture and supply of food products to UK grocery retailers, the food service sector and other food producers.
All Group revenues are received for the provision of goods: no revenues are received from the provision of services.

Including these sales, total sales to export markets were 53,366,000 for the year 2015: 47,297,000.
CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION The Group has two customers 2015: three which individually account for more than 10 per cent of the Groups total revenue.
These customers account for 24 per cent and 23 per cent respectively.
In the prior year these same two customers plus one other accounted for 23 per cent, 25 per cent and 11 per cent respectively.
The Groups non-current assets were all located within the UK for both 2016 and 2015.
GROUP OPERATING PROFIT Group operating costs comprise: 2016 2015 000 000 Cost of sales excluding net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets 925,918 878,968 Net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets 951 4,245 Cost of sales 926,869 883,213 Gross profit 142,735 120,123 Selling and distribution costs 42,814 38,418 Administrative expenses excluding amortisation of customer relationship intangible assets and impairment of goodwill 34,683 27,297 Amortisation of customer relationship intangible assets 1,396 671 Impairment of goodwill 4,635 Administrative expenses 40,714 27,968 Total operating costs 1,010,397 949,599 This represents the difference between operating profit prepared under IAS 41 and operating profit prepared under historical cost accounting, which forms part of the reconciliation to adjusted operating profit.

There are no income tax consequences for the Group in relation to dividends paid to Shareholders.
E CHANGE IN CORPORATION TAX RATE A reduction in the main rate of corporation tax in the UK from 20 per cent to 18 per cent from 1 April 2018 was enacted before the balance sheet date.

EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to members of the parent company of 45,395,000 2015: 41,252,000 by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.
In calculating diluted earnings per share amounts, the weighted average number of shares is adjusted for the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares for both basic and diluted amounts was as per the table below: 2016 2015 Thousands Thousands Basic weighted average number of shares 49,601 49,071 Dilutive potential ordinary shares share options 191 151 49,792 49,222 ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE The Directors consider it appropriate to present an adjusted measure of earnings per share on the face of the income statement which excludes certain non-cash items to provide a more meaningful measure of the underlying performance of the business.
These items include impairment of goodwill Note 11, the amortisation of customer relationship intangible assets Note 11 and gains and losses from the IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets due to the volatility of pig prices Note 15.
Adjusted earnings per share are calculated using the weighted average number of shares for both basic and diluted amounts as detailed above.
Adjusted profit for the year is derived as follows: 2016 2015 000 000 Profit for the year 45,395 41,252 Impairment of goodwill 4,635 Amortisation of customer relationship intangible assets 1,396 671 Tax on amortisation of customer relationship intangible assets 251 134 Net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets 951 4,245 Tax on net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets 171 849 Adjusted profit for the year 51,955 45,185 11.

Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to the following principal cash-generating units: 2016 2015 Cash-generating unit 000 000 Fresh pork 12,231 12,231 Livestock 1,691 1,691 Cooked meats 90,167 90,167 Sandwiches 6,967 11,602 Continental Fine Foods 10,968 10,968 Premium cooked poultry 9,259 9,259 Other 3,756 3,756 135,039 139,674 Assumptions used The recoverable amount for each cash-generating unit has been determined based on value in use calculations using annual budgets for each business for the following year, approved by the Board of Directors, and cash flow projections for the next four years.
Forecast replacement capital expenditure is included from budgets and thereafter capital is assumed to represent 100 per cent of depreciation.
Subsequent cash flows are forecast to grow in line with an assumed long-term industry growth rate of between 3 and 5 per cent derived from third party market information, including Kantar Worldpanel data.
A pre-tax discount rate of 7.0 per cent has been used 2015: 6.5 per cent being managements estimate of the weighted average cost of capital.
The calculation is most sensitive to the following assumptions: Sales volumes Sales volumes are influenced by the growth of the underlying food segment, the market shares of our customers, selling prices and the quality of our products and service.
Historical volumes are used as the base and adjusted over the projection period in line with current growth rates.
Gross margin Gross margin depends upon average selling prices, the cost of raw materials and changes in the cost of production overheads.
Historical margins are used as the base, adjusted for managements expectations derived from experience and with reference to budget forecasts.
Discount rates All calculations of this nature are sensitive to the discount rate used.
Managements estimate of the weighted average cost of capital has been used for each cash-generating unit.
Sensitivity Management believes that currently there is no reasonably possible change to the assumptions that would reduce the value in use below the value of the carrying amount for any of the Groups cash-generating units.
Assumptions and projections are updated on an annual basis.
Impairment of Sandwiches cash-generating unit Following a change in the customer base of the Sandwiches category, an impairment review was performed on the Sandwiches cash-generating unit as at 30 September 2015.
This cash-generating unit had historically been the most sensitive to a reasonably possible change in assumptions.
The recoverable amount for the Sandwiches cash-generating unit was determined based on value in use calculations.
The projected cash flows were updated to reflect the latest Sandwiches forecasts for the years ending 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2017 and cash flow projections for the next three years.
Forecast replacement capital expenditure was included from forecasts and thereafter capital spend was assumed to represent 100 per cent of depreciation.
Subsequent cash flows were forecast to grow in line with an assumed long-term industry growth rate of 3 per cent derived from third party market information, including Kantar Worldpanel data.
A pre-tax discount rate of 7.7 per cent was used, being managements estimate of the weighted average cost of capital.
Based on these calculations, which gave a value in use below the value of the carrying amount, the Group recognised an impairment charge within administrative expenses for goodwill allocated to the Sandwiches cash-generating unit of 4,635,000 2015: nil.
Following the recognition of this impairment the carrying amount of the Sandwiches cash-generating unit was the same as the recoverable amount of 8.9 million, so any further adverse change in key assumptions would lead to an additional impairment charge.
A similar exercise was carried out at the year end and this gave a value in use above the value of the carrying amount.
It was therefore concluded that no further impairment was required.

Cost includes 1,082,000 2015: 1,082,000 in respect of capitalised interest.
No interest was capitalised during the year 2015: nil.
The rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation was 1.75 per cent, which was the effective rate of the borrowing used to finance the construction.
The Directors believe that the fair value of the property, plant and equipment is not materially different to the net book amounts presented above.

In April 2009 the Group disposed of its pet and aquatics segment, retaining a 5.5 per cent share of both businesses.
Following a subsequent reorganisation Cranswick plc sold its 5.5 per cent investment in the pet products business.
The transaction resulted in the Group retaining its 5.5 per cent interest in the aquatics business, this interest was later reduced to a 3.3 per cent holding of Tropical Marine Centre 2012 Limited following a further reorganisation and change in major shareholders.
The investment, being an unquoted entity, the value of which cannot be reliably measured, is held at a carrying value of nil.

ACQUISITIONS 2015 BENSON PARK LIMITED On 22 October 2014, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Benson Park Limited for a total consideration of 23.8 million.
The principal activity of Benson Park Limited is the production of premium British cooked poultry.
The acquisition moves the Group into a new protein sector and further broadens its product range and customer base.
Fair values of the net assets at the date of acquisition were as follows: Fair value 000 Net assets acquired: Customer relationships 6,185 Property, plant and equipment 4,931 Inventories 2,190 Trade receivables 6,224 Bank and cash balances 2,308 Trade payables 5,013 Government grants 465 Corporation tax liability 373 Deferred tax liability 1,339 Finance lease obligations 135 14,513 Goodwill arising on acquisition 9,259 Total consideration 23,772 Satisfied by: Cash 20,000 Contingent consideration 3,772 23,772 Analysis of cash flows on acquisition: Included within cash flows from investing activities Cash consideration paid 20,000 Cash and cash equivalents acquired 2,308 17,692 Included within net cash from operating activities Transaction costs of the acquisition 203 Net cash outflow arising on acquisition 17,895 In the prior year, from the date of acquisition to 31 March 2015, the external revenues of Benson Park Limited were 18.1 million and the Company contributed a net profit after tax of 1.1 million to the Group.
If Benson Park Limited had been acquired at the beginning of the prior year, the Groups profit after tax for the prior year would have been 42.8 million and revenues would have been 1,026.6 million.
Included in the 9.3 million of goodwill recognised are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated from the acquiree and reliably measured due to their nature.
These items include the expected value of synergies and the assembled workforce.
Transaction costs of 0.2 million were expensed in relation to the acquisition and were included in administrative expenses.
All of the trade receivables acquired were collected in full.
CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION The agreement includes contingent consideration payable in cash to the previous owners of Benson Park Limited based on the performance of the business over a 2.5-year period.
The amount payable will be between nil and 4.0 million dependant on the average profit before interest and tax of the business during the 2.5-year period versus an agreed target level.
The fair value of the contingent consideration on acquisition was estimated at 4.0 million, discounted to 3.8 million in the table above.

The proportion of the Groups net assets denominated in foreign currencies is immaterial.
The Groups other financial assets and liabilities are denominated in Sterling.
CREDIT RISK The Group makes a significant proportion of its sales to the major UK supermarket groups, which correspondingly represent a significant proportion of the Groups trade receivables at any one time.
Based on the financial strength of these customers, the Directors do not consider that the Group faces a significant credit risk in this regard.
Debts with other customers, which represent a smaller proportion of the Groups trade receivables, are considered to provide greater risk, particularly in the current economic climate.
These debts are reviewed on a regular basis by credit controllers and senior management and prudent provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
All cash financial assets are held by UK financial institutions.
The maximum credit exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their carrying values as at the balance sheet date.
FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: o ther techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the end of the reporting period.
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Cranswick plc 111 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 22.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The Groups forward currency contracts are measured using Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The valuations are provided by the Groups bankers from the proprietary valuations models and are based on mid-market levels as at close of business on the Groups year end reporting date.
Contingent consideration is measured using Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and relates to future amounts payable on acquisitions.
Amounts payable are based on agreements within purchase contracts, managements expectations of the future profitability of the acquired entity and the timings of payments.
The Groups 3.3 per cent retained shareholding in the aquatics business Tropical Marine Centre 2012 Limited would have been classified as Level 3: however, as the investment is an unquoted entity and cannot be reliably measured, the Directors consider that its value is immaterial and no fair value has been applied.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties on an arms length basis.

PENSION SCHEMES DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION SCHEME The Group acquired a defined benefit final salary pension scheme during 2009, which is funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The scheme was closed to new members and future accrual on 30 June 2004.
Pension costs are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary on the basis of a triennial valuation using the projected unit credit method.
The latest available formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2013.
This valuation was updated to the year end.
Plan assets are stated at fair value at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published brokers forecasts to each category of scheme assets.
