I II III Financial Statements 23 Financial instruments and Risk The Strategic Report details the Companys approach to investment risk management on pages 18 and 19 and the accounting policies on pages 59 to 64 explain the basis on which currencies and investments are valued for accounting purposes.
The Directors are of the opinion that the fair values of financial assets and liabilities of the Group are not materially different to their carrying values.
Capital Risk Management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group and the Company will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the use of debt and equity balances.
The Group's and Companys overall strategy remains unchanged from the year ended 31 December 2015.
The capital structure of the Group and the Company consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 15, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Note 17 to the financial statements.
The Board reviews the capital structure of the Company and the Group on an at least a semi-annual basis.
The Group and the Company have decided that net gearing should at no time exceed 30% of the net assets of either the Group or the Company.
Risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust the Company invests in equities, private equity, financial instruments and its subsidiary businesses for the long term in order to achieve the investment objectives set out on page 5.
In pursuing these objectives the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for payment as dividends.
The principal financial instruments at risk comprise those in the Companys investment portfolio and this note addresses these risks below.
The Group has certain additional risks, and these are detailed in the appropriate sections below.
These risks and the Directors approach to managing them are set out below under the following headings: market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk, and other price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and gearing risk.
The Group has a risk management framework in place which is described in detail on pages 22 to 24.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to measure the risks have not changed from the previous accounting year.
23.1 Market Risk Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and includes currency risk see note 23.2, interest rate risk see note 23.3 and other price risk see note 23.4.
Market risk is managed on a regular basis by ATI in its role as AIFM.
ATI manages the capital of the Company within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
These activities performed by ATI are overseen by the Board Management Engagement Committee.
The Companys strategy on investment risk is outlined in our statement of investment objectives and policy on page 5.
Details of the investment portfolio at the balance sheet date are disclosed on pages 18 to 19.
23.2 Currency Risk Some of the Groups assets, liabilities and transactions are denominated in currencies other than its functional currency of Sterling.
Consequently the Group is exposed to the risk that movements in exchange rates may affect the Sterling value of those items.
The Groups currency holdings and gains losses thereon are reviewed regularly by the Directors, and the currency risk is managed on a regular basis by ATI within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
The Group enters into forward exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency exposure.
The currency exposure for overseas investments is based on the quotation currency of each holding, while the currency exposure for net monetary assets is based on the currency in which each asset or liability is denominated.
At the reporting date the Group and Company had the following exposures: Alliance Trust PLC | Annual Report and Financial Accounts 2016 79 Financial Statements 23 Financial instruments and Risk 23.2 Currency Risk Group and Company Currency Exposure Total Total Overseas Net monetary currency Overseas Net monetary currency investments assets exposure investments assets exposure 000 Dec 16 Dec 16 Dec 16 Dec 15 Dec 15 Dec 15 US dollar 1,760,969 240 1,761,209 1,481,269 740 1,482,009 Euro 399,530 - 399,530 396,450 - 396,450 Yen 173,188 - 173,188 178,833 - 178,833 Other non-sterling 514,158 - 514,158 437,114 - 437,114 2,493,666 740 2,494,406 2,847,845 240 2,848,085 Sensitivity analysis If Sterling had strengthened by 10% 5% relative to all currencies, with all other variables held constant, the income statement and the net assets attributable to equity holders of the parent would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
The analysis is performed on the same basis as for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The revenue return impact is an estimated figure for 12 months based on the cash balances at the reporting date.

23.3 Interest Rate Risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in a number of ways.
A movement in interest rates may affect the fair value of investments in fixed interest rate securities, income receivable on cash deposits and interest payable on variable rate borrowings.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels which are approved and monitored by the Board.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows as a result of an interest rate change are taken into account when making investment or borrowing decisions.
The following table details the Groups and Companys exposure to interest rate risks for bank and loan balances: Group Company 000 Dec 16 Dec 15 Dec 16 Dec 15 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash at bank 51,094 25,153 49,430 16,967 Bank loans repayable within one year 120,000 290,000 120,000 290,000 68,906 264,847 70,570 273,033 Sensitivity analysis If interest rates had decreased by 0.25% 0.25%, with all other variables held constant, the income statement result and the net assets attributable to equity holders of the parent would have increased by the amounts shown below.

As the majority of the Groups financial assets are carried at fair value with fair value changes recognised in the income statement, all changes in market conditions will directly affect gains and losses on investments and net assets.
The Directors manage price risk by having a suitable investment objective for the Company.
The Board reviews this objective and investment performance regularly.
The risk is managed on a regular basis by ATI within parameters set by the Directors on investment and asset allocation strategies and risk.
Concentration of exposure to other price risks A listing of the Companys equity investment portfolio is shown on pages 18 to 19.
The largest amount of equity investments by value is in North America, with significant amounts also in Europe, Asia and the UK.
It also shows the concentration of investments in various sectors.
The following table details the Groups exposure to market price risk on its quoted and unquoted equity investments: Group Company 000 Dec 16 Dec 15 Dec 16 Dec 15 Investments at fair value through Profit & Loss Listed 3,157,042 2,930,872 3,157,042 2,930,872 Foreign exchange contracts 6,853 - 6,853 - Unlisted 47,444 47,778 47,444 47,778 Investments in Collective Investment Schemes 93,027 158,009 93,027 158,009 Investments in Related and Subsidiary Companies 169,799 170,738 169,831 173,012 3,474,165 3,307,397 3,474,197 3,309,671 Sensitivity analysis 93.7% 93.3% of the Companys investment portfolio is listed on stock exchanges.
If share prices had decreased by 10% with all other variables remaining constant, the income statement result and the net assets attributable to equity holders of the parent would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
The analysis for last year assumed a share price decrease of 10%.

23.5 Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
This risk is managed as follows: Investment transactions are carried out with a number of well established, approved brokers.
Investment transactions are carried out on a cash against receipt or cash against delivery basis The Group minimises credit risk through banking polices which restrict banking deposits to highly rated financial institutions.
The policies also set maximum exposure to individual banks.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate cash and gilts as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
At the reporting date, the Groups and Company's cash and cash equivalents exposed to credit risk were as follows: Group Company 000 Dec 16 Dec 15 Dec 16 Dec 15 Credit Rating Aa1 47,879 15,248 47,879 15,248 A3 3,215 9,905 1,551 1,719 51,094 25,153 49,430 16,967 Average maturity 1 day 1 day 1 day 1 day The Companys UK listed equities and its overseas listed equities are held by Bank of New York Mellon as custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Groups rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed or limited.
23.6 Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities.
This is not a significant risk for the Company as the majority of its assets are investments in quoted equities that are readily realisable.
It also has the ability to borrow, which gives it access to additional funding when required.
At the balance sheet date it had the following facilities: 000 Dec 16 Expires Dec 15 Expires Committed multi currency facility - RBS 100,000 100,000 31 12 2018 Amount drawn - - - - Committed multi currency facility - RBS - - Amount drawn - - - - Committed multi currency facility - RBS 50,000 31 12 2016 50,000 31 12 2016 Amount drawn - - - - Committed multi currency facility - RBS 100,000 31 03 2017 100,000 31 03 2017 Amount drawn 100,000 - 90,000 - Committed multi currency facility - Scotiabank 100,000 27 03 2018 100,000 27 03 2018 Amount drawn 20,000 - 100,000 - Alliance Trust PLC | Annual Report and Financial Accounts 2016 82 I II III Financial Statements 23 Financial instruments and Risk 23.6 Liquidity Risk 000 Dec 16 Expires Dec 15 Expires Committed multi currency facility - Scotiabank - - Amount drawn - - - - Committed multi currency facility - Scotiabank 100,000 22 12 2017 100,000 22 12 2017 Amount drawn - - 100,000 - Unsecured fixed rate loan notes 100,000 31 07 2029 100,000 31 07 2029 Amount drawn 100,000 - 100,000 - Total facilities 550,000 550,000 Total drawn 220,000 - 390,000 - All the facilities are unsecured and have covenants on the maximum level of gearing and minimum net asset value of the Company.
The fair value of fixed rate loan notes is shown in note 15.
23.7 Gearing Risk This is the risk that the movement in the fair value of the assets of the Company is amplified by any gearing that the Company may have.
The exposure to this risk and the sensitivity analysis is detailed below.
Group Company 000 Dec 16 Dec 15 Dec 16 Dec 15 Investments after gearing 3,474,165 3,307,397 3,474,197 3,309,671 Gearing 238,800 399,000 238,800 399,000 Investments before gearing 3,235,365 2,908,397 3,235,397 2,910,671 Gearing is expressed as debt at fair value Sensitivity analysis If net assets before gearing had decreased by 10%, with all other variables held constant, the income statement result and the net assets attributable to equity holders of the parent would have further decreased by the amounts shown below.
The analysis for last year assumed a net assets before gearing decrease of 10%.

23.8 Hierarchical Valuation of Financial Instruments The Group refines and modifies its valuation techniques as markets develop.
While the Group believes its valuation techniques to be appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could result in different estimates of fair value at the balance sheet date.
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs The following table analyses the fair value measurements for the Group's and Company's assets and liabilities measured by the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is categorised at 31 December 2016.
All fair value measurements disclosed are recurring fair value measurements.
Fair Value Assets in Level 1 The quoted market price used for financial investments held by the Group is the current bid price.
These investments are included within Level 1 and comprise equities, bonds and exchange traded derivatives.
Fair Value Assets in Level 2 The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and with minimal reliance on entity specific estimates.
Fair Value Assets in Level 3 Level 3, excluding the valuations of the subsidiaries, are reviewed at least annually by the Valuation Committee of ATI.
The valuations of the two trading subsidiaries, ATI and ATS are reviewed at least annually by the Audit and Risk Committee with valuations recommended to the Board of the Company.
The ATI Valuation Committee considers the appropriateness of the valuation models, inputs, using the various valuation methods in accordance with the Group's valuation policy.
The Committee will determine the appropriateness of any valuation of the underlying assets.
The following table shows the reconciliation from the beginning balances to the ending balances for fair value measurement in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

This includes a valuation of ATS at 61.5m 54.0m.
This represents the Directors' view of the amount for which the subsidiary could be exchanged between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm's length transaction.
This does not assume that the Company currently has any intention to sell the subsidiary business in the future.
The Directors have used several valuation methodologies as prescribed in the guidelines to arrive at their best estimate of fair value including discounted cash flow calculations, revenue and earnings multiples and recent market transactions where available.
For 31 December 2016 the fair valuation of ATI is based on the recently announced transaction to sell ATI to Liontrust Asset Management PLC.
The valuation is based on the fair value of Liontrust shares to be used to fund the transaction and the expected net asset value of ATI excluding any contingent amounts.
note 10 The following key assumptions are relevant to the fair valuation of our investment in our subsidiary companies, and are consistent with prior years: Alliance Trust Savings - This is valued as a trading business.
For the fair valuation of ATS at 31 December 2016 the Audit and Risk Committee took advice from an external valuer in arriving at the fair value of ATS.
The Audit and Risk Committee challenged the range of values provided and after fully reviewing the methodology and assumptions the Committee approved the reported valuation.
An internal model prepared by management using a discounted cash flow has been used for comparative purposes.
The multiples applied in valuing our subsidiary are derived from comparable companies sourced from market data.
Mineral rights are carried at fair value and are valued in the Companys accounts at 13.2m 17.5m being the Directors' estimate of their fair value, using the guidelines and methodologies on valuation published by the Oklahoma Tax Commission and for non-producing properties, the Lierle US Price Report.
The table below details how an increase or decrease in the respective input variables would impact the valuation disclosed for the relevant Level 3 assets.

For Mineral rights, an increase in the revenue multiple and average bonus multiple would lead to an increase in the estimated value.
For the 31 December 2016 and 2015 fair valuations of ATS the Board has taken advice from an external valuer.
This approach was taken subsequent to the purchase of Stocktrade and the decision to use an external valuer is to apply a degree of independence and external challenge into the valuation.
The external valuation was compared against internal valuations models prepared by management.
Private equity investments, both fund-to-fund and direct included under Level 3, are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines issued in December 2015.
Unlisted investments in private equity are stated at the valuation as determined by the Valuation Committee based on information provided by the General Partner.
The General Partners policy in valuing unlisted investments is to carry them at fair value.
The General Partner will generally rely on the fund's investment managers fair value at the last reported period, rolled forward for any cashflows.
However if the General Partner does not feel the manager is reflecting a fair value they will select a valuation methodology that is most appropriate for the particular investments in that fund and generate a fair Alliance Trust PLC | Annual Report and Financial Accounts 2016 85
