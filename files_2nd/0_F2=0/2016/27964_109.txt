OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMPANY INFORMATION 25. Business acquisition continued v Meritus and GMA On 23 July 2014, Paysafe Group, through its subsidiaries, Paysafe Services US Corp and Paysafe Services US LLC formerly NBX Services Corp and NetBX Services LLC respectively, acquired all of the partnership interests of Paysafe Partners L. P. formerly TK Global Partners L. P. doing business as Meritus Payment Solutions or Meritus, a California-based payment processing entity.
The total consideration agreed upon of $210,000,000 on the closing date consisted of $150,000,000 in cash and $60,000,000 of Paysafe Group plc shares and or cash to be issued in equal tranches over four years commencing on the first anniversary of the closing date, subject to customary closing adjustments share consideration payable.
Concurrent with the execution of the Meritus purchase agreement, Paysafe Services US Corp. bought all the outstanding limited and general partnership interest of Meritus in Global Merchant Advisors, Inc. GMA, a US-based online payments company.
At closing date, the number of Paysafe Group shares equal to $60,000,000 was determined to be 8,954,621 shares, and the estimated fair value of this share consideration payable determined through single-factor Monte Carlo valuation model was $76,090,000.
On the same date, Paysafe Services US LLC acquired the trade and assets of GMA for $15,000,000 in cash, $10,000,000 of which was paid at closing date and the balance of $5,000,000 to be paid based on future performance of the business contingent consideration.
As the minimum performance targets were met during the year ended 31 December 2015, the contingent consideration was paid for the full amount of $5,000,000.
Financial instruments The Group classifies its financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, or as loans and receivables and other financial liabilities measured at amortised cost depending on the purpose for which the financial assets and liabilities were acquired or incurred.
Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition.
All financial assets and liabilities designated as fair value through profit or loss are measured at their fair values and gains and losses related to periodic revaluations are recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
All financial assets designated as loans and receivables, as well as financial liabilities designated as other financial liabilities, are initially measured at their fair values and subsequently at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, settlement assets, restricted cash, cash held as reserves, trade receivables, merchant processing liabilities, trade and other payables, long-term debt, contingent consideration, deferred consideration payable, share consideration payable and derivative financial liabilities.
All financial instruments are classified as fair value through profit or loss except for trade receivables, trade and other payables and long-term debt which are classified as loans and receivables and other financial liabilities.
Long-term debt is recognised initially at fair value, net of financing fees incurred which are comprised primarily of legal, accounting and other costs directly attributable to the issuance of the long-term debt.
Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of financing fees and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the term of the long-term debt using the effective interest rate method.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest rate method.
Share consideration payable meets the definition of a financial liability under IAS 32 and is therefore classified as such.
The fair value of share consideration payable is determined through single-factor Monte Carlo valuation model at the reporting date.
Any fair value gains and losses at the reporting date are recognised as a net fair value gain or loss on share consideration payable in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Trade and other payables and long-term debt are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less.
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Financial assets will be derecognised if the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the asset is transferred and the transfer qualifies for derecognition.
The transfer qualifies for derecognition if substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.
com 133 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2016 tabular amounts only are in thousands of US dollars, except per share data 26.
Financial instruments continued Fair value measurements are categorised in accordance with the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, but that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
i Fair values The Group estimates the fair value of its financial instruments based on current interest rates, market value and pricing of financial instruments with comparable terms.
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, settlement assets, restricted cash, cash held as reserves, trade receivables, contingent consideration, deferred consideration payable, merchant processing liabilities, and trade and other payables approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
The carrying value of long-term debt also approximates its fair value as there has been no significant movement in counterparty credit risk and market interest rates for debts and leases with similar maturity dates and terms.
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy.
Carrying value Fair value Fair value level Other financial Held-for-trading liabilities $ $ $ As at 31 December 2016 Financial instruments measured at fair value Share consideration payable 32,284 32,284 Level 2 Derivative financial liabilities 1,665 1,665 Level 2 33,949 33,949 Carrying value Fair value Fair value level Other financial Held-for-trading liabilities $ $ $ As at 31 December 2015 Financial instruments measured at fair value Share consideration payable 62,386 62,386 Level 2 Derivative financial liabilities 229 229 Level 2 62,615 62,615 There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 for the years ending 31 December 2016 and 2015. ii Credit risk and concentrations Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a member or merchant counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups cash and cash equivalents, settlement assets, restricted cash, cash held as reserves and trade receivables.
The cash and cash equivalents, settlement assets, restricted cash and cash held as reserves are deposited with major financial institutions which the Groups management believes to be financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit risks exist with respect to these assets.
The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent that its members and merchants may charge back credit card purchases.
The Group manages the exposure to credit risk by employing various online identification verification techniques, enacted transaction limits and having a significant number of members and merchants.
As these members are geographically widespread and the merchants are active in various industries, the exposure to credit risk and concentration is mitigated.

Financial instruments continued As at the reporting date, the maximum credit exposure of the Groups financial assets exposed to credit risk amounted to the following: Neither past due Past due: Past due: Past due: more or impaired 1-30 days 31-90 days than 90 days $ $ $ $ As at 31 December 2016 Cash and cash equivalents 231,157 Settlement assets 64,586 Restricted cash 31,854 Cash held as reserves 35,873 Trade receivables 27,886 277 418 1,162 Total 391,356 277 418 1,162 Neither past due Past due: Past due: Past due: more or impaired 1-30 days 31-90 days than 90 days $ $ $ $ As at 31 December 2015 Cash and cash equivalents 117,875 Settlement assets 51,868 Restricted cash 29,070 Cash held as reserves 14,473 Trade receivables 15,299 1,859 450 383 Total 228,585 1,859 450 383 The movement in the impairment allowance for trade receivables was as follows: $ Balance at 1 January 2015 2,294 Impairment allowance acquired Note 25 3,465 Impairment loss recognised during the year 7,743 Amounts written-off Balance at 31 December 2015 13,502 Impairment loss recognised during the year 2,105 Amounts written-off Balance at 31 December 2016 15,607 iii Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that investment revenue earned on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, and interest expense incurred on long-term debt are subject to fluctuations in interest rates.
The Groups exposure to interest rate risk is limited as investments are held in liquid and short-term funds.
In addition, an interest rate swap has been entered into in order to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising on the Term A facility, for which a loss of $1,652,000 2015: $299,000 was recorded during the year.
The Group is also investigating hedging strategies to further reduce the risk from interest rate volatility in future years.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed wherein a 1% increase in interest rates offered would result in a $489,000 31 December 2015: $1,344,000 unfavourable impact on net earnings while a 1% decrease would result in a $2,384,000 unfavourable 31 December 2015: $2,318,000 favourable impact on net earnings related to the Groups borrowings.
iv Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk due to financial assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, primarily the Great Britain Pound GBP, the Euro EUR, the Canadian Dollar CAD, and the Hong Kong Dollar HKD.
The Group manages the exposure to currency risk by commercially transacting in US dollars and by limiting the use of other currencies for operating expenses, wherever possible, thereby minimising the realised and unrealised foreign exchange gain loss.
