Underlying revenue growth Underlying growth in revenue is used to compare the revenue in a given year to the previous year on a like-for-like basis.
This is achieved by adjusting for the impact of sales of products acquired in material business combinations or disposed of and for movements in exchange rates.
Underlying growth in revenue is not presented in the accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS and is therefore a measure not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles a non-GAAP measure.
Underlying growth in revenue is considered by the Group to be an important measure of performance in terms of local functional currency since LW H[FOXGHV WKRVH LWHPV FRQVLGHUHG WR EH RXWVLGH WKH LQXHQFH RI ORFDO PDQDJHPHQW 7KH URXSV PDQDJHPHQW XVHV WKLV QRQ $$3 PHDVXUH LQ LWV LQWHUQDO QDQFLDO UHSRUWLQJ EXGJHWLQJ DQG SODQQLQJ WR DVVHVV SHUIRUPDQFH RQ ERWK D EXVLQHVV DQG D FRQVROLGDWHG URXS EDVLV 5HYHQXH JURZWK DWFRQVWDQW FXUUHQF LV LPSRUWDQW LQ PHDVXULQJ EXVLQHVV SHUIRUPDQFH FRPSDUHG WR FRPSHWLWRUV DQG FRPSDUHG WR WKH JURZWK RIWKH PDUNHW LWVHOI The Group considers that revenue from sales of products acquired in material business combinations results in a step-up in growth in revenue in the year of acquisition that cannot be wholly attributed to local managements efforts with respect to the business in the year of acquisition.
Depending on the timing of the acquisition, there will usually be a further step change in the following year.
A measure of growth excluding the effects of business combinations also allows senior management to evaluate the performance and relative impact of growth from the existing business and growth from acquisitions.
The process of making business acquisitions is directed, approved and funded from the Group corporate centre in line with strategic objectives.

The Group compensates for this limitation by taking into account relative movements in exchange rates in its investment, strategic planning and resource allocation.
In addition, as the evaluation and assessment of business acquisitions is not within the control of local management, performance of acquisitions is monitored centrally until the business is integrated.
The Groups management considers that the non-GAAP measure of underlying growth in revenue and the GAAP measure of growth in revenue are complementary measures, neither of which management uses exclusively.

The constant currency exchange effect is a measure of the increase decrease in revenue resulting from currency movements on non-US Dollar sales and is measured as the difference between: 1 the increase decrease in the current year revenue translated into US Dollars at the current year average exchange rate and the prior revenue translated at the prior year rate: and 2 the increase decrease being measured by translating current and prior year revenues into US Dollars using the prior year closing rate.
The acquisitions and disposals effect is the measure of the impact on revenue from newly acquired material business combinations and recent material business disposals.
This is calculated by comparing the current year, constant currency actual revenue which include acquisitions and exclude disposals from the relevant date of completion with prior year, constant currency actual revenue, adjusted to include the results of acquisitions and exclude disposals for the commensurate period in the prior year.

Established Markets had an underlying growth of 3% and Emerging Markets had an underlying growth of 11%, both of which contributed to the Group increase of 4%.
COST OF GOODS SOLD Cost of goods sold decreased by $19m, 2% on a reported basis, from $1,162m in 2014 to $1,143m in 2015.
The movement is primarily due to the strengthening of the US Dollar which more than offsets the increase in volume from acquisitions and underlying trading.
During 2015, no restructuring and rationalisation expenses 2014: $12m and acquisition related costs 2014: $23m were charged to cost of goods sold.

This is principally attributable to the following: Property, plant and equipment increased by $41m from $891m in 2014 to $932m in 2015.
There were $303m of additions together with $6m acquired with the Colombia and Russia acquisitions which were offset by $11m of assets disposed.
Depreciation of $226m was charged during 2015 and there were unfavourable currency movements of $31m.
This movement relates to additions of $10m from the acquisition in Colombia and $24m from the acquisition in Russia.
This was offset by unfavourable currency movements of $49m which decreased the overall goodwill balance.
Intangible assets decreased by $245m from $1,747m in 2014 to $1,502m in 2015.
There were additions of $55m in 2015 relating to intellectual property, distribution rights and software acquired together with $19m acquired with the Colombia and Russia acquisitions.
Amortisation and impairment during 2015 was $270m and there were unfavourable currency movements of $45m.

The movement relates to the following: Inventories rose by $36m to $1,217m in 2015 from $1,181m in 2014.
This movement is driven by inventory acquired with the Colombia and Russia acquisitions and a general increase across the Emerging Markets.
This was offset by unfavourable currency movements of $63m.
The level of trade and other receivables decreased by $28m to $1,138m in 2015 from $1,166m in 2014.
The movement primarily relates to the $17m increase in the bad debt provision as well as unfavourable currency movements.

Non-current liabilities Non-current liabilities decreased by $247m from $2,104m in 2014 to $1,857m in 2015.
This movement principally relates to: Long-term borrowing decreased from $1,666m in 2014 to $1,434m in 2015 principally due to repayments of bank debt.
