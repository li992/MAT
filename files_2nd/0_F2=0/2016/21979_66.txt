The fair value of listed bonds and other long-term borrowings is 14,500m 2014 15: 10,919m and the fair value of finance leases is 290m 2014 15: 273m.
The fair value of the groups bonds and other long-term borrowings is estimated on the basis of quoted market prices, based on the same or similar issues, where they exist.
Where the same or similar issues do not exist, the fair value is estimated based on the calculation of future cash flows using blended discount rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
The carrying amount of other loans and bank overdrafts equates to fair value due to the short maturity of these items.
The interest rates payable on loans and borrowings disclosed above reflect the coupons on the underlying issued loans and borrowings and not the interest rates achieved through applying associated cross-currency and interest rate swaps in hedge arrangements.
