We have a comprehensive set of policies, initiatives and frameworks to achieve this.
Examples include: Our Charter is central to everything we do and our single most important document at BHP Billiton.
Our Charter describes our purpose and values and how we measure our success.
It communicates who we are, what we do and what we stand for as an organisation.
It is the basis for our decision-making.
Our Requirements standards outline the expected actions and standards for those who work for or on behalf of BHP Billiton.
Some of those standards relate to people activities: for example, recruitment and talent retention.
Discrimination on any basis, including disability, is not acceptable.
In instances where employees require support for a disability, we work with them to identify roles that meet their skill, experience and capability, and offer retraining where required.
Our Code of Business Conduct helps guide our daily work.
It demonstrates how to practically apply the commitments and values set out in Our Charter and reflects many of the standards and procedures we apply throughout our organisation.
Our business conduct advisory service EthicsPoint and dispute and grievance handling processes are available to address issues across the Company.
We provide employees with access to an Employee Assistance Program EAP in each region where we operate.
The EAPs provide short-term assistance through free, confidential counselling and support services.
Our all-employee share purchase plan, Shareplus, is available to all permanent full-time and part-time employees, and those on fixed term contracts, except where local regulations limit operation of the scheme.
In these instances, alternate arrangements are in place.
