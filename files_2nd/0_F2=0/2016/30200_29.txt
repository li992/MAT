These items are not part of the Groups normal ongoing operations and are excluded from the Groups adjusted operating profit measure.
They typically relate to costs associated with acquisitions, gains or losses on disposal of investments, material restructuring costs and impairments.
Exceptional items are considered individually and assessed each reporting period.
2016 2015 Charged credited to continuing operating profit m m Advanstar integration costs 8.1 8.7 Business Journals Inc integration costs 3.2 Acquisition costs on Allworld Exhibitions 4.7 Acquisition costs on Advanstar 0.6 Acquisition costs on other business combinations 2.0 0.6 Changes in estimates of contingent consideration 0.4 0.2 Exceptional items relating to acquisitions 18.4 10.1 Gain on disposal of investment 2.2 Gain on disposal of associate Note 6.3 9.0 Gain on joint venture previously impaired Note 4.4 2.1 Loss on disposal of Ecobuild Note 6.3 35.1 Gain on disposal non-core businesses Note 6.3 9.2 Exceptional items relating to disposal of investments 14.7 2.1 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets Note 4.1 and Note 4.2 3.4 1.9 Impairment of joint ventures and associates Note 4.4 4.2 Impairment charge 3.4 6.1 Total charged to continuing operating profit 36.5 14.1 Acquisition costs Total acquisition costs of 6.7m have been expensed as exceptional items and relate mainly to due diligence and professional fees paid to various advisors.

The final costs are expected to be approximately $33m.
Business Journals Inc BJI integration costs The costs associated with the integration of BJI are estimated to be $10m in total.

Costs will continue into 2017 to complete the integration.
Exceptional items relating to disposal of investments The Group received 2.1m from the sale of Janus SAS, a French business which the Group exited five years ago, retaining a 9.5% investment.
The gain on disposal of 2.2m has been reported as exceptional income as the investment value and associate vendor loan note were impaired in 2013.
The gain on disposal of associates and gain on disposal of non-core businesses includes 9.0m in relation to the disposal of Light Reading and 9.2m in relation to the electronics media portfolio, respectively.

3.6 Tax This note details the accounting policies applied for tax, the current and deferred tax charges or credits in the year, a reconciliation of total tax expense to the accounting profit and the movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Accounting policy Current tax for the current and prior periods is recognised, to the extent unpaid, as a liability at the amount expected to be paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax liabilities are measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
However, deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences arising from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Current tax expense and deferred tax expense are recognised in the income statement except to the extent they arise from a transaction or event recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Any such tax expense is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity respectively.
The Group is a multi-national group with tax liabilities arising in many geographical locations.
This inherently leads to complexity in the Groups tax structure.
Therefore the calculation of the Groups current tax liabilities and tax expense necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve.
The tax liabilities recognised in the financial statements are measured at the Directors estimate of tax that may become payable.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items.
As a result, there can be substantial differences between the tax charge in the income statement and tax payments.
The final resolution of certain of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period identified.

These have been recognised because the Group expects to generate taxable profits in the future against which these will be used.
The Group has the following unused tax losses for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised: 321.8m 2015: 297.8m in UK subsidiaries which are available to offset against future UK corporate tax liabilities: 189.2m 2015: 201.6m in US subsidiaries which are available to offset against future US federal tax liabilities.
Of these 173.0m expire between 2019 and 2036 2015: 192.7m between 2019 and 2035 : 249.7m 2015: 254.5m of UK capital losses which are only available for offset against future capital gains: 7.2bn 2015: 6.2bn that have arisen in Luxembourg holding companies as a result of revaluations of those companies investments for local GAAP purposes: and 7.4m 2015: 4.0m in respect of companies in other countries.
No deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of any of these amounts as it is uncertain that these losses will be utilised.
In addition the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets in relation to other deductible temporary differences of 20.7m 13.6m in relation to the UK, nil in relation to the US, and 7.1m in relation to other countries 2015: 19.0m 7.1m, 10.1m and 1.8m respectively.
No deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect these assets as it is uncertain that they will be utilised.
130 Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements 3.6 Tax continued At 31 December 2016, deferred tax liabilities of 3.9m 2015: 1.1m have been recognised for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the Groups subsidiaries.
No other deferred tax liabilities have been recognised as the Group has determined that profits of subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised amount in aggregate to 5.0bn 2015: 4.7bn.
3.7 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent entity by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Adjusted basic earnings per share excludes amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, movements on deferred tax balances recognised as a consequence of acquisition of intangibles, exceptional items and net financing expense adjustments detailed in Note 5.4.
The weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of earnings per share reflects the share consolidation on 27 June 2016 of eight for every nine shares owned as detailed in Note 5.8.
In accordance with IAS 33, the prior period weighted average number of shares has not been restated as the share consolidation was coupled with the payment of the special dividend Note 5.8, which had the overall effect of a share repurchase at fair value.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent entity by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The impact of dilutive securities in 2016 would be to increase weighted average shares by 4.3 million shares 2015: 3.0 million shares.
The weighted average number of shares excludes ordinary shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan the ESOP.
Continuing operations Weighted Weighted average no.
