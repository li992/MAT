No changes have been made to asset lives during the year.
Annual report and financial statements 2015 16 73 3 Operating assets continued 3.3 Property, plant and equipment continued As in previous years, fully depreciated assets have been retained in the Groups fixed asset register and included in the table above.
In order to provide greater understanding of the Groups annual depreciation charge, these assets have been removed from both cost and accumulated depreciation.
Included within the above are leasehold land and buildings held under finance lease with a cost of 308m 2015: 308m and accumulated depreciation of 94m 2015: 92m.
The cost of financing property developments prior to their opening date has been included in the cost of the asset.
The cumulative amount of interest capitalised in the total cost above amounts to 197m 2015: 197m.
Impairment The Group considers that each store is a separate cash generating unit CGU and therefore considers every store for an indication of impairment annually.
The Group calculates each stores recoverable amount and compares this amount to its book value.
The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal.
If the recoverable amount is less than the book value, an impairment charge is recognised based on the following methodology: Value in use is calculated by projecting individual store pre-tax cash flows over the remaining useful life of the store, based on forecasting assumptions.
The methodology used for calculating future cash flows is to: use the actual cash flows for each store in the current year: allocate a proportion of the Groups central costs to each store on an appropriate basis: project each stores cash flows over the next five years by applying forecast sales and cost growth assumptions: project cash flows beyond year five for the remaining useful life of each store by applying a long term growth rate: and discount the cash flows using a pre-tax rate of 9.0% 2015: 9.0%.
The discount rate takes into account the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Fair value less costs of disposal is estimated by the Directors based on their knowledge of individual stores and the markets they serve and likely demand from grocers or other retailers.
The Directors also obtain valuations by store prepared by independent valuers and consider these in carrying out their estimate of fair value less cost of disposal for the purposes of testing for impairment.
In determining their valuation, the independent valuers assume an expected rent and yield for each store based on the quality of the asset, local catchment and the store being occupied by a supermarket tenant with a similar covenant to Morrisons.
In order to reflect specific local market conditions, in particular the continued low demand from major grocery retailers for supermarket space, the Directors consider it appropriate for the purpose of testing for impairment to revise downwards the rent and yield assumptions in the independent valuation to reflect the following factors on a store by store basis: Whether a major grocery operator might buy the store, taking into consideration whether they are already located near the store, and whether the store size is appropriate for their business model, and then if not: Assessing whether a smaller store operator might buy the store, in which case the value has been updated to reflect the Directors assessment of the yield which would be achievable if such an operator acquired the store, and then if not: Assessing whether a non-food operator might buy the store, in which case the value has been updated to reflect the Directors assessment of the yield which would be achievable if such an operator acquired the store.
Having applied the above methodology and assumptions, the Group has recognised an impairment charge of nil 2015: 1,116m, tangible assets: 1,113m and intangible assets: 3m during the year.
At 31 January 2016, the key assumption to which the value-in-use calculation is most sensitive to is the discount rate.
Specific sensitivity analysis with regard to this assumption shows that an increase of 1% in the discount rate would result in an additional impairment charge of 140m.
Based on the methodology above, the Group considers the carrying value appropriate.
