Financials and other information Notes to the accounts 1 Segmental analysis The Directors review information on a regular basis that is analysed by geography.
In accordance with IFRS 8, the segmental information provided below uses this geographic analysis of results as it is the most closely aligned with IFRS reporting requirements.
The Group only operates in one service line, being that of an investment holding company.
Therefore, no segmental analysis by service line has been produced.
The Group is an investment holding company and does not consider itself to have any customers.
The Group generated 37% 2015: 55% of its investment income in the period from investments held in the UK and Ireland and 63% 2015: 45% of investment income from investments held in continental Europe.
During the year, the Group generated income from its investments in Elenia of 17.2 million 2015: 18.1 million, Oystercatcher of 14.3 million 2015: 4.3 million, AWG of 8.5 million 2015: 8.0 million and Eversholt Rail of 0.7 million 2015: 15.6 million which represents 29% 2015: 31%, 24% 2015: 7%, 14% 2015: 14% and 1% 2015: 27%, respectively of the total investment income.
There was no other income entitlement during the year or in the comparative year that represented more than 10% of portfolio income.
Given the nature of the Groups operations, the Group is not considered to be exposed to any operational seasonality or cyclicality that would impact the financial results of the Group during the period or the financial position of the Group at 31 March 2016.

7 Investments at fair value through profit or loss and financial instruments All financial instruments for which fair value is recognised or disclosed are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level Fair value input description Financial instruments Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted and in active markets Quoted equity investments Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are Derivative financial instruments held at fair value observable in the market either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices Level 3 Inputs that are not based on observable market data Unquoted investments and unlisted funds For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing the categorisation based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole for each reporting period.
At 31 March 2016, the Group held the following classes of financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
For all other assets and liabilities their carrying value approximates to fair value.
During the year ended 31 March 2016, there were no transfers of financial instruments between levels of the fair value hierarchy 2015: none.
There were no non-recurring fair value measurements.

The holding period of the investments in the portfolio is expected to be greater than one year.
Therefore investments are classified as noncurrent unless there is an agreement to dispose of the investment within one year and all relevant regulatory approvals have been received.
It is not possible to identify with certainty where any investments may be sold within one year.
Unquoted investments The Group invests in private companies which are not quoted on an active market.
These are measured in accordance with the International Private Equity Valuation guidelines with reference to the most appropriate information available at the time of measurement.
Further information regarding the valuation of unquoted investments can be found in the section called Summary of portfolio valuation methodology on page 23.
The Groups policy is to fair value both the equity and debt investments in infrastructure assets together where they will be managed and valued as a single investment, were invested at the same time and cannot be realised separately.
As at 31 March 2016, the fair value of unquoted investments was 1,203.8 million 2015: 1,205.7 million.
Individual portfolio asset valuations are shown within the Portfolio summary on page 19.
The majority of the assets held within Level 3 are valued on a discounted cash flow basis, hence, the valuations are sensitive to the discount rate assumed in the valuation of each asset.
Further details on the methodology applied to the valuation of each investment can be found on page 23.
Other significant unobservable inputs include the long-term inflation rate assumption and interest rates assumption used to project the future cash flows.
A discussion of discount rates applied can be found on page 23.
Increasing the discount rate used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would reduce the value of the portfolio by 124.7 million 2015: 84.2 million.
Decreasing the discount rate used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would increase the value of the portfolio by 151.1 million 2015: 101.6 million.
The majority of assets held within Level 3 have revenues that are linked, partially linked or in some way correlated to inflation.
The long-term inflation rate assumptions for the country of domicile of the investments in the portfolio range from 5.0% India 2015: 5.0% to 2.0% Finland 2015: 2.0% but with the majority at 2.5% UK 2015: 2.5%.
Changing the inflation rate assumption may result in consequential changes to other assumptions used in the valuation of each asset.
The impact of increasing the inflation rate assumption by 1% for the next two years would increase the value of the portfolio by 29.1 million 2015: 17.0 million.
Decreasing the inflation rate assumption used in the valuation ofeach asset by 1% for the next two years would decrease the value of the portfolio by 28.2 million 2015: 16.4 million.
The valuations are sensitive to changes to interest rates, which may result from: i unhedged existing borrowings within portfolio companies: ii interest rates on uncommitted future borrowings assumed within the asset valuations: and iii cash deposits held by portfolio companies.
These comprise a wide range of interest rates from short-term deposit rates to longer-term borrowing rates across a broad range of debt products.
Increasing the cost of borrowing assumption for unhedged borrowings and any future uncommitted borrowing and the cash deposit rates used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would reduce the value of the portfolio by 90.0 million 2015: 56.2 million.
Decreasing the interest rate assumption used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would increase the value of the portfolio by 86.8 million 2015: 52.7 million.
This calculation does not take account of any offsetting variances which may be expected to prevail if interest rates changed, the most significant impact would be in the portfolio assets with regulated returns where the future allowed return may also be influenced bythe interest rate.
84 3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Financials and other information 7 Investments at fair value through profit or loss and financial instruments continued Unlisted funds The Company invests in one externally managed fund, The Dalmore Capital Fund, which is not quoted in an active market.
The Company considered the valuation techniques and inputs used in valuing this fund to ensure they are reasonable and appropriate and therefore the net asset value NAV of this fund may be used as an input into measuring its fair value.
In measuring this fair value, the NAV of the fund is adjusted, as necessary, to reflect restrictions on redemptions, future commitments, illiquid nature of the investments and other specific factors of the fund and fund manager.
The Company classifies the fair value of this investment as Level 3.
As at 31 March 2016, the fair value of unlisted funds was 18.3 million 2015: 17.4 million.
There are no adjustments currently made to the NAV of the fund 2015: none.
A 10% adjustment in the NAV of the fund would result in a 1.8 million 2015: 1.7 million change in the valuation.
Intermediate holding companies The Company invests in a number of intermediate holding companies that are used to hold the unquoted investments, valued as referred to above.
All other assets and liabilities of the intermediate holding companies are held either at fair value or a reasonable approximation to fair value.
The fair value of these intermediate holding companies therefore approximates to their NAV and the Company classifies the fair value as Level 3.
As at 31 March 2016, the fair value of the other assets and liabilities within these intermediate holding companies was 6.7 million 2015: 8.4 million.
Over-the-counter derivatives The Company uses over-the-counter foreign currency derivatives to hedge foreign currency movements on portfolio assets.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
The valuation technique incorporates various inputs including foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves, and uses present value calculations.
For these financial instruments, significant inputs into models are market observable and are included within Level 2.
Valuation process for Level 3 valuations Valuations are the responsibility of the Board of Directors of the Company.
The valuation of unquoted investments, debt, unlisted funds and derivative investments held by the Group is performed on a half-yearly basis by the valuation team of the Investment Adviser and reviewed by the Investment Committee of the Investment Adviser.
The valuations are also subject to quality assurance procedures performed within the valuation team.
The valuation team verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to relevant documents and market information.
On a half-yearly basis, the Investment Committee presents the valuations to the Board.
This includes a discussion of the major assumptions used in the valuations, with an emphasis on the more significant investments and investments with significant fair value changes.
The Investment Committee considers the appropriateness of the valuation methods and inputs, and may request that alternative valuation methods are applied to support the valuation arising from the method chosen.
Any changes in valuation methods are discussed and agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee before being approved by the Board.

9 Financial risk management A full review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Risk report on page 32.
This Note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Principal risks and mitigation section where applicable, and providing further quantitative data on specific financial risks.
Each investment made by the Group is subject to a full risk assessment through a standardised investment approval process.
The Boards Investment Committee and the Investment Advisers investment process are part of the overall risk management framework of the Group.
The funding objective of the Group is that each category of investment ought to be broadly matched with liabilities and shareholders funds according to the risk and maturity characteristics of the assets, and that funding needs are to be met ahead of planned investment.
3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2016 85 Financials and other information Notes to the accounts Continued 9 Financial risk management continued Capital structure The Group has a continuing commitment to capital efficiency.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash held on deposit, borrowing facilities and shareholders equity.
The Companys Articles require its outstanding borrowings, including any financial guarantees to support subsequent obligations, to be limited to 50% of the gross assets of the Group.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed in Note 11 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the statement of changes in equity.
Capital is managed so as to maximise the return to shareholders, while maintaining a strong capital base that ensures that the Group can operate effectively in the marketplace and sustain future development of the business.
The Board is responsible for regularly monitoring capital requirements to ensure that the Company is maintaining sufficient capital to meet its future investment needs.
The Company is regulated under the provisions of the Collective Investment Funds Jersey Law 1988 as a closed-ended collective investment fund and is not required as a result of such regulation to maintain a minimum level of capital.
Capital is allocated for investment in utilities, transportation, primary PPP projects and low-risk energy projects across the UK, continental Europe and Asia.
As set out in the Groups investment policy, the maximum exposure to any one investment is currently 25% of gross assets including cash holdings at the time of investment.
Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on its unquoted investments, cash, deposits, derivative contracts and receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk as a result of counterparty default equates to the current carrying value of these financial assets.
Throughout the year and the prior year, the Groups cash and deposits were held with a variety of counterparties, principally in AAA rated money market funds, as well as in short-term bank deposits with a minimum of a single Acredit rating.
The counterparties selected for the derivative financial instruments were all banks with a minimum of a single Acredit rating.
The credit quality of unquoted investments, which are held at fair value and include debt and equity elements, is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
The credit risk relating to these assets is based on their enterprise value and is reflected through fair value movements.
The credit quality of the assets is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
The performance of underlying investments is monitored by the Board to assess future recoverability.
For those assets and income entitlements that are not past due, it is believed that the risk of default is small and capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the investment.
If the portfolio company has failed and there is no expectation to recover any residual value from the investment, the Groups policy is to record a fair value adjustment for the full amount of the loan.
Fair value adjustments are made when the net present value of the future cash flows predicted to arise from the asset, discounted using the effective interest rate method, implies non-recovery of all or part of the Groups investment.
In these cases a fair value adjustment is recorded equal to the valuation shortfall.
As at 31 March 2016, the Group had no investments subject to impairment 2015: nil.
No other assets held by the Group were considered to be impaired.
The Company had no loans or receivables or debt investments considered past due 2015: nil.
The Company actively manages counterparty risk.
Counterparty limits are set and closely monitored by the Board and a regular review of counterparties is undertaken by the Investment Adviser and the Board.
As at 31 March 2016, the Group did not consider itself to have a significant exposure to any one counterparty and held deposits and derivative contracts with a number of different counterparties to reduce counterparty risk.
Due to the size and nature of the investment portfolio there is concentration risk due to the size of the investments.
This risk is managed by diversifying the portfolio by sector and geography.
The risk exposure at this year end is considered to be representative of the year as a whole.
Liquidity risk Further information on how liquidity risk is managed is provided in the Principal risks and mitigation section.
The table below analyses the maturity of the Groups contractual liabilities.

All derivatives are settled net and therefore the liability shown is the net cash flow expected to be paid on settlement.
The financial commitment relates to the Groups commitments to the 3i India Infrastructure Fund, Mersey Gateway Bridge, Ayrshire College, A9, A12, RIVM, La Sant projects and the new investment in the Condorcet PPP project.
During the year, the Group invested in Oiltanking Terneuzen B. V and Oiltanking Ghent N. V and, as a result, the financial commitment of 107.0 million 77.6 million was extinguished.
In order to manage the contractual liquidity risk the Group is not dependent on the cash flows from financial assets to manage contractual liquidity risk as it has free cash and debt facilities in place.
Market risk The valuation of the Groups investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within the portfolio, but the valuation of the portfolio and the carrying value of other items in the financial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and quoted market fluctuations.
The Groups sensitivities to these fluctuations are set out below.
i Interest rate risk Further information on how interest rate risk is managed is provided in the Principal risks and mitigation section.
An increase or decrease of 250 basis points in interest rates over 12 months 2015: 250 basis points would lead to an approximate increase or decrease in net assets and to the net profit of the Group of 1.2 million 2015: 1.8 million.
This exposure relates principally to changes in interest receivable on cash on deposit held at the year end.
The average cash balance of the Group during the year was 141.9 million 2015: 84.9 million and the weighted average interest earned was 0.5% 2015: 0.4%.
In addition, the Group has indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance of portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations as disclosed in Note 7.
This risk is considered a component of market price risk described in section iii.
The Group does not hold any fixed rate debt investments or borrowings and is therefore not exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
ii Currency risk Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided in the Risk report.
The currency denominations of the Groups net assets are shown in the table below.
The sensitivity analysis demonstrates the exposure of the Groups net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

The impact of an equivalent depreciation in sterling against the euro and US dollar exchange rates has the inverse impact on net profit and net assets from that shown above.
There is an indirect exposure to the rupee through the investment in the 3i India Infrastructure Fund which is denominated in US dollars but it is only the direct exposure that is considered here.
iii Market price risk Further information about the management of external market risk and its impact on market price or valuation, which arises principally from unquoted investments, is provided in the Principal risks and mitigation section.
A 10% increase in the fair value of those investments would have the following direct impact on net profit and net assets.
As at 31 March As at 31 March 2016 2015 Investments at Investments at fair value fair value m m Increase in profit 122.9 123.2 Increase in net assets 122.9 123.2 The impact of a 10% decrease in the fair value of those investments would have the inverse impact on net profit and net assets, from that shown above.
The risk exposure at the year end is considered to be representative of this year as a whole.
By the nature of the Groups activities, it has large exposures to individual assets that are susceptible to movements in price.
This risk concentration is managed within the Companys investment strategy as discussed in the Strategic report.
iv Fair values The fair value of the investment portfolio is described in detail in the Portfolio valuation methodology section and in Note 7.
The fair values of the remaining financial assets and liabilities approximate to their carrying values 2015: same.
The sensitivity analysis in respect of the interest rate, currency and market price risks is considered to be representative of the Groups exposure to financial risks throughout the period to which they relate 2015: same.

The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments and consequently allchanges in fair value are taken through profit or loss.
As at 31 March 2016, the notional amount of the forward foreign exchange contracts held by the Company was 810.0 million 2015: 527.6 million.
Interest rate swaps The Company uses interest rate swaps to minimise the effect of fluctuations in interest rates to fix the value of expected future cash payments payable on debt obligations resulting from non-recourse borrowings made by Oystercatcher Luxco 2 S. r. l. an unconsolidated subsidiary of the Company.
The fair value of these swaps is recorded in the balance sheet.
No swaps are designated as hedging instruments and consequently allchanges in fair value are taken through profit or loss.

In addition, the stated capital account was reduced by Court order on 20 December 2007 with an amount of 693.1 million transferred to a new, distributable reserve which has been combined with retained reserves in these accounts.
Therefore as at 31 March 2016, the residual value on the stated capital account was 181.6 million.
On 31 July 2015, the Company paid a special dividend of 149.8 million to shareholders.
In order to maintain comparability of the Companys share price before and after the special dividend, a share consolidation took place.
On 7 July 2015, an Extraordinary General Meeting was held to approve the share consolidation, which was set at a ratio of 9 new ordinary shares for every 10 existing shares.
The share consolidation ratio was based on a share price of 168.8 pence per share, being the share price on the date of posting the EGM circular and the special dividend was therefore equivalent to approximately 10% of the market capitalisation of the Company at that time.
Subsequent to the year end, the Company announced an Open Offer, Placing and Intermediaries Offer with the objective of raising up to 350 million of additional issued capital.
Further details are provided in the Chairmans statement on page 3.

3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2016 91 Financials and other information Notes to the accounts Continued 18 Related parties continued The IAA also provides for an annual performance fee to be payable to 3i plc.
