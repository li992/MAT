The Company has early adopted the amendments to FRS 102: Fair value hierarchy disclosures, issued by the FRC and applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
The Financial Statements have also been prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC, in November 2014.
The Company is exempt from presenting a Cash Flow Statement as a Statement of Changes in Equity is presented and substantially all of the Companys investments are highly liquid and are carried at market value.
a Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of investments and derivative instruments.
A resolution proposing the continuation of the Company as an investment trust will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2017.
The Directors are recommending that shareholders vote in favour of this resolution.
In accordance with this recommendation and given that the Companys assets consist mainly of securities which are readily realisable and that the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue for the foreseeable future, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare the Financial Statements on a going concern basis.
Accordingly the Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that may arise from a reconstruction or liquidation of the Company.
b Segmental reporting The Company is engaged in a single segment business and, therefore, no segmental reporting is provided.
c Presentation of the Income Statement In order to reflect better the activities of an investment company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been prepared alongside the Income Statement.
The net revenue return after taxation for the year is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. d Income Income from equity investments is accounted for on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established, normally the ex dividend date.
UK dividends are accounted for net of any tax credit.
Overseas dividends are accounted for gross of any tax deducted at source.
Amounts are credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Special dividends are treated as a revenue receipt or a capital receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
Derivative instrument income received from dividends on long contracts for difference CFDs are accounted for on the date on which the right to receive or make the payment is established, normally the ex dividend date.
The net amount is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement.

Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2016 43 INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE STRATEGY Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Accounting Policies continued f Functional currency and foreign exchange The Directors, having regard to the Companys share capital, expenses and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined its functional currency to be UK sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are reported in UK sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on translation are recognised in the Income Statement as a revenue or a capital item depending on the nature of the underlying item to which they relate.
g Finance costs Finance costs represent interest paid on long CFDs which are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and dividends paid on short CFDs, which are accounted for on the date on which the obligation to incur the cost is established, normally the ex dividend date.
They are charged in full to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
h Taxation The taxation charge represents the sum of current taxation and deferred taxation.
Current taxation is taxation suffered at source on overseas income less amounts recoverable under taxation treaties.
Taxation is charged or credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement, except where it relates to items of a capital nature, in which case it is charged or credited to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Deferred taxation is the taxation expected to be payable or recoverable on timing differences between taxable profit and the accounting profit and is based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted when the taxation is expected to be payable or recoverable.
It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences and deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible timing differences can be utilised.
i Dividend paid Dividends payable to equity Shareholders are recognised when the Companys obligation to make payment is established.
j Investments The Companys business is investing in financial instruments with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of investments is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss, in accordance with the provisions of both Section 11 and Section 12 of FRS 102.
The fair value of investments is initially taken to be their cost and is subsequently measured as follows: Listed investments are valued at bid prices, or last market prices, depending on the convention of the exchange on which they are listed, or otherwise, at fair value based on published price quotations.
In accordance with the AIC SORP, the Company includes transaction costs, incidental to the purchase or sale of investments, within gains on investments in the capital column of the Income Statement and has disclosed these costs in note 10 below.
k Derivative instruments When appropriate, permitted transactions in derivative instruments are used.
Derivative transactions into which the Company may enter include long and short CFDs.
Derivatives are classified as other financial instruments and are initially accounted and measured at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value as follows: CFDs are valued at the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying shares in the contract.
Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance income, if the circumstances support this, income and expenses derived are included in net income in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance capital, if the circumstances support this, gains and losses derived are included in gains on derivative instruments in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Any positions on such transactions open at the year end are reflected in the Balance Sheet at their fair value within current assets or creditors.
l Amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers These are amounts held in segregated accounts as collateral on behalf of brokers and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
m Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund The Company holds an investment in the Fidelity Liquidity Fund plc, a short term money market fund investing in a diversified range of short term instruments.
44 Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2016 n Cash at bank Cash at bank is subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
o Capital reserve The following are accounted for in the capital reserve: Gains and losses on the disposal of investments and derivative instruments: Changes in the fair value of investments and derivative instruments held at the year end: Foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature: Dividends receivable which are capital in nature: and Costs of repurchasing ordinary shares.
As a result of technical guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in TECH 02 10: Guidance on the determination of realised profits and losses in the context of distributions under the Companies Act 2006, changes in the fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash, without accepting adverse terms at the Balance Sheet date, can be treated as realised.
Capital reserves realised and unrealised are shown in aggregate as capital reserve in the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Balance Sheet.
At the Balance Sheet date the portfolio of the Company consisted of investments listed on a recognised stock exchange and derivative instruments, contracted with counterparties having an adequate credit rating, and the portfolio was considered to be readily convertible to cash.

Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2016 51 INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE STRATEGY Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Financial Instruments Management of risk The Companys investing activities in pursuit of its investment objective involve certain inherent risks.
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the Company.
The Board with the assistance of the Manager, has developed a risk matrix which, as part of the internal control process, identifies the risks that the Company faces.
Principal risks identified are market, performance, discount control, gearing and currency risks.
Other risks identified are tax and regulatory and operational risks, including those relating to third party service providers covering investment management, marketing and business development, company secretarial, fund administration and operations and support functions.
Risks are identified and graded in this process, together with steps taken in mitigation, and are updated and reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Risks identified are shown in the Strategic Report on pages 10 and 11.
This note refers to the identification, measurement and management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments.
The Companys financial instruments may comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies: Derivative instruments which comprise long CFDs: and Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations.
The risks identified arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk which comprises interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and other price risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk, credit risk and derivative instrument risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies are consistent with those followed last year.
Market price risk Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through its share capital and reserves.
In addition, the Company has gearing through the use of long CFDs.
The level of gearing is reviewed by the Board and the Portfolio Manager.
The Company is exposed to a financial risk arising as a result of any increases in interest rates associated with the funding of the long CFDs.
Interest rate risk exposure The values of the Companys financial instruments that are exposed to movements in interest rates are shown below: 2016 2015 000 000 Exposure to financial instruments that bear interest Long CFDs exposure less fair value 39,362 35,107 Exposure to financial instruments that earn interest Amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers 1,382 3 Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund 6,283 8,800 Cash at bank 4,003 4,080 11,668 12,883 Net exposure to financial instruments that bear interest 27,694 22,224 52 Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2016 Foreign currency risk The Companys net return on ordinary activities after taxation and its net assets can be affected by foreign exchange rate movements because the Company has income, assets and liabilities which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys functional currency which is UK sterling.
Three principal areas have been identified where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in exchange rates a ecting the value of investments and derivative instruments: Movements in exchange rates a ecting short term timing di erences: and Movements in exchange rates a ecting income received.
The portfolio management team monitor foreign currency risk but it is not the Companys current policy to hedge against currency risk.
Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2016 53 INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE STRATEGY Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Financial Instruments continued Currency exposure of financial liabilities The Company finances its investment activities through its ordinary share capital and reserves.
The Companys financial liabilities comprise the gearing effect of long CFDs and other payables.
The currency profile of these financial liabilities is shown below: 2016 other creditors total currency 000 000 UK sterling 2,044 2,044 2,044 2,044 2015 other creditors total currency 000 000 Euro 33 UK sterling 1,872 1,872 1,875 1,875 Other price risk Other price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Portfolio Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities and long CFDs which can be sold easily to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
Liquidity risk exposure At 31 December 2016 the undiscounted gross cash outflows of the financial liabilities were all repayable within one year and consisted of derivative instrument liabilities of 577,000 2015: 83,000 and other creditors of 2,044,000 2015: 1,875,000.
Counterparty risk The long CFDs in which the Company invests are not traded on an exchange but instead will be traded between counterparties based on contractual relationships, under the terms outlined in the International Swaps and Derivatives Associations ISDA market standard derivative legal documentation.
As a result the Company is subject to the risk that a counterparty may not perform its obligations under the related contract.
In accordance with the risk management process which the Manager employs, this risk is minimised by only entering into transactions with counterparties which it believes to have an adequate credit rating at the time the transaction is entered into, by ensuring that formal legal agreements covering the terms of the contract are entered into in advance, and through adopting a counterparty risk framework which measures, monitors and manages counterparty risk by the use of internal and external credit agency ratings and evaluates derivative instrument credit risk exposure.
For Over The Counter OTC derivative transactions, collateral is used to reduce the risk of both parties to the contract.
Collateral is managed on a daily basis for all relevant transactions.
At 31 December 2016, 1,382,000 2015: 3,000 was held by the Company in cash, shown as amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers on the Balance Sheet, in a segregated collateral account on behalf of the broker, to reduce the credit risk exposure of the broker.
54 Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2016 Credit risk Financial instruments may be adversely affected if any of the institutions with which money is deposited suffer insolvency or other financial difficulties.
All transactions are carried out with brokers that have been approved by the Manager and are settled on a delivery versus payment basis.
Limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker and are kept under review by the Manager.
Exposure to credit risk arises on unsettled security transactions, derivative instrument contracts and cash at bank.
Derivative instruments risk The risks and risk management processes which result from the use of derivative instruments are included within the other risk categories disclosed in this Note.
Derivative instruments are used by the Portfolio Manager for the following purposes: To gain unfunded long exposure to equity markets, sectors or single stocks.
Unfunded exposure is exposure gained without an initial ow of capital: To position short exposures in the Companys portfolio.
These uncovered exposures bene t from falls in the prices of shares which the Portfolio Manager believes to be over valued.
These positions, therefore, distinguish themselves from other short exposures held for hedging purposes since they are expected to add risk to the portfolio.
The risk and performance contribution of the derivative instruments to the Companys portfolio is overseen by a specialist Derivative Instruments Team which draws on over forty years of experience in derivative risk management.
The team uses portfolio risk assessment tools to advise the Investment Manager on portfolio construction.
RISK SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis Based on the financial instruments held and interest rates at 31 December 2016, an increase of 0.25% in interest rates throughout the year, with all other variables held constant, would have decreased the return on ordinary activities after taxation for the year and decreased the net assets of the Company by 69,000 2015: 56,000.
A decrease of 0.25% in interest rates throughout the year would have had an equal but opposite effect.
