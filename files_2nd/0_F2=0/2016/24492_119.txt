The goodwill relates to the Groups acquisitions of bwin, Betboo, CasinoClub and Sportingbet.
The carrying values of the assets were compared with the recoverable amounts, the recoverable amount was estimated based upon a value in use calculation, based upon management forecasts for the years ending 31 December 2017 and up to 31 December 2021.
The assumptions detailed below have been determined based on past experience in this market which the Groups management believes is the best available input for forecasting this market.
Goodwill can be broken down into the following: 2016 2015 m m bwin 957.4 Betboo 8.3 8.3 CasinoClub 40.4 40.4 Sportingbet 84.2 84.2 TOTAL GOODWILL 1,090.3 132.9 bwin The allocation of the bwin goodwill includes various CGUs, split along the Groups reporting segment and includes changes to the CGUs presented in the 2016 interim financial statements following a final review by management of the assumptions underlying the determination and allocation of goodwill and intangibles.
The carrying value of these, together with the assumptions used within those individual CGUs are shown in the tables below.
The discount rates used have been considered based on the risks involved in each of the underlying business units and terminal growth rates reect the expected growth in underlying EBITDA expected from these units.
These CGUs have been considered for impairment and sensitivities have been calculated around the terminal growth rates and discount factors used together with specic scenarios including the loss of revenue where those revenues might be considered to be at risk.
No indicators of impairment have arisen as a result as the impact of all sensitivities were judged to be within tolerable levels.
