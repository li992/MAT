SECTION 4: FINANCING AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE This section gives further information regarding the Groups capital structure equity and debt financing and cash generated from operations during the year.
4.1 Reconciliation of net debt Net debt is calculated by taking our borrowings note 4.3 and subtracting cash and cash equivalents note 4.2.
The table below reconciles net debt in terms of changes in these balances across the year.
Years ended 31 December 2016 2015 m m Net debt at 1 January 186.6 98.6 Increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 86.7 49.0 Decrease increase in short-term investments 40.1 Increase in borrowings 1.5 0.8 Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 7.9 1.9 Net debt at 31 December 93.5 186.6 The increase in borrowings reflects the accrual of interest on the Groups term loans see note 4.3.
4.2 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash held in current and other deposit accounts that are accessible on demand.
It is our policy to invest available cash on hand in short-term, low risk bank or building society deposits.
As at 31 December 2016 2015 m m Cash and cash equivalents 228.4 133.8 4.3 Borrowings Our financing structure includes 325 million of term loans, comprised of a private placement of 100 million with various funds managed by M&G Investments, a 75 million amortising loan facility with Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury under the Infrastructure UK Guarantee Scheme, a 50 million amortising term loan with Green Investment Bank and a 100 million amortising term loan facility with M&G UK Companies Financing Fund.
The loans have varying maturity profiles ranging from 2017 to 2025.
All of the term loans were fully drawn down at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015.
In addition, the Group has access to a 400 million revolving credit facility RCF.
The facility matures in December 2019 and has a margin of 175 basis points over LIBOR.
At 31 December 2016 this facility had been utilised to draw down letters of credit with a total value of 57.9 million 2015: 37.9 million see note 7.5.
The Group also has a commodity trading facility, which allows us to transact prescribed volumes of commodity trades without the requirement to post collateral.
Accounting policy The Group measures all debt instruments whether financial assets or financial liabilities initially at fair value, which equates to the principal value of the consideration paid or received.
Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Transaction costs any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised through the income statement over the life of the instrument.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down.
Where this is the case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.
Analysis of borrowings Borrowings at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 consisted principally of amounts drawn down against bank loans.
