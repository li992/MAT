What we have audited The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts the Annual Report, comprise: the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2016: the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended: the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended: the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended: the accounting policies: and the notes to the financial statements, which include other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements.
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and applicable law.
Our audit approach Overview Overall group materiality: 70 million 2015: 70 million which represents 4.5% 2015: 4.8% of Operating profit before tax.
Based on the outputs of our risk assessment, along with our understanding of the L&G structure, Materiality we performed full scope audits of components which, using our professional judgement, we considered significant within the following segments: Legal & General Retirement LGR, Legal & General Investment Management LGIM, Legal & General Insurance LGI, Savings and General Insurance GI.
Audit scope In addition, specific audit procedures on investments and investment returns were performed within the Legal & General Capital LGC segment.
Our risk assessment analysis identified the following as areas of focus: Areas of Valuation of non-participating insurance contract liabilities Retirement: focus Valuation of non-participating insurance contract liabilities Protection: Valuation of complex investments collateralised debt obligations CDOs, new asset classes and new transactions in mark to model investments.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland ISAs UK & Ireland.
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified as areas of focus in the table on the following page.
We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

We focused on this area because the provision for the settlement of future claims for retirement products is significant in size and its estimation involves complex and subjective judgements about future events, both internal and external to the business, for which small changes in assumptions can materially impact the valuation of these liabilities.
Key assumption areas are: Valuation interest rate the discount rate derived from the yield on the assets backing the annuity liabilities used in calculating the present value of annuity and benefit payments.
The discount rate also includes an explicit allowance for future credit default and reinvestment risk on the asset portfolio: and Longevity how long the policyholders receiving annuity payments are expected to live and how that might change over time.
Our audit effort covered these key assumptions.
We focused a greater amount of effort where either of the assumptions changed in the period or where we considered, based on the annual analysis of longevity and credit default, that the assumptions or methodology needed to be reconsidered.
Valuation interest rate The work we performed to address the risks over determination of the valuation The valuation interest rate is the asset yieldinterest rate included the following procedures: based rate that is used to discount the liability We developed an understanding of the degree of rigour, challenge and oversight cashflows to present value.
The discount rate provided by management and the directors in relation to the setting of the credit also includes an explicit allowance for future default assumptions and the methodology used to model the cash flows.

Credit default assumptions are inappropriate We assessed the appropriateness of the credit default allowance in light of changing market conditions and other information available.
We did this by comparing assumptions used by management with market observable data and our experience of market practices: and On a sample basis, we tested the credit ratings used to estimate the default allowance back to independent third party credit rating sources.
Where internally generated ratings were used, we assessed the rating model and the methodology using specialist treasury expertise and tested the inputs by comparing it to third party data.
Based on the work undertaken, we found the valuation interest rate used to be appropriate.

We focused on this area because the non-participating insurance liabilities for protection products in the UK are significant in size and their estimation is inherently judgemental.
The valuation of insurance liabilities for protection is sensitive to: persistency the rate at which policies are retained over time and therefore continue to contribute premium income: and mortality and morbidity the rate at which policyholders die or suffer critical illness.
Persistency assumptions Using our actuarial specialists, we assessed the results of the experience analysis The rate at which policyholders cease protection carried out by the group for the protection business to determine whether it provided products is projected using the groups historical support for the assumptions used.

The groups financial investments enable it to support its insurance liabilities and meet regulatory capital requirements, as well as providing returns on shareholder assets the assets available for distribution to shareholders after taking account of policyholder liabilities, including associated guarantees, options and bonuses.
Most of the groups financial investments are valued by reference to prices on active markets.
However, some are priced by reference to market data and or valuation models.
They vary in complexity depending on the nature of the investments.
Investments that are complex to value and require the use of significant judgement include: CDOs: new asset classes: and new transactions in mark to model investments.
Valuation of complex investments including For the valuation of complex investments, we assessed both the methodology and CDOs, new asset classes and new transactions assumptions used by management in the calculation of the year end values as well in mark to model investments as testing the governance controls that the group has in place to monitor these We focused on the valuation of CDOs, new asset processes.

104 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates.
Using the outputs of a risk assessment, along with our understanding of the group, we scoped our audit based on the significance of the results and financial position of individual markets relative to the group result and financial position.
In doing so, we considered qualitative factors and ensured that we obtained sufficient coverage across all financial statement line items in the consolidated financial statements.
We determined the type of work that needed to be performed for each component by us as the group engagement team, component audit teams within PwC UK and from other PwC network firms under our instructions.
The group reports in six reportable segments: LGR, LGIM, LGC, LGI, Savings and GI.
Based on the outputs of our risk assessment, along with our understanding of the L&G structure, we performed full scope audits of components which, using our professional judgement, we considered significant within the following segments: LGR, LGIM, LGI, Savings and GI.
We performed specific audit procedures on the significant investment and investment return balances within the LGC segment.
Where work was performed by auditors of the components, we determined the level of involvement we needed as the group audit team to have in the audit work at those components to be able to conclude whether sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.
The group audit team kept in regular communication with component audit teams through on-site visits, regular phone calls, discussions and written instructions, where appropriate.
Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Overall group materiality 70 million 2015: 70 million.
How we determined it Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole of 70 million which represents 4.5% of Operating profit before tax 2015: 4.8%.
Rationale for benchmark applied In determining materiality, we considered financial metrics which we believed to be relevant, and concluded, consistent with last year that Operating profit before tax was the most relevant benchmark because it reflects the underlying profit of the business.
While this is not an IFRS measure of profit, it is reconciled to IFRS profit before tax in the financial statements and is one of the key metrics used by the group in running its business.
Whilst overall materiality was assessed with reference to Operating profit before tax, we compared our materiality level against other relevant benchmarks, such as total assets, total revenue and IFRS profit before tax in order to ensure the materiality benchmark selected was appropriate for our audit.
Component materiality For each component in our audit scope, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality.
The range of materiality allocated across components was 10million 65million.
Certain components that produce their own audited financial statements were audited to a local statutory audit materiality which was less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 3.5 million 2015: 3.5 million as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors statement, set out on page 233, in relation to going concern.
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Under ISAs UK & Ireland we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the directors statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
As noted in the directors statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The going concern basis presumes that the group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed.
As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the groups ability to continue as a going concern.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Our responsibilities and those of the directors As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs UK & Ireland.
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Boards Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the groups members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the groups circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions.
We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors Report and Corporate Governance Statement, we consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
Other matter We have reported separately on the company financial statements of Legal & General Group Plc for the year ended 31 December 2016 and on the information in the Directors Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Significant accounting policies The group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union, and with those parts of the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The group financial statements also comply with IFRS and interpretations by the IFRS Interpretations Committee as issued by the IASB as adopted by the European Union.
The group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings, available-for-sale financial assets, financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit and loss.
The group has selected accounting policies which state fairly its financial position, financial performance and cash flows for a reporting period.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented.
Accounting policies that relate specifically to a balance or transaction are presented above the relevant numerical disclosure.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed gross in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless a legally enforceable right of offset exists and there is an intention to settle recognised amounts on a net basis.
Income and expenses are not offset in the Consolidated Income Statement unless required or permitted by any accounting standard or IFRIC interpretation, as detailed in the applicable accounting policies of the group.
Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective Certain standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published which are mandatory for the groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 or later periods but which the group has not adopted early.
Details of these are contained within note 12 Financial investments and investment property, note 22 Investment contract liabilities and note 43 Commitments.
Use of estimates The preparation of the financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Income Statement and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates, possibly significantly.
This is particularly relevant for the following disclosures: Financial statement area Significant judgements in applying accounting policy Related notes Valuation of insurance Determination of mortality and longevity assumptions used in the calculation of the insurance contract liabilities.
19 - 22 and investment The assumptions for the rate of future longevity, mortality and morbidity are based on the groups internal contract liabilities experience and judgements about how experience may vary in the future.
This assessment takes into account market benchmarking, internal experience studies and independent industry data.
Determination of valuation interest rates used to discount the liabilities are sensitive to the assumptions made, for example, on credit default of the backing assets.
These assumptions take into account consideration of market experience and historic data internal data.
Note 20 provides a sensitivity analysis including these assumptions.
Valuation of investment Determination of fair value of investment property, and unquoted and illiquid assets involves judgements as 12 and 20 property and unquoted mark to model valuations inherently include assumptions that lead to the existence of a range of plausible illiquid assets valuation for financial assets.
Note 12 provides a range of valuations based on reasonably possible alternative assumptions, and the sensitivities in Note 20 include a sensitivity to property valuation changes.
Defined benefit pension Determination of pension plan assumptions including mortality, discount rates and inflation.
These assumptions 26 plan have been set in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 and include consistent judgements with those in setting the annuity liabilities where possible.
Note 26 includes a sensitivity analysis to alternative assumptions.
Consolidation principles Subsidiary undertakings The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the company and of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are those entities including special purpose entities, mutual funds and unit trusts over which the group directly or indirectly when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee note 45.
Profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the period are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of gaining control.
The interests of parties, other than the group, in investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, are classified as liabilities and appear as Net asset value attributable to unit holders note 12 v in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
114 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Primary statements and performance continued Associates and joint ventures The group has interests in associates and joint ventures note 46 which form part of an investment portfolio held through private equity vehicles, mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities.
In accordance with the choice permitted by IAS 28, Investments in associates, these interests have been classified as fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value within financial investments, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Associates which do not form part of an investment portfolio are initially recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost.
The carrying amount of the associate is increased or decreased to reflect the groups share of the profit or loss after the date of the acquisition.
Product classification The groups products are classified for accounting purposes as either insurance contracts participating and non-participating or investment contracts participating and non-participating.
The basis of accounting for these products is outlined in notes 21 and 22 respectively.
Fiduciary activities Assets associated with fiduciary activities and the income arising from those assets, together with associated commitments to return such assets to customers, are not included in these financial statements.
Where the group acts in a fiduciary capacity, for instance as a trustee or agent, it has no contractual rights over the assets concerned.
Foreign exchange and exchange rates Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions.
The functional currency of the groups foreign operations is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
The assets and liabilities of all of the groups foreign operations are translated into sterling, the groups presentation currency, at the closing rate at the date of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to a separate component of shareholders equity.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when recognised in equity as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges.
The year end exchange rates at 31 December 2016 were 1.24 United States Dollar and 1.17 Euro at 31 December 2015: 1.47 United States Dollar and 1.36 Euro.
The average exchange rates for year ended 31 December 2016 were 1.36 United States Dollar and 1.22 Euro year ended 31 December 2015: 1.53 United States Dollar and 1.38 Euro.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 115 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Primary statements and performance continued 2 Supplementary operating profit information continued i Reconciliation between operating profit and profit from ordinary activities after income tax continued The equity holders' effective tax rate for the year is 20.0% 2015: 19.3%.
This supplementary operating profit information one of the groups key performance indicators provides further analysis of the results reported under IFRS and the group believes it provides shareholders with a better understanding of the underlying performance of the business in the year.
During 2016, the Insurance excluding General Insurance and LGA segments were combined to create the new Legal & General Insurance LGI segment.
General Insurance is now presented as a separate segment.
LGR represents worldwide pension risk transfer business including longevity insurance, individual retirement and lifetime mortgages.
The LGIM segment represents institutional and retail investment management and workplace savings businesses.
LGC represents shareholder assets invested in direct investments, and traded and treasury assets.
LGI represents UK retail protection, group protection and network business, Legal & General Netherlands LGN and protection business written in the USA LGA.
LGI comparatives include Legal & General France LGF, which was sold during 2015.
Savings represents business in platforms, SIPPs and mature savings, including with-profits.
The General Insurance segment comprises short-term protection.
During 2016, changes have been made to the organisational structure.
The advised sales and India businesses have transferred to LGI from Savings, and Investment Discounts On Line Limited the IDOL has been transferred to LGR from LGI.
Comparatives have been amended accordingly.
The impact of this reclassification has been to increase LGR 2015 operating profit by 2m, increase Savings 2015 operating profit by 8m and reduce LGI 2015 operating profit by 10m.
Operating profit measures the pre-tax result excluding the impact of investment volatility, economic assumption changes and exceptional items.
Operating profit therefore reflects longer-term economic assumptions for the groups insurance businesses and shareholder funds, except for LGCs trading businesses which reflects IFRS profit before tax and LGA which excludes unrealised investment returns to align with the liability measurement under US GAAP.
Variances between actual and smoothed investment return assumptions are reported below operating profit.
Exceptional income and expenses which arise outside the normal course of business in the year, such as merger and acquisition, and start-up costs, are also excluded from operating profit.
ii Reconciliation of release from operations to operating profit before tax The table below provides an analysis of the release from operations by each of the groups business segments, together with a reconciliation to operating profit before tax.
Release from operations includes dividends remitted from LGN of 70m 2015: 28m within the LGI UK and Other line and US of 63m 2015: 54m.
2. International and other includes 43m 2015: 34m of restructuring costs 54m before tax 2015: 42m before tax within the group investment projects and expenses line.
This represents Workplace Savings admin only and excludes fund management profits.
The Kingswood office closure costs reflect expenditure in relation to rent and rates, as well as the write-off of previously capitalised expenditure.
116 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Primary statements and performance continued Release from operations for LGR, LGIM, LGI and Savings represents the expected IFRS surplus generated in the year from the in-force non profit annuities, workplace savings, protection and savings businesses using best estimate assumptions.
The LGIM release from operations also includes operating profit after tax from the institutional and retail investment management businesses.
The LGI release from operations also includes dividends remitted from LGN and LGA and operating profit after tax from the remaining LGI businesses.
The Savings release from operations includes the shareholders share of bonuses on with-profits business and operating profit after tax from the remaining Savings businesses.
New business surplus strain for LGR, LGIM, LGI and Savings represents the cost of acquiring new business and setting up prudent reserves in respect of the new business for UK non profit annuities, workplace savings, protection and savings, net of tax.
The new business surplus and release from operations for LGR, LGIM, LGI and Savings exclude any capital held in excess of the prudent reserves from the liability calculation.
Net release from operations for LGR, LGIM, LGI and Savings is defined as release from operations less new business strain.
Release from operations and net release from operations for LGC and General Insurance represents the operating profit net of tax.
The advised sales and India businesses have been transferred to LGI from Savings, and the IDOL business has been transferred to LGR from LGI.
The impact of this reclassification has been to increase LGR 2015 release from operations by 2m, increase Savings 2015 release from operations by 6m and reduce LGI 2015 release from operations by 8m.
See note iii for more detail on experience variances, changes to valuation assumptions and non-cash items.
Release from operations includes dividends remitted from LGF of 1m and LGN of 28m within the LGI UK and Other line and US of 54m.
2. International and other includes 34m of restructuring costs 42m before tax within the group investment projects and expenses line.
L GR includes the IDOL business which was previously reported in LGI, and LGI includes the advised sales and India businesses which were previously reflected in Savings.

T he LGR mortality morbidity experience variance reflects higher than expected annuitant deaths experience over 2016.
LGI mortality morbidity experience variance in 2016 primarily reflects adverse claims experience on the group protection book of business.
The LGI persistency valuation assumption change in 2016 is the result of a review of prudence within the lapse assumption for level and decreasing term assurance products.
The mortality morbidity valuation assumption change in LGR primarily reflects a change in the treatment to historic longevity insurance deals where future fees in excess of prudent estimates of longevity and expense experience are now included as an offset to IFRS reserves.
The 2015 LGR mortality morbidity change to valuation assumptions primarily reflected a change in mortality reserving assumptions in relation to unreported deaths of deferred annuitants.
T he LGI expense valuation assumption change is the result of the reduction in unit costs following recent expense saving actions, together with a review of the prudence within renewal expenses on our protection products.
The reinsurance modelling for our UK protection business was enhanced in 2015.
Recent reinsurance contracts have been written on a risk premium basis as opposed to level premium and the model change ensured that for these treaties, sufficient prudence was being held in later years.
The one-off impact reduced operating profit by 93m in 2015.
This also deferred a higher proportion of release from operations into the later years of these reinsurance contracts.
N et release from operations for LGI and Savings recognises tax relief from prior year acquisition expenses, which are spread evenly over seven years under relevant I-E tax legislation in the period the cash flows actually occur.
In contrast, operating profit typically recognises the value of these future cash flows in the same period as the underlying expense as deferred tax amounts.
The reconciling amounts arising from these items are included in the table above.
Following the removal of new retail protection business from the 'I-E' tax regime, and the removal of commission from new insured savings business under the Retail Distribution Review at the end of 2012, no material amount of deferred tax assets arise on new acquisition expenses and the value of these future cash flows for post-2013 acquisition expenses have been reflected within net release from operations.
The residual prior year acquisition expenses will run off predictably to 2018.
The DAC in Savings represents the amortisation charges offset by new acquisition costs deferred in the year.
The DIL reflects initial fees on insured savings business which relate to the future provision of services and are deferred and amortised over the anticipated period in which these services are provided.

5 Earnings per share Earnings per share is a measure of the portion of the groups profit allocated to each outstanding share.
It is calculated by dividing net income attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding employee scheme treasury shares.
For this purpose, net income is defined as the profit after tax, attributable to equity holders of the company, derived from continuing operations.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, excluding employee scheme treasury shares, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share options granted to employees.
Potential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease net earnings per share.
Adjusted earnings per share are also presented which exclude the impact of disposals of subsidiaries and joint ventures and the classification of subsidiaries as held for sale on profit after tax.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 121 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management 7 Principal products A significant part of the groups business involves the acceptance and management of risk.
A description of the principal products offered by the groups segments is outlined below.
The group seeks to manage its exposure to risk through control techniques which ensure that the residual exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the board.
The groups risk appetite framework and the methods used to monitor risk exposures can be found on pages 40 to 45.
Details of the risks associated with the groups principal products and the control techniques used to manage these risks can be found in notes 8 and 18.
Legal & General Retirement LGR Annuity contracts Annuity products provide guaranteed income for a specified time, usually the life of the policyholder, in exchange for a lump sum capital payment.
No surrender value is available under any of these products.
Immediate and deferred annuity contracts are offered.
Immediate annuities provide a regular income stream to the policyholder, purchased with a lump sum investment, where the income stream starts immediately after the purchase.
The income stream from a deferred annuity is delayed until a specified future date.
Bulk annuities are also offered, where the group accepts the assets and liabilities of a company pension scheme or a life fund, predominantly to UK clients, but also for US, Dutch and Irish clients.
A small portfolio of immediate annuities has been written as participating business.
Some nonparticipating deferred annuities sold by the group contain guaranteed cash options, predominantly minimum factors for commuting part of the annuity income into cash at the date of vesting.
The value of such guaranteed options are currently immaterial.
There is a block of immediate and deferred annuities within the UK non profit business with benefits linked to changes in the RPI or for a minority the CPI, but with contractual maximum or minimum increases.
In particular, most of these annuities have a provision that the annuity will not reduce if RPI, or for a minority CPI, becomes negative.
The total of such annuities in payment at 31 December 2016 was 610m 2015: 572m.
Thus, 1% negative inflation, which was reversed in the following year, would result in a guarantee cost of approximately 6m 2015: 6m.
Negative inflation sustained over a longer period would give rise to significantly greater guarantee costs.
Some of these guarantee costs have been partially matched through the purchase of negative inflation hedges and limited price indexation swaps.
The group also offers products for individuals that provide a guaranteed level of income over a chosen fixed period of time, in exchange for an initial lump sum payment from the policyholder.
The products can provide a fixed lump sum at maturity and or options to surrender on non-guaranteed terms.
The group has written some deferred annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum pensions.
These options expose the group to interest rate and longevity risk as the cost would be expected to increase with decreasing interest rates and improved longevity.
The market consistent value of these guarantees carried in the balance sheet is 250m 2015: 176m.
Longevity insurance contracts The group also provides longevity insurance products for company pension schemes, under which regular payments are made to the scheme reflecting their actual longevity experience, while the scheme makes an agreed set of regular payments in return.
Some policies contain a guaranteed surrender value which is currently immaterial.
Lifetime mortgages Lifetime mortgages are a form of equity release mortgage that provide non-commercial borrowers with a loan secured against their main residence, without the need for regular repayments.
They are regulated retail mortgages offered only to borrowers over the age of 60 through specialist intermediaries.
Interest accrues over the term of the loan and is repayable at the time the principal becomes due.
All Lifetime mortgages provide a no negative equity guarantee, which means that if the loan is repaid from the sale of the property and the net sale proceeds are lower than the balance of the loan, the group will accept the net sale proceeds as full settlement.
Legal & General Investment Management LGIM LGIM offers both active and passive management on either a pooled or segregated basis.
Assets are managed on behalf of pension funds, institutional clients, sovereign wealth clients, retail funds and subsidiary companies within the group.
The core products are set out below.
Index fund management LGIM provides a diversified range of pooled index funds, providing a wide choice and the ability to pursue specific benchmarks efficiently.
In addition, segregated solutions are offered to institutional clients providing large scale customisation against established market capitalisation weighted and alternative indices.
Active fixed income and liquidity management A range of pooled and segregated active fixed income funds.
The LGIM liquidity funds offer institutional investors a solution for their cash management requirements across a range of core currencies.
The liquidity funds aim to deliver competitive returns with a high level of diversification, whilst focusing on capital preservation through portfolios of high quality, liquid assets.
122 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued Solutions and Liability Driven Investment LDI A range of pooled and bespoke solutions to help fide-risk defined benefit pension schemes.
These solutions will usually combine active or passive underlying portfolios with derivative overlays designed to meet clients specific requirements.
Solutions also includes a range of pooled multi-asset funds for retail and institutional clients, built using LGIMs expertise in asset allocation which is informed by an in-house research capability.
The underlying asset classes may be managed on an active or passive basis within LGIM.
An allocation strategy service is also offered to institutional clients, which may also allocate some of the portfolio to managers other than LGIM.
Active equity An active equity management business comprising focused teams managing stock selection across different regions.
Real assets A range of pooled or segregated real estate funds for both UK and overseas investors, offered via a mixture of pooled funds, specialist funds and partnerships.
The business is based around in-house sector specialists with a dedicated research team.
Legal & General Capital LGC Investment strategy and implementation LGC manages shareholder assets which are not directly required to meet contractual obligations to policyholders.
LGCs investments fall into two distinct categories: direct investments and traded assets.
The value of, and income from, both categories is sensitive to conditions within investment markets and the broader economy.
Potential volatility in returns are managed using a range of techniques, including performance benchmarks, foreign exchange and interest rate hedging, and exposure concentration limits by asset type, sector and geographic region.
Direct investments and structuring Direct investments are an integral part of the wider group strategy.
Direct investments are typically illiquid investments entered into through acquisition, joint venture with strategic partners or by creating new companies directly.
LGC seeks to create revenue-generating direct investments in sectors where there are significant funding shortfalls, namely housing, infrastructure including urban regeneration and clean energy and SME finance.
LGC employs capital and sector expertise to target attractive risk-adjusted returns.
Legal & General Insurance LGI LGI business comprises UK retail and group protection, US protection and universal life business, and the Netherlands business LGN.
UK protection business retail and group The group offers protection products which provide mortality or morbidity benefits.
They may include health, disability, critical illness and accident benefits: these additional benefits are commonly provided as supplements to main life policies but can also be sold separately.
The benefit amounts would usually be specified in the policy terms.
Some sickness benefits cover the policyholders mortgage repayments and are linked to the prevailing mortgage interest rates.
In addition to these benefits, some contracts may guarantee premium rates, provide guaranteed insurability benefits and offer policyholders conversion options.
US protection business Protection consists of individual term assurance, which provides death benefits over the medium to long term.
The contracts have level premiums for an initial period with premiums set annually thereafter.
During the initial period, there is generally an option to convert the contract to a universal life contract.
After the initial period, the premium rates are not guaranteed, but cannot exceed the age-related guaranteed premium.
Reinsurance is used within the protection businesses to manage exposure to large claims.
These practices lead to the establishment of reinsurance assets on the groups balance sheet.
Within LGA, reinsurance and securitisation is also used to provide regulatory solvency relief including relief from regulation governing term insurance and universal life reserves.
US universal life Universal life contracts written by LGA provide savings and death benefits over the medium to long term.
The savings element has a guaranteed minimum growth rate.
LGA has exposure to loss in the event that interest rates decrease and it is unable to earn enough on the underlying assets to cover the guaranteed rate.
LGA is also exposed to loss should interest rates increase, as the underlying market value of assets will generally fall without a change in the surrender value.
The reserves for universal life totalled $596m 482m at 31 December 2016 $625m 424m at 31 December 2015.
The guaranteed interest rates associated with those reserves ranged from 1.5% to 6%, with the majority of the policies having guaranteed rates ranging from 3% to 4% 2015: 3% to 4%.
Legal & General Netherlands LGN In addition to protection products, LGN also write savings business, which includes unit linked and index linked savings products, bank based investment accounts and corporate pension products.
Certain savings products include an exposure to interest rate and credit risk, managed through an active asset-liability management programme.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 123 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued 7 Principal products continued Savings A range of contracts are offered in a variety of different forms to meet customers long term savings objectives.
Policyholders may choose to include a number of protection benefits within their savings contracts.
Typically, any guarantees under the contract would only apply on maturity or earlier death.
On certain older contracts there may be provisions guaranteeing surrender benefits.
Savings contracts may or may not guarantee policyholders an investment return.
The contracts fall into three main types: Non-participating savings, pensions and endowment contracts: Participating savings business, comprising endowment contracts and with-profits bonds: and Unit linked savings contracts and collective investment savings products.
For unit linked savings contracts and collective investment savings products, there is a direct link between the investments and the obligations.
The financial risk on these contracts is borne by the policyholders and therefore detailed risk disclosures have not been presented in respect of the associated assets and liabilities.
Unit linked business is written in the Society with-profits fund.
Collective investment business is administered by Legal & General Portfolio Management Services Limited.
Pensions individual and corporate These are long term savings contracts through which policyholders accumulate pension benefits.
Some older contracts contain a basic guaranteed benefit expressed as an amount of pension payable or a guaranteed annuity option.
Other options provided by these contracts include an open market option on maturity, early retirement and late retirement.
The group would generally have discretion over the terms on which the latter types of options are offered.
Endowment policies These contracts provide a lump sum on maturity determined by the addition of annual and final bonuses over the duration of the contract.
In addition, the contracts provide a minimum sum assured death benefit.
With-profits bonds These contracts provide an investment return to the policyholder which is determined by the attribution of regular and final bonuses over the duration of the contract.
In addition, the contracts provide a death benefit, typically of 101% of the value of the units allocated to the policyholder.
Participating contracts The with-profits fund ceased writing new business on 31 January 2015.
Only increases to existing pension policies and new members to existing group Personal Pension Schemes, where allowed for in the policy terms and conditions, have been accepted after that date.
Regular premiums in payment at the date of closure will also continue to be accepted.
Sales of new with-profits bonds were suspended in January 2014 before closing with-profits bonds to increments at the end of December 2014.
Discretionary increases to benefits on participating contracts are allowed in one or both of annual and final bonus form.
These bonuses are determined in accordance with the principles outlined in the Societys Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM for the management of the with-profits fund.
The principles include: The with-profits fund will be managed with the objective of ensuring that its assets are sufficient to meet its liabilities without the need for additional capital: Bonus rates will be smoothed so that some of the short term fluctuations in the value of the investments of the with-profits fund and the business results achieved in the with-profits fund are not immediately reflected in payments under with-profits policies: and Some older participating contracts include a guaranteed minimum rate of roll up of the policyholders fund up to the date of retirement or maturity.
The inherited estate is the excess of assets held within the with-profits fund over and above the amount required to meet liabilities, including those which arise from the regulatory duty to treat customers fairly in settling discretionary benefits.
Following the closure of the with-profits sub fund on 31 January 2015, the Board agreed a run-off plan.
They will consider annually whether part of the inherited estate should be distributed to with-profits policyholders.
In adverse circumstances this may result in a deduction from investment returns in order to increase the value of the inherited estate.
The amount and timing of any distribution from or deduction to increase the inherited estate shall be determined by the Board.
Following this approach, the Board has agreed that there should be no distribution of the estate and no charge for options and guarantees as part of the 2016 bonus declaration.
124 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued The distribution of surplus to shareholders depends upon the bonuses declared for the year.
Typically, bonus rates are set having regard to investment returns, although the group has some discretion setting rates and would normally smooth bonuses over time.
The volatility of investment returns could impact the funds capital position and its ability to pay bonuses.
If future investment conditions were less favourable than anticipated, the lower bonus levels resulting would also reduce future distributions to shareholders.
The unallocated divisible surplus in the fund would normally be expected to absorb the impact of these investment risks.
Only in extreme scenarios, where shareholders were required to provide support to the with-profits fund to meet its liabilities, would these risks affect equity.
As part of the 2007 with-profit fund restructure, the 1996 sub-fund 321m was merged into the Shareholder Retained Capital SRC.
As a result, Societys Board of Directors undertook to initially maintain 500m of assets within Society to support the with-profits business.
The amount of the commitment reduced to 50m at the end of 2016 and will then gradually reduce to zero by the end of 2017.
General Insurance GI General Insurance business comprises Household and Accident, Sickness and Unemployment ASU, and pet products.
Household These contracts provide cover in respect of policyholders homes, investment properties, contents, personal belongings and incidental liabilities which they may incur as a property owner, occupier and individual.
Exposure is normally limited to the rebuilding cost of the home, the replacement cost of belongings and a policy limit in respect of liability claims.
In addition, there is an additional cover option for Family Legal Protection FLP to cover costs of pursuing certain UK legal proceedings arising from, for example: death personal injury, buying hiring goods or services, infringement of property legal rights and breach of employment contracts.
Accident, Sickness and Unemployment ASU These contracts provide cover in respect of continuing payment liabilities incurred by customers when they are unable to work as a result of accident, sickness or unemployment.
They protect predominantly mortgage payments.
Exposure is limited to the monthly payment level selected by the customer sufficient to cover the payment and associated costs, up to the duration limit specified in the policy, usually 12 months.
Pet insurance Legal & General Pet Insurance is arranged and administered by Ultimate Pet Partners Limited and underwritten by Legal & General Insurance Limited.
The policies aim to protect dogs and cats against unexpected accidents and illnesses.
These are then split into three categories accident only, 12 month or lifetime cover.
In addition, there are portfolios of Motor Insurance and Domestic Mortgage Indemnity Insurance DMI in run-off.
Since 1993, the DMI contract has included a maximum period of cover of ten years, and a cap on the maximum claim.
For business accepted prior to 1993, cover is unlimited and lasts until the insured property is remortgaged or redeemed: the group expects 2017 will be the last year for which the group is on risk as the mortgages insured will have been fully paid off by then.
The group ceased underwriting motor business in 2007.
Only three claims currently remain outstanding.
A small amount of revenue is generated through a distribution only model for Travel and Motor products.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 125 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued 8 Asset risk The group is exposed to the following categories of risk as a consequence of offering the principal products outlined in note 7.
Market risk Exposure to loss as a direct or indirect result of fluctuations in the value of, or income from, specific assets.
Credit risk Exposure to loss if another party fails to perform its financial obligations to the group.
Liquidity risk The risk that the group, though solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources available to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost.
The financial risks associated with LGIMs businesses are directly borne by the investors in its funds.
Therefore detailed risk disclosures have not been presented.

9 Assets analysis The group has categorised its assets and liabilities in the following disclosure in accordance with the level of shareholder exposure to market and credit risks.
The four categories presented are: Unit linked For unit linked contracts, there is a direct link between the investments and the obligations.
Unit linked business is written in both Society and Legal & General Assurance Pensions Management Limited.
The financial risk on these contracts is borne by the policyholders.
The group is therefore not directly exposed to any market risk, currency risk or credit risk for these contracts.
As a result, risk disclosures have not been presented for unit linked assets and liabilities.
With-profits Policyholders and shareholders share in the risks and returns of the with-profits fund.
The return to shareholders on virtually all participating products is in the form of a transfer to shareholders equity, which is analogous to a dividend from the fund and is dependent upon the bonuses credited or declared on policies in that year.
The bonuses are broadly based on historic and current rates of return on equity, property and fixed income securities, as well as expectations of future investment returns.
The with-profits classification excludes unit linked contracts.
Non profit non-unit linked Shareholders are exposed to the risk and rewards of ownership of assets backing non profit non-unit linked business held in the UK with-profits fund, which comprises annuities, protection and non profit savings products.

The value of business acquired represents the present value of anticipated future profits in acquired contracts.
These amounts are amortised over the anticipated lives of the related contracts in the portfolio.
Intangible assets acquired via business combinations, such as the value of customer relationships, are recognised at fair value and are subsequently amortised over their useful life in line with the expected emergence of profit from the business.
Where software costs are separately identifiable and measurable they are capitalised at cost and amortised over their expected useful life.
Purchased interest in long term businesses and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

These are accounted for in line with the appropriate accounting standards as follows: Long term insurance business Acquisition costs comprise direct costs, such as initial commission, and the indirect costs of obtaining and processing new business.
Acquisition costs relating to non-participating insurance contracts written outside the with-profits fund which are incurred during a financial year are deferred by use of an asset which is amortised over the period during which the costs are expected to be recoverable, and in accordance with the expected incidence of future related margins.
For participating contracts, acquisition costs are charged to the income statement when incurred.
General insurance A proportion of commission and other acquisition costs relating to unearned premiums is carried forward as deferred acquisition costs or, in respect of reinsurance outwards, as deferred income.
Investment contracts For participating investment contracts, acquisition costs comprise direct costs such as initial commission and the indirect costs of obtaining and processing new business.
These costs are charged to the income statement when incurred.
For non-participating investment contracts, only directly attributable costs relating to investment management services which vary with, and are related to, securing new contracts and renewing existing contracts, are capitalised and amortised over the period during which the costs are expected to be recoverable from future revenue.
All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 133 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued 12 Financial investments and investment property The group holds financial investments and investment property to back insurance contracts on behalf of policyholders and as group capital.
The group classifies its financial investments on initial recognition as held for trading HFT, designated at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, available-for-sale AFS or loans and receivables.
Initial recognition of financial investments is on the trade date.
The groups policy is to measure investments at FVTPL except for certain overseas assets where the related liability is valued on a passive basis not using current information, in which case investments are classified as AFS or loans and receivables.
All derivatives other than those designated as hedges are classified as HFT.
Certain financial investments held by the group are designated as FVTPL as their performance is evaluated on a total return basis, consistent with asset performance reporting to the Group Investment and Market Risk Committee and the groups investment strategy.
Assets designated as FVTPL include debt securities including lifetime mortgages and equity instruments which would otherwise have been classified as AFS or loans and receivables under IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
Assets backing participating and non-participating policyholder liabilities outside the US are designated as FVTPL.
For participating contracts the assets are managed on a fair value basis to maximise the total return to policyholders over the contract life.
The groups non-participating investment contract liabilities outside of the US are measured on the basis of current information and are designated as FVTPL to avoid an accounting mismatch in the income statement.
The fair values of quoted financial investments are based on bid prices, which management believe to be representative of fair value.
If the market for a financial investment is not active, the group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques such as recent arms length transactions, consensus market pricing, reference to similar listed investments, discounted cash flow models or option pricing models.
Private equity investments are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines, which represent current best practice, developed by the Association Franais des Investisseurs en Capital, the British Venture Capital Association and the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association.
The techniques used for determining fair value include earnings multiples, the price of a recent investment, net asset basis or discounted cash flow.
Financial investments classified as HFT and FVTPL are measured at fair value with gains and losses reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Financial investments classified as AFS are measured at fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised in a separate reserve within equity.
Realised gains and losses, impairment losses, dividends, interest and foreign exchange movements on non-equity instruments are reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Directly attributable transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the investment.
Financial investments are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial investments are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the investment expire, or when the group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity.
Financial assets, other than those at fair value, are assessed for impairment at each balance sheet date.
They are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events after initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected.
Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus acquisition costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Investment property comprises land and buildings which are held for long term rental yields and capital growth.
It is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within investment return.
Investment property in the UK is valued bi-annually by external chartered surveyors at open market values in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or using internal valuations and estimates during the intervening period.
Outside the UK, valuations are produced in conjunction with external qualified professional valuers in the countries concerned.
In the event of a material change in market conditions between the valuation date and balance sheet date, an internal valuation is performed and adjustments made to reflect any material changes in fair value.
The group receives and pledges collateral in the form of cash or non-cash assets in respect of various transactions, in order to reduce the credit risk of these transactions.
The amount and type of collateral required where the group receives collateral depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty.
134 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued Collateral received in the form of cash, where the group has contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated, is recognised as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding liability for its repayment.
Non-cash collateral received is not recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, unless the counterparty defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement.
Non-cash collateral pledged where the group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated is not derecognised from Consolidated Balance Sheet, unless the group defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement.
Cash collateral pledged, where the counterparty has contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated, is derecognised from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and a corresponding receivable is recognised for its return.
Future developments In July 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 9, Financial instruments which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The ISAB subsequently issued Amendments to IFRS 4: Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts which allows entities which meet certain requirements to defer their implementation of IFRS 9 subject to EU endorsement.
On adoption, IFRS 9 contains three key elements: A principle-based model for classification and measurement of financial instruments driven by cash ow characteristics and the business model in which an asset is held.
Financial assets are classified under either amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI or fair value through profit and loss: A single expected loss impairment model that will require more timely recognition of expected credit losses on assets classified as amortised cost or FVOCI.
Specifically, the new standard requires entities to account for expected credit losses from when financial instruments are first recognised, and it lowers the threshold for recognition of full lifetime expected losses: and A substantially reformed model for hedge accounting with enhanced disclosures about risk management activities, enabling entities to better reect these activities in their financial statements.
The impact of IFRS 9 on the groups financial statements will depend on the interaction of the asset classification and measurement with the insurance contract measurement at the date of transition, particularly for liabilities which are measured using locked in discount rates.
The IASB have given insurers the opportunity to apply for a deferral of IFRS 9 until the earlier of the implementation of the new insurance standard or 1 January 2021.
For an insurer to apply this deferral, total liabilities related to insurance must exceed 90% of total liabilities: or total liabilities related to insurance are greater than 80% of total liabilities but less than 90% of total liabilities so long as the insurer does not engage in significant activity unconnected to insurance.
Total liabilities connected to insurance within the group at 31 December 2016 were 99% of total liabilities and the group will therefore qualify, and expects to apply the deferral of IFRS 9.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 137 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued 12 Financial investments and investment property continued ii Collateralised debt The group holds collateralised debt obligations CDOs at FVTPL with a market value of 73m at 2016 2015: 1,173m.
In 2015, the holdings included 1,000m relating to four CDOs that were constructed in 2007 and 2008 in accordance with terms specified by the group as part of a strategic review of the assets backing the annuity portfolio.
The group selected at outset and managed the reference portfolios underlying the CDOs to give exposure to globally diversified portfolios of investment grade corporate bonds.
The group was able to substitute the constituents of the original reference portfolios with new reference assets, allowing the management of the underlying credit risk although there have been no substitutions in 2015 or 2016.
These notes were restructured in October 2016 and they are no longer leveraged super senior CDOs, but unlevered exposures backed by corporate and structured finance.
As such the below information relates to 2015 only.
A breakdown of the underlying CDO reference portfolio by sector is provided below: 2015 Sector % Banks 14 Utilities 10 Consumer Services and Goods 25 Financial Services 6 Technology and Telecoms 9 Insurance 6 Industrials 20 Oil and Gas 6 Health Care 4 100 The CDOs were termed as super senior since default losses on the reference portfolio had to exceed 27.5%, on average across the four CDOs, before the CDOs incurred any default losses.
Assuming an average recovery rate of 30%, over 39% of the reference names would have had to default before the CDOs incurred any default losses.
Beyond 27.5% of default losses on the reference portfolio, losses to the CDOs would have occurred at a rate that was a multiple of the loss rate on the reference portfolio.
For illustration, a 200m loss could have been incurred if default losses to the reference portfolios exceeded 30.4% or if 43.5% of the names in the reference portfolio defaulted with an average 30% recovery rate.
All figures were averages across the four CDOs.
The underlying reference portfolio had no reference entity defaults in 2015.
Losses were limited under the terms of the CDOs to assets and collateral invested.
These CDOs also incorporated features under which, in certain circumstances, the group could have chosen either to post additional cash collateral or to allow wind up of the structures.
These features were dependent on the portfolios weighted average spreads, default experience to date and time to maturity.
No additional collateral was posted to any of the CDOs during 2016 2015: nil.
During 2016, the group received nil 2015: nil of previously posted collateral.
The amount of the cash equivalent collateral attached to CDOs during the year is nil 2015: 2m.
These CDOs were valued using an external valuation based on observable market inputs, which include CDX and iTraxx index tranches and CDS spreads on underlying reference entities.
This was then validated against the internal valuation.
Unit linked CDOs were excluded from the analysis as the risk is retained by the policyholders.

There are no material differences between the carrying values reflected above and the fair values of these loans.
iv Fair value hierarchy Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Fair value measurements are based on observable and unobservable inputs.
Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the groups view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
The group utilises techniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.
The levels of fair value measurement bases are defined as follows: Level 1: fair values measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for any input for the asset or liability significant to the measurement that is not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of the groups level 2 assets have been valued using standard market pricing sources, such as iBoxx, IDC and Bloomberg, which use mathematical modelling and multiple source validation in order to determine consensus prices, except for bespoke CDO and swaps holdings see below.
In normal market conditions, we would consider these market prices to be observable market prices.
Following consultation with our pricing providers and a number of their contributing brokers, we have considered that these prices are not from a suitably active market and have classified them as level 2.
The CDOs are valued using an external valuation based on observable market inputs, which include CDX and iTraxx index tranches and CDS spreads on underlying reference entities.
This is then validated against the internal valuation.
Accordingly, these assets have also been classified in level 2.
The groups policy is to re-assess categorisation of financial assets at the end of each reporting period and to recognise transfers between levels at that point in time.
There have been no significant transfers between level 1 and level 2 in 2016 2015: nil.

140 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued a Assets measured at fair value based on level 3 Level 3 assets where internal models are used, represent a small proportion of assets to which shareholders are exposed, comprise both property and unquoted equities, the latter including investments in private equity, property vehicles and suspended securities.
In many situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
In these situations, the group determines the level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value.
As a result, both observable and unobservable inputs may be used in the determination of fair values that the group has classified within level 3.
The group determines the fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities based on quoted market prices, where available.
The group also determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted at the appropriate current market rate.
As appropriate, fair values reflect adjustments for counterparty credit quality, the groups credit standing, liquidity and risk margins on unobservable inputs.
Where quoted market prices are not available, fair value estimates are made at a point in time, based on relevant market data, as well as the best information about the individual financial instrument.
Illiquid market conditions have resulted in inactive markets for certain of the groups financial instruments.
As a result, there is generally no or limited observable market data for these assets and liabilities.
Fair value estimates for financial instruments deemed to be in an illiquid market are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, liquidity discounts, currency, credit and interest rate risks, loss experience and other factors.
These fair values are estimates and involve considerable uncertainty and variability as a result of the inputs selected and may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed, and the differences could be material.
As a result, such calculated fair value estimates may not be realisable in an immediate sale or settlement of the instrument.
In addition, changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique could significantly affect these fair value estimates.
Fair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that input variables and outputs are assessed independent of the risk taker.
These inputs and outputs are reviewed and approved by a valuation committee and validated independently as appropriate.
Other financial investments comprise debt securities, lifetime mortgages and derivative assets.
The realised and unrealised gains and losses have been recognised in investment return in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The group holds regular discussions with its pricing providers to determine whether transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy have occurred.
The above transfers occurred as a result of this process.
In 2016, transfers into level 3 included 1.6bn of commercial real estate loans, which were previously classified as level 2.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 143 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued 13 Derivative assets and liabilities The groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The group uses derivatives such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The group uses hedge accounting, provided the prescribed criteria in IAS 39 are met, to recognise the offsetting effects of changes in the fair value or cash flow of the derivative instrument and the hedged item.
The groups principal uses of hedge accounting are to: i Recognise in shareholders equity the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
Any cumulative gains and or losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on disposal of the foreign operation: ii Defer in equity the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as the hedge of a future cash flow attributable to a recognised asset or liability, a highly probable forecast transaction, or a firm commitment until the period in which the future transaction affects profit or loss or is no longer expected to occur: and iii Hedge the fair value movements in loans due to interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations.
Any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, are documented at the inception of the transaction.
The effectiveness of the hedge is documented and monitored on an ongoing basis.
Hedge accounting is only applied for highly effective hedges between 80% and 125% effectiveness with any ineffective portion of the gain or loss recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, within other expenses, in the current year.
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Where the risks and characteristics of derivatives embedded in other contracts are not closely related to those of the host contract and the whole contract is not carried at fair value, the derivative is separated from that host contract and measured at fair value, with fair value movements reflected within investment return, unless the embedded derivative itself meets the definition of an insurance contract.
Cash inflows and outflows are presented on a net basis where the group is required to settle net or has a legally enforceable right of offset and the intention is to settle on a net basis.

If the carrying value of a financial asset is impaired, the carrying value is reduced through a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement.
There must be objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events which have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset.
Impairment is only recognised if the loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of assets held at amortised cost or fair value of assets classified as AFS.
Assets which are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

rates are monitored with adverse trends being subject to actuarial investigation.
For insured contracts, terms and conditions typically include surrender deductions to mitigate the risk.
In later periods, once the acquisition costs have been recouped, the effect of lapses and surrenders depends upon the relationship between the exit benefit, if any, and the liability for that contract.
Exit benefits are not generally guaranteed and the group has some discretionin determining the amount of the payment.
As a result, the effect on profit in later periods is expected to be broadly neutral.
Expense risk LGR, LGI In determining pricing assumptions, account is taken of changes in price indices and In pricing long term insurance business, and Savings the costs of employment, with stress testing used to evaluate the effect of significant assumptions are made as to the future cost deviations.

significant impact on the level of claims Reinsurance arrangements are used to further mitigate the risk.
Accumulation of risks There is limited potential for single incidents to give rise to a large number of claims across the different contract types written by the group.
In particular, there is little significant overlap between the long term and short term insurance business written by the group.
However, there are potentially material correlations of insurance risk with other types of risk exposure.
The groups capital model seeks to measure risk correlations particularly those that would tend to be more acute as the underlying risk scenarios become more extreme.
An example of the accumulation of risk is the correlation between reinsurer credit risk with mortality and morbidity exposures.
Operational risk Operational risk is defined as loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or external events.
Potential for exposure to operational risk extends to all the groups businesses.
The group has constructed a framework of internal controls to minimise material loss from operational risk events recognising that no system of internal control can completely eliminate the risk of error, financial loss, fraudulent action or reputational damage.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 157 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued 19 Long term insurance valuation assumptions The group's insurance assumptions, described below, relate exclusively to the UK insurance business.
The non-UK businesses do not constitute a material component of the group's operations and consideration of geographically determined assumptions is therefore not included.
i Non-participating business For its non-participating business, the group seeks to make prudent assumptions about its future experience based on current market conditions and recent experience.
The approach used to set non-participating assumptions is generally similar to that previously used to determine the assumptions used for Solvency I and there has been no material change in approach as a result of the new Solvency II regulatory regime coming into effect on 1 January 2016.
These assumptions incorporate prudent margins in excess of our best estimate assumptions to reduce the possibility of actual experience being less favourable than assumed.
There are no material changes to overall non-economic prudent assumptions or the minimum prudent economic margins at 2016 arising from the regular review of these prudent margins.
Valuation rates of interest and discount rates The valuation interest rate for each contract type is based on the yield on the assets backing the contract adjusted for the risk that asset proceeds are not received by the group.
For some business, this yield is the gross redemption yield or appropriate forward yield on fixed interest securities and the running yield on variable interest securities.
For other business it is the Internal Rate of Return on the portfolio of backing assets.
In 2016, the group continued to hold an additional reserve to protect against the risk of an uplift in defaults in the current economic environment and maintained the level of the long term default allowance at 42bps per annum 2015: 40bps for unapproved securities and property backing non profit business.
For approved securities and swaps backing the non profit annuity business, the allowance is 9bps per annum 2015: 9bps.
For unapproved securities backing non profit annuity business, the credit default allowances equate to 55bps per annum 2015: 55bps when expressed over the duration of the assets held, leading to an overall total default provision of 2.7bn 2015: 2.2bn.
The group believes that the total default allowance is prudent to cover all reasonably foreseeable circumstances.
For equity investments, the yield is based on the current dividend yield, adjusted for prudence.
For property holdings, yields are based on the rental income payable.
Mortality and morbidity Mortality and morbidity assumptions are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau CMIB of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and or UK death registrations, with an appropriate allowance for prudence.
These tables are based on industry-wide mortality and morbidity experience for insured lives.
The majority of internal statistical investigations are carried out at least annually to determine the extent to which the groups experience differs from that of the industry and suggest appropriate adjustments which need to be made to the valuation assumptions.
Persistency The group monitors its persistency experience and carries out detailed investigations annually.
Persistency can be volatile and past experience may not be an appropriate future indicator.
The group tries to balance past experience and future conditions by making prudent assumptions about the future expected long term average persistency levels.
For non-participating contracts where explicit persistency assumptions are not made, prudence is also incorporated into the liabilities by ensuring that they are sufficient to cover the more onerous of the two scenarios where the policies either remain in-force until maturity or where they discontinue at the valuation date.
Expenses The group monitors its expense experience and carries out detailed investigations regularly to determine the expenses incurred in writing and administering the different products and classes of business.
Adjustments may be made for known future changes in the administration processes, in line with the groups business plan.
An allowance for expense inflation in the future is also made, taking account of both salary and price information.
The expense assumptions also include an appropriate allowance for prudence.
158 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued Premiums For those contracts where the policyholder does not have the right to vary the amount of the premium paid, full credit is taken for the premiums contractually due at the valuation date.
For contracts where the policyholder has the option to vary the rate of premium, the provision is taken as being the higher of the amount calculated as if the policyholder continues to make premium payments or, alternatively, ceases to pay premiums altogether.
ii Participating business For its participating business, the group seeks to establish its liabilities at their realistic value in line with the requirements set out in FRS 27.
Although FRS 27 is no longer an operational standard, the group has grandfathered the provisions into its IFRS reserving methodology.
Non-economic assumptions Non-economic assumptions are set to represent the groups best estimates of future experience.
Premiums For those contracts where the policyholder does not have the right to vary the amount of the premium paid, full credit is taken for the premiums contractually due at the valuation date.
Economic assumptions Realistic reporting requires a market consistent economic model.
The model is calibrated using market data from a variety of market sources.
This enables assumptions to be determined for the term structure of risk free interest rates, and for property and equity volatility.
Risk free interest rates are determined with reference to the swap yield curve on the valuation date less a credit risk adjustment CRA of 17bps for 2016 2015: gilt yield curve on the valuation date increased by ten basis points.
Property volatility is set with reference to historic variations in property prices.
Equity volatility is set so that the model reproduces observed market prices of traded equity derivatives.
Correlations between asset classes are based on historic data.
Each investment scenario contains a consistent set of assumptions for investment returns and inflation.
Future bonuses Future reversionary and terminal bonuses are consistent with the bonus policies set out in the Societys Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM.
Guaranteed annuity options The guarantees are valued on a market consistent basis.
The valuation methodology allows for the correlation between interest rates and the proportion of the policyholders who take up the option.
Guaranteed cash options The liability is determined assuming that policyholders choose the most valuable alternative between the annuity and cash available at retirement.
Value of in-force non-participating contracts The group makes a deduction from the liabilities for the expected value of future profits arising on non-participating contracts written in the with-profits part of the Society Long Term Fund.
The economic assumptions used to calculate the value of these profits are consistent with those used to calculate liabilities for with-profits business.
Non-economic assumptions represent best estimates of expected future experience on this business.

160 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued Persistency assumptions Lapse rates assumptions are used in the valuation of certain classes of long term business.
Where this is the case, the valuation persistency basis is set by applying a prudential margin over the best estimate assumptions.
The tables below show the major products where lapse rates have been used.
For term assurance business, the margin acts to increase the best estimate lapse rate in the early part of a policys lifetime when it is treated as an asset but to reduce the best estimate lapse rate later in the policys lifetime when it is treated as a liability.
Any liability to reinsurers on discontinuance within the first four years from inception is allowed for explicitly in the cash flows, using the valuation lapse basis, together with a prudent allowance for clawback of commission from agents upon lapse.
For unitised business, the margin acts to either increase or decrease the best estimate lapse rates, depending upon which approach results in the higher liability.
The direction of the margin is assessed for unit life business and unit pensions business separately.
A summary of the lapse basis for major classes of non-profit business is shown below.

164 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued The interest rate sensitivity assumes a 100bps change in the gross redemption yield on fixed interest securities together with a 100bps change in the real yields on variable securities.
For the UK with-profit funds, valuation interest rates are assumed to move in line with market yields adjusted to allow for the impact of PRA regulations.
The interest rate sensitivities reflect the impact of the regulatory restrictions on the reinvestment rate used to value the liabilities of the long term business.
No yield floors have been applied in the estimation of the stresses, despite the current low interest rate environment.
Interest rate and inflation expectation have historically shown positive correlation and have therefore been presented next to each other.
The inflation stress adopted is a 100bps p. a. increase in inflation resulting in a 100bps p. a. reduction in real yield and no change to the nominal yield.
In addition the expense inflation rate is increased by 100bps p. a.
In the sensitivity for credit spreads, corporate bond yields have increased by 100bps, gilt and approved security yields are unchanged, and there has been no adjustment to the default assumptions.
The equity stress is a 10% fall in listed equity market values.
The property stress adopted is a 10% fall in property market value.
Rental income is assumed to be unchanged: however the vacant possession value is stressed down by 10% in line with the market value stress.
Where property is being used to back liabilities, the valuation interest rate used to place a value on the liabilities moves with the implied change in property yields.
The annuitant mortality stress is a 100bps reduction in the mortality rates for immediate and deferred annuitants with no change to the mortality improvement rates.
The assurance mortality stress represents an increase in mortality morbidity rates for assurance contracts by 5%.
The credit default stress assumes a -10bps stress to the current credit default assumption for unapproved corporate bonds which will have an impact on the valuation interest rates used to discount liabilities.
The credit default assumption is set based on the credit rating of the individual bonds in the asset portfolio and their outstanding term using Moodys global credit default rates.
For any single event with claims in excess of 30m 2015: 30m but less than 509m 2015: 496m the ultimate cost to Legal & General Insurance Limited LGI would be 30m plus 50% of the 5m XS 30m layer 2015: 30m plus 50% of the 5m XS 30m layer plus the cost of the reinsurance reinstatement premium.
The ultimate cost to the group is greater as a proportion of the catastrophe reinsurance cover placed with Legal & General Assurance Society Limited, which is exposed to 75% of claims between 35m and 100m, 75% of claims between 100m and 250m and 45% of claims between 250m and 478m.
The impact of a 1 in 500 year modelled windstorm and coastal flood event would exceed the upper limit of the catastrophe cover by approximately 280m 2015: 270m, with an estimated total cost to Legal & General Insurance Limited of 335m 2015: 330m and to the group of 590m 2015: 563m.
The above sensitivity analyses do not reflect management actions which could be taken to reduce the impacts.
The group seeks to actively manage its asset and liability position.
A change in market conditions may lead to changes in the asset allocation or charging structure which may have a more, or less, significant impact on the value of the liabilities.
The analyses also ignore any second order effects of the assumption change, including the potential impact on the group asset and liability position and any second order tax effects.
In calculating the alternative values, all other assumptions are left unchanged, though in practice, items may be correlated.
The sensitivity of the profit and equity to changes in assumptions may not be linear.
These results should not be extrapolated to changes of a much larger order, which could be significantly more or less than the amounts shown above.
LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 165 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued 21 Insurance contract liabilities Insurance contracts are contracts which transfer significant insurance risk to the insurer at the inception of the contract.
A number of insurance and investment contracts contain discretionary participating features DPF which entitle the policyholders to receive guaranteed benefits as well as additional benefits: the amount or timing of which is contractually at the discretion of the group: and which are contractually based on: the performance of a specified pool of contracts or a specified type of contract: realised and or unrealised investment returns on a specified pool of assets held by the issuer: or the profit or loss of the Company, fund or other entity which issues the contract.
Contracts with DPF are referred to as participating contracts.
With-profits contracts in the UK and previously most Garantie Long Terme contracts in France were classified as participating.
Long term insurance Death claims are accounted for on notification of death.
Surrenders for non-linked policies are accounted for when payment is made.
Critical illness claims are accounted for when admitted.
All other long term claims and surrenders are accounted for when payment is due.
Claims payable include the direct costs of settlement.
The change in the insurance liability reflects the reduction in liabilities due to the payment of claims in the year, offset by liabilities arising from new business.
The movement also reflects assumption changes relating to variables such as claims expectations, expenses and the unwind of the previous periods expectations.
Under current IFRS requirements, insurance contract liabilities are measured using local Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP, as permitted by IFRS 4, Insurance contracts.
UK In the UK, insurance contract liabilities are determined following an annual investigation of the insurance entities in accordance with regulatory requirements.
For non-participating insurance contracts, the liabilities are calculated on the basis of current information using the gross premium valuation method.
This brings into account the full premiums receivable under contracts written, having prudent regard to expected lapses and surrenders, estimated renewal and maintenance costs and contractually guaranteed benefits.
For unit linked insurance contract liabilities the provision is based on the fund value together with an allowance for any excess of future expenses over charges where appropriate.
For participating contracts, the liabilities to policyholders are determined on a realistic basis in accordance with guidance previously set out in Financial Reporting Standard FRS 27, Life assurance.
This includes an assessment of the cost of any future options and guarantees granted to policyholders valued on a market consistent basis.
The calculation also takes account of bonus decisions which are consistent with Legal & General Assurance Society Limiteds Societys Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM.
The shareholders share of the future cost of bonuses is excluded from the assessment of the realistic liability.
In determining the realistic value of liabilities for participating contracts, the value of future profits on non-participating business written in the with-profits part of the fund is accounted for as part of the calculation.
The present value of future profits PVFP for this business is separately determined and its value is deducted from the sum of the liabilities for participating contracts and the unallocated divisible surplus.
Unitised liabilities are recognised when premiums are received and non-unitised liabilities are recognised when premiums are due.
Overseas All annuity business written by overseas subsidiaries is recognised in line with those written in the UK.
All other long term insurance contract liabilities for business transacted by overseas subsidiaries are determined on the basis of recognised actuarial methods which reflect local supervisory principles or, in the case of the US, on the basis of US GAAP.
166 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued General insurance Liabilities, together with related reinsurance recoveries, are established on the basis of current information.
Such liabilities can never be definitive as to their timing or the amount of claims and are therefore subject to subsequent reassessment on a regular basis.
Claims and related reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in respect of all incidents up to the year end.
Provision is made on the basis of available information for the estimated ultimate cost, including claims settlement expenses, claims reported but not yet settled and claims incurred but not yet reported.
An unexpired risk provision is made for any overall excess of expected claims and deferred acquisition costs over unearned premiums and after taking account of investment return.
Liability adequacy tests The group performs liability adequacy testing on its insurance liabilities to ensure that the carrying amount of liabilities less related deferred acquisition costs is sufficient to cover current estimates of future cash flows.
When performing the liability adequacy test, the group discounts all contractual cash flows and compares this amount with the carrying value of the liability.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the Consolidated Income Statement, initially reducing deferred acquisition costs and then by establishing a provision for losses.
Reinsurance The groups insurance subsidiaries cede insurance premiums and risk in the normal course of business in order to limit the potential for losses and to provide financing.
Outwards reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the related premiums for the direct or inwards reinsurance business being reinsured.
Reinsurance assets include balances due from reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future life policy benefits.
Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy.
Reinsurance is recorded as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless a right of offset exists, in which case the associated liabilities are reduced commensurately.
Contracts with reinsurers are assessed to determine whether they contain significant insurance risk.
Contracts that do not give rise to significant transfer of insurance risk to the reinsurer are considered to be financial reinsurance and are accounted for and disclosed in a manner consistent with financial instruments.

Insurance contract undiscounted cash flows are based on the expected date of settlement.
Amounts under unit linked contracts are generally repayable on demand and the group is responsible for ensuring there is sufficient liquidity within the asset portfolio to enable liabilities to unit linked policyholders to be met as they fall due.
However, the terms of funds investing in less liquid assets permit the deferral of redemptions for predefined periods in circumstances where there are not sufficient liquid assets within the fund to meet the level of requested redemptions.
Accordingly, unit linked liabilities have been excluded from the table.

In the UK, participating investment contract liabilities are determined in accordance with guidance previously set out in FRS 27, including a value for guarantees, in the same way as participating insurance contracts.
The groups non-participating investment contracts are all unit linked contracts.
These liabilities are measured at fair value by reference to the value of the underlying net asset values of the groups unitised investment funds at the balance sheet date.
Claims are not included in the income statement but are deducted from investment contract liabilities.
The movement in investment contract liabilities consists of claims incurred in the year less the corresponding elimination of the policyholder liability originally recognised in the balance sheet and the investment return credited to policyholders.
Future developments IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, issued in May 2014, is effective, for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
This standard provides clear guidance over when and how much revenue should be recognised.
It provides a principles-based approach for revenue recognition, and introduces the concept of recognising revenue for obligations as they are satisfied.
An assessment is currently on-going to determine the impact upon the group, focussing in particular on our investment management business.
The standard does not apply to business classified as insurance contracts.
The group does not intend to early adopt this standard.

Undiscounted interest payments are estimated based on the year end applicable interest rate and spot exchange rates.
As at 31 December 2016, the group had in place a 1bn syndicated committed revolving credit facility provided by a number of its key relationship banks, maturing in December 2021.
No amounts were outstanding at 31 December 2016.

178 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued 26 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Where the group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
The group recognises a provision for onerous contracts when the expected benefits to be derived from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract.

It is classified as held for sale as at 31 December 2016.
The group pays contractual contributions in respect of defined contribution schemes.
The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.
Contributions of 51m 2015: 51m were charged as expenses during the year in respect of defined contribution plans.
Defined benefit plans The group operates the following defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and overseas: Legal & General Group UK Pension and Assurance Fund the Fund.
The Fund was closed to new members from January 1995: the last full actuarial valuation was as at 31 December 2012.
Legal & General Group UK Senior Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme was, with a few exceptions principally transfers from the Fund, closed to new members from August 2000 and finally closed to new members from April 2007: the last full actuarial valuation was as at 31 December 2012.
Legal & General America Inc. Cash Balance Plan US : the last full actuarial valuation was as at 31 December 2014.
The UK schemes operate within the UK pensions regulatory framework.
The UK Fund and Scheme were closed to future accrual on 31 December 2015.
As part of this arrangement, payments to the Fund and Scheme in respect of future accruals will cease from this date and be replaced with a company contribution payment of between 5% and 15%.
In addition, as part of the closure, the company will contribute an additional 3m per annum over the next 9 years towards the deficit.
The assets of all UK defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds to meet long term pension obligations to past and present employees.
Trustees are appointed to the schemes and have a responsibility to act in the best interest of the scheme beneficiaries.
The trustees long term objectives are to minimise the risk that there are insufficient assets to meet the liabilities of the scheme over the longer term, control the on-going operational costs of the schemes and to maximise investment returns for the beneficiaries within an acceptable level of risk.

Each UK scheme has a Statement of Investment Principles which governs the mix of assets and limits for each class of asset.
As noted below the asset mix of the schemes is primarily split between bonds, LDI funds and equities.
Additionally certain of the liabilities of the scheme are secured by way of annuities purchased from the group.
These annuities are not recognised as an asset for IAS 19 purposes but at 31 December 2016 the value of these annuities, on an IAS 19 basis, was 779m 2015: 746m.
The Scheme and Fund are primarily exposed to equity price risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and longevity risk.
These risks are managed within the risk appetite of the Scheme and Fund and the sensitivity of the net obligations to changes in any of the variables are monitored and action is taken if any risk moves outside of the appetite.
Annuities are purchased to mitigate these risks for certain parts of the pension liabilities which passes the risks from the Scheme and Fund onto the group.
Full actuarial valuations are carried out on the Scheme and Fund every three years, updated by formal reviews at each reporting date.
The actuarial assumptions used in the triennial valuation would normally be more prudent than those used for the purposes of IAS 19 reporting.
Where the Scheme or Fund are in deficit following the triennial valuation, the group and the trustee agree a deficit recovery plan.
Both the Scheme and Fund have formal deficit recovery plans which agree to make good the deficits over a certain period of time.
The triennial valuation at 31 December 2012 showed a total funding deficit for both the Scheme and the Fund of 494m.
As a result of this, a recovery plan was agreed of 55m a year until 2024.
The latest triennial valuation at 31 December 2015 is on-going and due to be completed shortly.
The Scheme and the Fund liabilities have an average duration of 20.7 years 2015: 19.3 years and 20.8 years 2015: 19.4 years respectively.
The expected undiscounted benefits payments to members of the Scheme and Fund, including pensions in payment secured by annuities purchased from the group, are shown in the chart below: 180 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued The liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the Balance Sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, provided any surplus in the fund is not restricted.
Plan assets exclude any insurance contracts issued by the group.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated actuarially each year using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows.
The discount rate is based on market yields of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity which approximate to those of the related pension liability.
Where the unallocated divisible surplus or equity holders funds are affected as a result of actuarial gains and losses on the defined benefit pension scheme, the charge or credit is not recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement but through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The benefits paid from the defined benefit schemes are based on percentages of the employees final pensionable salary for each year of credited service.
The group has no liability for retirement benefits other than for pensions.
The Fund and Scheme account for all of the UK and over 97% of worldwide assets of the groups defined benefit schemes.
The principal actuarial assumptions for the UK defined benefit schemes were: Fund and Fund and Scheme Scheme 2016 2015 % % Rate used to discount liabilities 2.70 3.80 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.70 3.60 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.82 3.66 Rate of general inflation RPI 3.25 3.00 Rate of CPI inflation 2.55 2.30 Post retirement mortality 2016: 80% 90% Male Female Fund and 70% 80% Male Female Scheme of PCMA PCFA 00 with improvement at CMI 2014 base date 2013 with long term rates 1.5% p. a. males and 1.0% p. a. females, with tapering linearly down to nil between ages 90 and 120.

For relevant non-participating investment contracts, a liability for the present value of this future commission cost is recognised in the balance sheet on inception of the contract.
The present value of future commission costs is deferred as an asset and amortised over the period during which the related revenue will be recognised.
At each subsequent reporting date the liability is re-measured to fair value because this financial liability is part of a portfolio of unit linked assets and liabilities whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis.
Any increase in the liability is recognised as an additional deferred cost.
Any change in lapse assumptions or revisions to the underlying assumptions for future cash flows will be reflected in the fair value movement for a year.
If the future commission liability decreases, a corresponding adjustment is made to the amortisation of the asset.
The repurchase agreements are presented gross, however they and their related assets are subject to master netting arrangements.
Other financial liabilities include obligations in respect of collateral received from derivative contracts of 2.7bn 2015: 0.1bn.
Other also includes the present value of future commission costs which have contingent settlement provisions of 177m 2015: 175m.

184 LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued 28 Management of capital resources Solvency II The group is required to measure and monitor its capital resources on a regulatory basis and to comply with the minimum capital requirements of regulators in each territory in which it operates.
The group had to comply with the requirements established by the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA at the balance sheet date.
Following the implementation of Solvency II regulatory regime which came into force on 1 January 2016, the groups capital resources are managed on a Solvency II basis.
The Solvency II results are estimated and unaudited.
The table below shows the estimated group Own Funds, Solvency Capital Requirement and Surplus own funds of the group, based on the Internal Model and Matching Adjustment approved by the PRA.
This incorporates the estimated impacts of a recalculation of the Transitional Measures for Technical Provisions Estimated TMTP recalculated based on end 2016 economic conditions and changes during 2016 to the Internal Model and Matching Adjustment.
The Estimated TMTP has been amortised to end 2016.
The conditions for the PRA to allow a formal recalculation of the groups TMTP were not met as at end 2016.
In line with PRA guidance, we expect to undertake a formal recalculation of the TMTP on or before 1 January 2018, i. e. when PRA conditions are met or two years from the date of commencement of the Solvency II regime.
1 As at 31 December 2016, and on the above basis, the group had a Solvency II surplus of 5.7bn 2015 : 5.5bn over its Solvency Capital 1 1 Requirement, corresponding to a coverage ratio of 171% 2015 :176%.
The shareholder view of Solvency II capital position is as follows: 2016 2015 bn bn 1, 2 Core tier 1 Own Funds 11.0 10.6 Tier 1 subordinated liabilities 0.6 0.6 Tier 2 subordinated liabilities 2.1 2.0 Eligibility restrictions 0.1 0.4 1, 2 Own Funds 13.6 12.8 1, 3 Solvency Capital Requirement SCR 7.9 7.3 Surplus 5.7 5.5 4 SCR coverage ratio 171% 176% 1.
O wn Funds and SCR are on a shareholder view basis.
This excludes the contribution to SCR of with-profits fund and final salary pension schemes from both Own funds and SCR.
These exclusions have no impact on Solvency II surplus.
The 2015 comparatives have been restated on this basis.
Own Funds do not include an accrual for the dividend of 616m 2015: 592m declared after the balance sheet date.
The SCR is not subject to audit.
Coverage ratio is on an unrounded basis.

LEGAL & GENERAL GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 185 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Balance sheet management continued 28 Management of capital resources continued Capital management policies and objectives The group aims to manage its capital resources to maintain financial strength, policyholder security and relative external ratings advantage.
The group also seeks to maximise its financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and by utilising a range of alternative sources of capital including equity, senior debt, subordinated debt and reinsurance.
Capital measures The group measures its capital on a number of different bases, including those which comply with the regulatory frameworks within which the group operates and those which the directors consider most appropriate for managing the business.
The measures used by the group include: Accounting and Economic bases Management use financial information prepared on both an IFRS and Economic Capital basis to manage capital and cash flow usage and to determine dividend paying capacity.
The group maintains a risk-based capital model that is used to calculate the groups Economic Capital balance sheet and support the management of risk within the group.
This modelling framework, suitably adjusted for regulatory constraints, also meets the needs of the Solvency II regime.
Our Economic Capital model has not been reviewed by the Prudential Regulatory Authority PRA, nor will it be.
Regulatory bases The financial strength of the groups insurance subsidiaries is measured under various local regulatory requirements see below.
Basis of regulatory capital and corresponding regulatory capital requirements In each country in which the group operates, the local insurance regulator specifies rules and guidance for the minimum amount and type of capital which must be held by insurance subsidiaries in excess of their insurance liabilities.
The minimum capital requirements have been maintained at all times throughout the year.
This helps to ensure that payments to policyholders can be made as they fall due.
The required capital is calculated by either assessing the additional assets which would be required to meet the insurance companys liabilities in specified, stressed financial conditions, or by applying fixed percentages to the insurance companys liabilities and risk exposures.
The requirements in the different jurisdictions in which the group operates are detailed below: Group regulatory basis The group is required to comply with the Solvency II capital requirements using a Partial Internal Model.
The vast majority of the risk to which the group is exposed is assessed on the Internal Model basis approved by the PRA.
The group capital requirements for a handful of smaller entities are assessed using the Standard Formula basis on materiality grounds.
The groups capital requirements in respect of its US insurance businesses are valued on a local statutory basis, following PRA approval of the groups application to use the Deduction and Aggregation method of including these businesses in the group solvency calculation.
UK regulatory basis At the balance sheet date, required capital for the life business was based on the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA.
All material EEA insurance firms, including Legal & General Assurance Society Limited, Legal & General Insurance Limited, and Legal & General Assurance Pensions Management Limited LGIMs insurance subsidiary are required to hold eligible own funds in excess of their Solvency Capital Requirement SCR, calculated on an Internal Model basis.
These firms as well as the non-EEA insurance firm Legal & General Reinsurance Company Limited based in Bermuda contribute over 90% of the groups SCR.
US regulatory basis Required capital is determined to be the Company Action Level Risk Based Capital RBC based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners RBC model.
RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, taking into account its size and risk profile.
The calculation is based on applying factors to various asset, premium, claims, expense and reserve items, with higher factors used for those items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items.
Dutch regulatory basis Legal & General Netherlands is required to manage its capital on a Solvency II basis.
On a Solvency II basis the SCR is calculated using the standard formula approach.
The group has announced the disposal of Legal & General Netherlands, subject to regulatory approval.
Bermudan regulatory basis Bermudan regulated insurers are required to hold sufficient capital to meet 120% of the Bermudan Solvency Capital Requirement BSCR.
The BSCR model follows a standard formula framework: capital attributed to each risk is calculated by applying capital factors to the assets and liabilities.
The individual risk elements excluding operational risk are combined using a covariance matrix and then added to an operational risk charge.
