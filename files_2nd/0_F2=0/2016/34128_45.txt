ESOS was enforced by the Environment Agency EA and involved the audit of four representative stores from our portfolio.
We assessed future energy savings, other than the technologies that we had already programmed and invested in.
We completed the audits in November 2015, before the December deadline, and have considered changes to our future budget for investing in viable energy saving technologies as a result.
