Annual report and financial statements 2015 16 77 4 Interests in other entities continued 4.4 Business combinations 52 weeks ended 31 January 2016 On 7 December 2015, Wm Morrison Produce Limited exercised an option to acquire the remaining 49% of the issued share capital of Wm Morrison Bananas Limited from Global Pacific Group, for a cash consideration of 3m.
Due to the existence of the put and call option, the Group had previously treated Wm Morrison Bananas Limited as a 100% subsidiary.
For part of the year the Group was part of a joint venture in respect of The Morrisons Farm at Dumfries House Limited the Farm.
The Group terminated this agreement on 13 November 2015 when Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC acquired the remaining 50% of the issued share capital of the Farm.
On 6 January 2016, the Farm was renamed Neerock Farming Limited.
The Farms results are immaterial to the Group.
52 weeks ended 1 February 2015 In the 52 weeks ended 1 February 2015 there were no business combinations.
4.5 Disposals of businesses 52 weeks ended 31 January 2016 On 26 October 2015, the Group disposed of its subsidiary Wm Morrison Convenience Stores Limited and associated assets to MLCG Limited for cash consideration of 20m.
This resulted in a loss on disposal of 34m.
This loss is one-off in nature and therefore has been excluded from reported underlying earnings.
Following the sale, the Group continues to guarantee leases relating to its former convenience stores.
The Group has made an assessment of the likelihood and amount of future rental commitments should these leases revert, and recognised a liability on the balance sheet at 31 January 2016 reflecting the estimated cash outflow.
In the event of lessee default the Group will look to minimise its liability by finding alternative occupiers as soon as possible.
52 weeks ended 1 February 2015 On 11 July 2014, the Group disposed of Kiddicare.
com Limited to Endless LLP receiving a consideration of 2m for the sale of the shares.
This resulted in a profit on disposal of 4m following an impairment charge in the 52 weeks ended 2 February 2014.
Only one of the ten leases relating to Kiddicare remains unassigned.
5 Working capital and provisions 5.1 Accounting policies Stock Stock represents goods for resale and is measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Cost is calculated on a weighted average basis and comprises purchase price, import duties and other non-recoverable taxes, reduced by promotional funding and commercial income and a provision for estimated losses relating to shrinkage and markdowns.
Losses relating to shrinkage in stores are based on historical losses verified by physical stock counts conducted by an independent third party.
Provision is made for obsolete and slow moving items.
Trade and other debtors Trade and other debtors are initially recognised at fair value, which is generally equal to face value, and subsequently held at amortised cost.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full, with the charge being included in administrative expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents for cash flow purposes includes cash-in-hand, cash-at-bank and bank overdrafts.
In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts that do not have right of offset are presented within current liabilities.
Cash held by the Groups captive insurer, Farock Insurance Company Limited, is not available for use by the rest of the Group as it is restricted for use against the specific liability of the captive.
As the funds are available on demand, they meet the definition of cash in IAS 7 Cash flow statements.
Trade and other creditors Trade and other creditors are initially recognised at fair value, which is generally equal to face value of the invoices received, and subsequently held at amortised cost.
Trade creditors are presented net of commercial income due when the Groups trading terms state that income from suppliers will be netted against amounts owing to that supplier.
Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Financial statements 78 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 31 January 2016 5 Working capital and provisions continued 5.1 Accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are created where the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, where it is probable that it will result in an outflow of economic benefits to settle the obligation, and where it can be reliably measured.
For petrol filling station decommissioning costs this is when the filling station is first constructed and for dilapidations on leased buildings, when the lease is entered into.
Provisions for onerous leases are recognised when the Group believes that the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under the lease.
The amounts provided are based on the Groups best estimate of the least net cost of exit.
Where material, these estimated outflows are discounted to net present value using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assumptions.
The unwinding of this discount is recognised as a financing cost in the income statement.
