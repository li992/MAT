Annual report and financial statements 2015 16 41 For the revenue targets, as set out in the Directors Remuneration Policy, the Committee will retain the discretion to adjust the targets in the event of material disposals or store closures during the performance period which were not taken into account in setting the target range.
For the avoidance of doubt, the revenue targets in the table above exclude convenience stores.
The Committee has discretion to adjust these calculations for material exceptional events or actions which may include strategic changes to capital expenditure approved by the Board and material acquisitions or disposals which were not in the contemplation of the Committee at the time the targets were set and which might otherwise materially distort the outcome, in order to ensure that vesting of the LTIP is an accurate and fair reflection of performance.
If the Committee exercises its discretion to amend the calculation, a full disclosure of the reason for the amendment and an explanation of the impact will be given in the relevant Annual report on remuneration.

Under the guidelines, Executive Directors are expected to retain 50% of vested share awards net of tax, including shares from the deferred element of the annual bonus, until the guideline is reached.
Shares held under the DSBP calculated on a post-tax basis which are subject only to a continuing service requirement, will be included in assessing the level of shareholding.
The shareholding guideline should be reached within five years of appointment to the Board.
The Company has share ownership guidelines for Non-Executive Directors of 50% of base fees.
This guideline should be reached within three years of appointment to the Board or three years after the date of adoption of the policy for incumbent Directors.

David Potts and Trevor Strain do not yet meet the 200% shareholding guideline but are both within the five year period allowed to build up their shareholding.
