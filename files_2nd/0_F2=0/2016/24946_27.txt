2 During 2016, HSBC Holdings issued $2,000m of perpetual subordinated contingent convertible capital securities, after issuance costs of $6m and tax benefits of $4m.
In 2015, HSBC Holdings issued $2,450m and 1,000m of perpetual subordinated contingent convertible capital securities, on which there were $12m of external issuance costs, $25m of intra-group issuance costs and $19m of tax.
In 2014, HSBC Holdings issued $2,250m, $1,500m and 1,500m of perpetual subordinated contingent convertible capital securities, on which there were $13m of external issuance costs and $33m of intra-group issuance costs.
Under IFRSs these issuance costs and tax benefits are classified as equity.
The increase principally reflects the share buy-back initiative, with the purchase of 325,273,407 ordinary shares to reduce outstanding ordinary shares.
In addition, treasury shares are also held within HSBCs Insurance business retirement funds for the benefit of policyholders or beneficiaries within employee trusts for the settlement of shares expected to be delivered under employee share schemes or bonus plans, and the market-making activities in Markets.
4 Cumulative goodwill amounting to $5,138m has been charged against reserves in respect of acquisitions of subsidiaries prior to 1January 1998, including $3,469m charged against the merger reserve arising on the acquisition of HSBC Bank plc.
The balance of$1,669m has been charged against retained earnings.
5 At 31 December 2015, our operations in Brazil were classified as held for sale see Note 22.
The cumulative amount of other reserves attributable to these operations were as follows: available-for-sale fair value reserve debit of $176m, cash flow hedging reserve credit of $34m and foreign exchange reserve debit of $2.6bn.
6 Statutory share premium relief under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 the Act was taken in respect of the acquisition of HSBC Bank plc in 1992, HSBC France in 2000 and HSBC Finance Corporation in 2003, and the shares issued were recorded at their nominal value only.
In HSBCs consolidated financial statements the fair value differences of $8,290m in respect of HSBC France and $12,768m in respect of HSBC Finance Corporation were recognised in the merger reserve.
The merger reserve created on theacquisition of HSBC Finance Corporation subsequently became attached to HSBC Overseas Holdings UK Limited HOHU, following a number of intra-group reorganisations.
During 2009, pursuant to Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985, statutory share premium relief was taken in respect of the rights issue and $15,796m was recognised in the merger reserve.
The merger reserve includes a deduction of $614m in respect ofcosts relating to the rights issue, of which $149m was subsequently transferred to the income statement.
Of this $149m, $121m was a loss arising from accounting for the agreement with the underwriters as a contingent forward contract.
The merger reserve excludes the loss of $344m on a forward foreign exchange contract associated with hedging the proceeds of the rights issue.
