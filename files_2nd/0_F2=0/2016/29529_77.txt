PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES Accounting policy The Group recognises a provision for a present legal or constructive obligation resulting from a past event when it is more likely than not that it will be required to transfer economic benefits to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Where a liability arises based on participation in a market at a specified date, the obligation is recognised in the financial statements on that date and is not accrued over the period.
Significant accounting estimates and judgements The recognition and measurement of provisions for liabilities and charges requires significant judgement and the use of estimates about uncertain future conditions or events.
