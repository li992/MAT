The directors expect that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The key assumptions concerning the future, key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements at the statement of financial position date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS Functional currency The UAE Dirham is determined to be the functional currency of the Company.
Judgement has been used to determine the functional currency of the Company that most appropriately represents the economic effects of the Companys transactions, events and conditions.
As part of this assessment, the following information has been taken into account: The primary economic environment influencing the Companys income dividends is the UAE and the effect of the local environment is limited to expenses incurred within the UK.
The ability of the Company to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent on the economy of, and the operation of its subsidiaries in, the UAE.

NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS The Company applied for the first time certain standards and amendments which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
The new standards, amendments to IFRS, which are effective as of 1 January 2016, are listed below, have no impact on the Company.
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: Accounting for Acquisition of Interests Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 Agriculture: Bearer Plants Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements Annual Improvements 2012-2014 Cycle IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures iii.
Applicability of the amendments to IFRS 7 to condensed interim financial statements IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception 2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES Subsidiaries are entities which are controlled by the Company.
Control is achieved when the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Specifically, the Company controls an investee if, and only if, the Company has: Power over the investee i. e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee.
Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee.
The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment.
When the Company incurs increases in or return of share capital, to from its subsidiaries, such movements are recognised within the cost of investment in subsidiaries.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.
Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the investment in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties.
When this information is not available the fair value is determined based on the net present value of the future cash flows related to its subsidiaries, using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount.
Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period as to whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made.
An impairment loss is reversed to the income statement to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Acquisition of subsidiary under common control When the Company acquires a subsidiary under common control, the cost of the investment is deemed to be the Companys share of the net assets of the subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consists of cash in hand and bank balances.
EQUITY The Company has issued ordinary shares that are classified as equity.
The difference between the issue price and the par value of ordinary share capital is allocated to share premium.
The transaction costs incurred for the share issue are accounted for as a deduction from share premium, net of any related income tax benefit, to the extent they are incremental costs directly attributable to the share issue that would otherwise have been avoided.
148 NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 1.
Financial Statements 2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUALS Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods and services received whether billed by the supplier or not.
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer.
If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Accounts payable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
PROVISIONS Provisions are recognised when the Company has an obligation legal or constructive arising from a past event, and the costs to settle the obligation are both probable and able to be reliably measured.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the obligation.
Increases in provisions due to the passage of time are recognised in the income statement.
SHARE BASED PAYMENTS Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set out in note 12.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves other payables.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions for which vesting are conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition.
These are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and or service conditions are satisfied.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in UAE Dirhams at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS An assessment is made at each statement of financial position date to determine whether there is objective evidence that a specific financial asset may be impaired.
If such evidence exists, any impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment is determined as the difference between carrying value and the present value of future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.
FINANCIAL GUARANTEE CONTRACTS Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee.
Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date and the amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.
DIVIDEND INCOME Revenue is recognised when the Companys right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend.
NMC Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 149 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued At 31 December 2016 3 ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS ISSUED BUT NOT EFFECTIVE The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Companys financial statements are disclosed below.
The Company intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective.
IFRS 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a new five-step model that will apply to revenue arising from contracts with customers.
Under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.
The principles in IFRS 15 provide a more structured approach to measuring and recognising revenue.
The new revenue standard is applicable to all entities and will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS.
Either a full or modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15 and plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date.
IFRS 16 LEASES IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016, and specifies how an IFRS reporter will recognise, measure, present and disclose leases.
The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value.
Lessors continue to classify leases as operating or finance, with IFRS 16s approach to lessor accounting substantially unchanged from its predecessor, IAS 17.
IFRS 16 applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 16 and plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date.
In addition, the standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Companys financial statements that are not expected to have any material impact on the Company are as follows: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 7 IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses Amendments to IAS 12 IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions Amendments to IFRS 2 4 INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARY 2016 2015 US$000 US$000 As at 1 January and 31 December 204,127 204,127 This represents the cost of the investment in NMC Healthcare LLC previous parent company, a wholly owned subsidiary held through the holding company subsidiaries NMC Health Holdco Limited and NMC Holding Co LLC.

Fair values are determined using the Black-Scholes model.

CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument, leading to a financial loss.
The Companys credit risk arises from amounts due from a related party and bank balances.

LIQUIDITY RISK The Companys objective is to maintain sufficient funding to meet its obligations as they fall due.
The table below analyses the Companys undiscounted financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the contractual payment dates.
Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.
