less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are generally no greater than eight years.

In addition, impairment tests for all assets are performed when there is an indication of impairment.
If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the income statement so as to reduce the carrying amount in the balance sheet to its recoverable amount.
Previously impaired assets excluding goodwill are reviewed for possible reversal of previous impairment at each reporting date.
Impairment reversal cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU.
There were no material reversals of impairment in the current or prior year.
How recoverable amount is calculated The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less cost of disposal FVLCD and value in use VIU.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units CGUs.
Valuation methods Fair value less cost of disposal FVLCD is an estimate of the amount that a market participant would pay for an asset or CGU, less the cost of disposal.
Fair value for mineral and petroleum assets is generally determined using independent market assumptions to calculate the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset, including the anticipated cash flow effects of any capital expenditure to enhance production or reduce cost, and its eventual disposal where a market participant may take a consistent view.
Cash flows are discounted using an appropriate post-tax market discount rate to arrive at a net present value of the asset which is compared against the assets carrying value.
