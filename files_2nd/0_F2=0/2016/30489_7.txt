Onerous lease provision relates to sites which have been closed and made available for sale.
A provision has been raised to cover the rental costs for the estimated period required to dispose of the sites.
Other property losses The onerous lease provision relates to pubs for which future trading profits, or income from subleases, are not expected to cover the rent.
The provision takes several factors into account, including the expected future profitability of the pub and also the amount estimated as payable on surrender of the lease, where this is a likely outcome.
In the year, 28,000 2015: 1,858,000 was charged net in respect of onerous leases.
Property impairment relates to the situation in which, owing to poor trading performance, pubs are unlikely to generate sufficient cash in the future to justify their current book value.

Income tax expense continued b Reconciliation of the total tax charge The tax expense after exceptional items in the income statement for the year is higher 2015: higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 20.0% 2015: 20.7%, owing largely to less expenditure qualifying for capital allowances.
On 18 November 2015, the UK corporate tax rate of 18% for 1 April 2020 onwards was substantively enacted.
As a result, the deferred tax liability which predominantly unwinds in periods on or after 1 April 2020 has been remeasured from 20% to 18%.
This has resulted in a one-off credit of 8,363,000.

Assumptions are used about sales, costs and profit, using a pre-tax discount rate for future years of 8% 2015: 8%.
If the value, based on the higher of future anticipated cash flows and fair value, is lower than the book value, the difference is written off as property impairment.
As a result of this exercise, a net impairment loss of 4,809,000 2015: 10,705,000 was charged to property losses in the income statement, as described in note 3.
Management believes that a reasonable change in any of the key assumptions, for example the discount rate applied to each pub, could cause the carrying value of the pub to exceed its recoverable amount, but that the change would be immaterial.

Capital risk management The companys capital structure comprises shareholders equity and loans.

The company measures loans using a ratio of net debt to EBITDA which was 3.47 times 2015: 3.37 times at the year end.
Section 2, on page 44, discusses the financial risks associated with financial instruments, including credit risk and liquidity risk.
Obligations under finance leases The minimum lease payments under finance leases fall due as follows: 2016 2015 000 000 Within one year 2,101 In the second to fifth year, inclusive 2,101 Less future finance charges 50 Present value of lease obligations 2,051 Less amount due for settlement within one year 2,051 Amount due for settlement during the second to fifth year, inclusive All finance lease obligations are in respect of various equipment and software used in the business.
