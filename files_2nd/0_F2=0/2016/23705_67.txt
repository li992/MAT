Fair value methodology Information in respect of the fair value of borrowings is included in note 25 a.
There are no material differences between the carrying value of the Groups other financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value and their estimated fair values.
The following assumptions and methods are used to estimate the fair values: the fair values of receivables, payables and cash and cash equivalents are considered to approximate to the carrying amounts: the fair values of short-term borrowings, other than bonds, are considered to approximate to the carrying amounts due to the short maturity terms of such instruments: the fair value of that portion of bonds carried at amortised cost is based on quoted market prices, employing a valuation falling within Level 1 of the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy: the fair values of long-term floating rate bank loans and finance lease obligations are considered to approximate to the carrying amount: and the fair values of other financial assets and liabilities are calculated based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using a valuation methodology falling within Level 2 of the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.
