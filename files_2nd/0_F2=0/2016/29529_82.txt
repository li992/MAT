Securities which carry a discretionary coupon and have no fixed maturity or redemption date are classified as other equity instruments.
Interest payments on these securities are recognised, net of tax, as distributions from equity in the period in which they are paid.
Where the Company or other members of the consolidated Group purchase the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from the total shareholders equity of the Group and or of the Company as treasury shares until they are cancelled.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders equity of the Group and or the Company.

SHARE CAPITAL, OTHER EQUITY AND RESERVES continued Reserves The constituents of the reserves are summarised as follows: Capital Reserve represents the exchange difference on redenomination of share capital and share premium from sterling to US dollars in 2001.
The capital redemption reserve represents the nominal value of preference shares redeemed Merger reserve represents the premium arising on shares issued using a cash box financing structure, which required the Company to create a merger reserve under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
Shares were issued using this structure in 2005 and 2006 to assist in the funding of certain acquisitions, in 2008, 2010 and 2015 for the shares issued by way of a rights issue, and for the shares issued in 2009 in the placing.
The funding raised by the 2008 and 2010 rights issues and 2009 share issue was fully retained within the Company.
Of the 2015 funding, $1.5 billion was used to subscribe to additional equity in Standard Chartered Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Own credit adjustment reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss relating to own credit.
Following the Groups decision to early apply this IFRS 9 requirement the cumulative own credit adjustment component of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss has been transferred from opening retained earnings to the OCA reserve.
Gains and losses on financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss relating to own credit in the year have been taken through other comprehensive income into this reserve.
On derecognition of applicable instruments the balance of any OCA will not be recycled to the income statement, but will be transferred within equity to retained earnings Available-for-sale reserve represents the unrealised fair value gains and losses in respect of financial assets classified as available-for-sale, net of taxation.
Gains and losses are deferred in this reserve and are reclassified to the income statement when the underlying asset is sold, matures or becomes impaired Cash flow hedge reserve represents the effective portion of the gains and losses on derivatives that meet the criteria for these types of hedges.
Gains and losses are deferred in this reserve and are reclassified to the income statement when the underlying hedged item affects profit or loss or when a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur Translation reserve represents the cumulative foreign exchange gains and losses on translation of the net investment of the Group in foreign operations.
Since 1 January 2004, gains and losses are deferred to this reserve and are reclassified to the income statement when the underlying foreign operation is disposed.
Gains and losses arising from derivatives used as hedges of net investments are netted against the foreign exchange gains and losses on translation of the net investment of the foreign operations Retained earnings represents profits and other comprehensive income earned by the Group and Company in the current and prior periods, together with the after tax increase relating to equity-settled share options, less dividend distributions and own shares held treasury shares A substantial part of the Groups reserves are held in overseas subsidiary undertakings and branches, principally to support local operations or to comply with local regulations.
The maintenance of local regulatory capital ratios could potentially restrict the amount of reserves which can be remitted.
In addition, if these overseas reserves were to be remitted, further unprovided taxation liabilities might arise.
As at 31 December 2016, the distributable reserves of Standard Chartered PLC the Company were $15.2 billion 2015: $15.2 billion.
These comprised retained earnings and $12.5 billion of the merger reserve account.
Distribution of reserves is subject to maintaining minimum capital requirements.
The cumulative amount of goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiary and associated undertakings written off against Group reserves since 1973 is $27 million 2015: $27 million.
