On 19 April 2006, the Group acquired the remaining 58% of the shares of the UK business that were not already owned by the Group.
As a result the Group fully consolidated the UK business from that date.
The acquisition was accounted for through the purchase method and as a consequence the entire assets and liabilities of the UK business were revalued to fair value.
The effect of these adjustments on the 42% of the UK business already owned was reflected in the revaluation reserve.
On 14 October 2008, Regus plc acquired the entire share capital of Regus Group plc in exchange for the issue of new shares of Regus plc on the basis of one share in Regus plc for one share held previously in Regus Group plc.
At the date of the transaction, Regus plc had nominal assets and liabilities and therefore the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of Regus plc by Regus Group plc.
Consequently, no fair value acquisition adjustments were required and the aggregate of the Group reserves have been attributed to Regus plc.
On 19 December 2016, under a Scheme of Arrangement between Regus plc, the former holding company of the Group, and its shareholders, under Article 125 of the Companies Jersey Law 1991, and as sanctioned by The Royal Court of Jersey, all the issued shares in Regus plc were cancelled and an equivalent number of new shares in Regus plc were issued to IWG plc in consideration for the allotment to shareholders of one ordinary share in IWG plc for each ordinary share in Regus plc that they held on the record date 18 December 2016.
The establishment of IWG plc as the new parent company was accounted for as a common control transaction under IFRS.

IFRSs not yet effective Except for IFRS 16 Leases, the following new or amended standards and interpretations that are mandatory for 2017 annual periods and future years are not expected to have a material impact on the Company: IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative Amendments to IAS 7 1 January 2017 IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised losses Amendments to IAS 12 1 January 2017 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 The adoption of IFRS 16 will result in the recognition of a significant right-of-use asset together with corresponding lease liabilities.
The Group is in the process of quantifying the related impact.
The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has the rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences.
The results are consolidated until the date control ceases or the subsidiary qualifies as a disposal group, at which point the assets and liabilities are carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value.
Impairment of non-financial assets For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount was estimated at 30 September 2016.
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of these assets to determine whether there is an indicator of impairment.
If any indicator is identified then the assets recoverable amount is re-evaluated.
The carrying amount of the Groups other non-financial assets other than deferred tax assets are reviewed at the reporting date to determine whether there is an indicator of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
The Group has identified individual business centres as the CGU.
We evaluate the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment at the centre CGU level where there are indicators of impairment.
Centres CGUs are grouped by country of operation for the purposes of carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill as this is the lowest level at which it can be assessed.
Individual fittings and equipment in our centres or elsewhere in the business that become obsolete or are damaged are assessed and impaired where appropriate.

The effect of these adjustments on the Goodwill 42% of the UK business already owned was reflected in the revaluation reserve.
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous On 14 October 2008, Regus plc acquired the entire share capital of Regus Group plc in exchange for the issue of new shares of Regus plc interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Available-for-sale financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses and foreign currency differences on debt instruments, are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the fair value reserve.
When these assets are derecognised, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.

An operating segments results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker the Board of Directors of the Group to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
The business is run on a worldwide basis but managed through four principal geographical segments: Americas: Europe, Middle East and Africa EMEA : Asia Pacific: and the United Kingdom.
These geographical segments exclude the Groups non-trading, holding and corporate management companies.
The results of business centres in each of these regions form the basis for reporting geographical results to the chief operating decision maker.
All reportable segments are involved in the provision of global workplace solutions.
The Groups reportable segments operate in different markets and are managed separately because of the different economic characteristics that exist in each of those markets.
Each reportable segment has its own discrete senior management team responsible for the performance of the segment.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the Annual Report and Accounts for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The performance of each segment is assessed on the basis of the segment operating profit, which excludes internal revenue, corporate overheads and foreign exchange gains and losses arising on transactions with other operating segments.

The investment in growth is funded by a combination of cash flow generated from the Groups mature business centres and debt.
The Group has a 550.0m revolving credit facility provided by a group of relationship banks with a final maturity extended until 2021, with a further option to extend to 2023.
As at 31 December 2016, 299.4m was available and undrawn.

Credit risk Credit risk could occur where a customer or counterparty defaults under the contractual terms of a financial instrument and arises principally in relation to customer contracts and the Groups cash deposits.
A diversified customer base, requirement for customer deposits, and payments in advance on workstation contracts minimise the Groups exposure to customer credit risk.
No single customer contributes a material percentage of the Groups revenue.
The Groups policy is to provide against trade receivables when specific debts are judged to be irrecoverable or where formal recovery procedures have commenced.
A provision is created where debts are more than three months overdue which reflects the Groups historical experience of the likelihood of recoverability of these trade receivables.
These provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assess changes in the likelihood of recoverability.

Share-based payments continued Measurement of fair values The fair value of the rights granted through the employee share purchase plan was measured based on the Monte Carlo simulation.
The CIP Matching Shares and Share Option Plan awards made in 2008 and 2009 did not have performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the date of the award.
A valuation was performed for those awards based on the terms that applied to similar awards made in previous years.
The Remuneration Committee set the performance conditions for the awards made in 2008 and 2009 effective from 22 March 2010 and the valuation of these awards was updated in the year ended 31 December 2010.
It is recognised by the Remuneration Committee that the additional EPS targets represent a highly challenging goal and consequently, in determining whether they have been met, the Committee will exercise its discretion.
The overall aim is that the relevant EPS targets must have been met on a run-rate or underlying basis.
As such, an adjusted measure of EPS will be calculated to assess the underlying performance of the business.
While the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to adjust EPS as it sees fit at the time, by way of example, the following adjustments may be considered for the 2008 and 2009 grants:  In a fast-growing company such as IWG, costs are necessarily incurred in one year to drive profits in future years.
Thus it is important to ensure management is not incentivised to cut back on these investments to meet EPS targets in any one year.
Accordingly, those costs, incurred in the vesting year, which it considers necessary to drive future growth, will be excluded from the EPS calculation.
These would include, inter alia, the costs of the business development departments, excess marketing expenditures and current year losses from investing in new locations:  Any one-off or non-recurring costs will be excluded:  It is expected that in the relevant periods the cash tax rate will rise as cumulative tax losses are utilised, thereby increasing progressively the challenge of achieving a 14p EPS target.
This will then be further complicated by the need to recognise deferred tax assets as the business strengthens, reducing the accounting rate of tax in one year and increasing it in the next.
To provide greater clarity and incentive to management, EPS will be calculated based upon the cash tax rate up to a maximum of 30%: and  The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the EPS and performance targets are a transparent and accurate measure of the Companys performance at this time and are the key corporate metrics for driving long-term shareholder value.
In addition, the TSR condition will ensure that executives are encouraged to focus on ensuring that the Companys return to shareholders is competitive compared to comparable companies.

Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these accounts The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain judgements and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
Fair value accounting for business combinations For each business combination, we assess the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired.
Where there is not an active market in the category of the non-current assets typically acquired with a business centre or where the books and records of the acquired company do not provide sufficient information to derive an accurate valuation, management calculates an estimated fair value based on available information and experience.
The main categories of acquired non-current assets where managements judgement has an impact on the amounts recorded include tangible fixed assets, customer list intangibles and the fair market value of leasehold assets and liabilities.
For significant business combinations management also obtains third-party valuations to provide additional guidance as to the appropriate valuation to be included in the financial statements.
Valuation of intangibles and goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset.
We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill based on our CGUs aggregated at a country level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections which assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur.
We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the asset is less than its estimated recoverable amount.
Further details of the methodology and assumptions applied to the impairment review in the year ended 31 December 2016, including the sensitivity to changes in those assumptions, can be found in note 12.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment We evaluate the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment at a centre CGU level where there are indicators of impairment at the balance sheet date.
In the assessment of value-in-use, key judgemental areas in determining future cash flow projections include: an assessment of the location of the centre: the local economic situation: competition: local environmental factors: the management of the centre: and future changes in occupancy, revenue and costs of the centre.
Tax assets and liabilities We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes.
Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time.
Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates.
It is current Group policy to recognise a deferred tax asset when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be used.
The Group considers it probable if the entity has made a taxable profit in the previous year and is forecast to continue to make a profit in the foreseeable future.
Where appropriate, the Group assesses the potential risk of future tax liabilities arising from the operation of its business in multiple tax jurisdictions and includes provisions within tax liabilities for those risks that can be estimated reliably.
Changes in existing tax laws can affect large international groups similar to IWG and could result in significant additional tax liabilities over and above those already provided for.
Onerous lease provisions We have identified certain poor performing centres where the lease is considered onerous, i. e. the Group does not expect to recover the unavoidable lease costs up to the first break point.
The accounts include a provision for our estimate of the net amounts payable under the terms of the lease to the first break point, discounted at the Group weighted average cost of capital, where appropriate.
Dilapidations Certain of our leases with landlords include a clause obliging the Group to hand the property back in the condition as at the date of signing the lease.
The costs to bring the property back to that condition are not known until the Group exits the property so the Group estimates the costs at each balance sheet date.
However, given that landlords often regard the nature of changes made to properties as improvements, the Group estimates that it is unlikely that any material dilapidation payments will be necessary.
Consequently, provision has been made only for those potential dilapidation payments when it is probable that an outflow will occur and can be reliably estimated.
