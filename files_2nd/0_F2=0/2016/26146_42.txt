The impact of the adoption is shown in note 10.
Going concern The directors have made enquiries and have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Fixed asset investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included in the balance sheet at cost less any provision for impairment.
Taxation Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The deferred tax provision is based on theexpected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which theasset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
145 Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial Statements Notes to the Company financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2016 continued 1 Accounting policies continued Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The principal financial assets and liabilities of the Company are as follows: a Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, including bank deposits with original maturities of three months or less, net of bank overdrafts where legal right of set off exists.
Bank overdrafts are included within financial liabilities in current liabilities in the balance sheet.
b Bank and other borrowings Interest-bearing bank and other borrowings are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis inthe income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying value of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
c Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured in future periods at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting change in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and whether the hedging relationship is effective.
For cash flow hedges the effective part of the change in fair value of these derivatives is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to theincome statement in the periods when the hedged items will affect profit orloss.
The fair value of interest rate derivatives is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the derivatives at the balance sheet date.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity remains there until the forecast transaction occurs.
The Company enters into forward contracts in order to hedge against transactional foreign currency exposures.
In cases where these derivative instruments are significant, hedge accounting is applied as described above.
Where hedge accounting is not applied, changes in fair value of derivatives are recognised in the income statement.
Fair values are based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments Share-based payments granted but not vested are valued at the fair value of the shares at the date of grant.
This affects the Sharesave and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP schemes.
The fair value of these schemes at the date of award is calculated using the Black-Scholes model apart from the total shareholder return element of the LTIP which is based on a stochastic model.
The cost to the Company of awards to employees under the LTIP scheme is spread on a straight-line basis over the relevant performance period.
The scheme awards to senior employees a number of shares which will vest after three years if particular criteriaare met.
The cost of the scheme is based on the fair value of the shares at the date the options are granted.
Shares purchased and held in trust in connection with the Companys share schemes are deducted from retained earnings.
No gain orloss is recognised within the income statement on the market value of these shares compared with the original cost.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Company accounting policies which are described above, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Theestimates are based on historical experience and the factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from those estimates.
The estimates are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimateis revised.
There are no critical judgements, apart from those involving estimates, that the directors have made in the process of applying theCompanys accounting policies and that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
They key assumptions and a key source of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that has a significant risk of carrying amaterial adjustment to the carrying amount within the next financial year is: Impairment of investment in subsidiaries Determining whether the Companys investments in subsidiaries have been impaired requires estimations of the investments value inuse.
The value in use calculations require the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from investments.
The carrying amount of the investment in subsidiaries at the balance sheet date was 170.9m 2015: 165.3m.
No impairment losses have been recognised.
