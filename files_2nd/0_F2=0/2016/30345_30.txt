Vesuvius plc 114 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
General Information Vesuvius plc Vesuvius or the Company is a public limited company registered in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Company and its subsidiary and joint venture companies theGroup is set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to59 and its registered address is shown on page 162.
Basis of Preparation 2.1 Basis of accounting The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and, with the exception of fide ned bene t pension plans, certain provisions, available-for-sale investments and derivative financial instruments, under the historical cost convention.
2.2 Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control exists when the Company has the power to direct the relevant activities of an entity that signi cantly affect the entitys return so as to have rights to the variable return from its activities.
In assessing whether control exists, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are taken into account.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Group income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those detailed herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identi ed separately from the Groups interest therein.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination together with the non-controlling interests share of pro t or loss, each component of other comprehensive income, and dividends paid since the date of the combination.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a fide cit balance.
2.3 Going concern The Directors have prepared cash ow forecasts for the Group for a period in excess of 12 months from the date of approval of the 2016 financial statements.
These forecasts re ect an assessment of current and future end-market conditions and their impact on the Groups future trading performance.
The forecasts show that the Group will be able to operate within the current committed debt facilities and show continued compliance with the Companys financial covenants.
On the basis of the exercise described above and the Groups available committed debt facilities, the Directors consider that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt a going concern basis inpreparing the financial statements of the Group and the Company.
2.4 Functional and presentation currency The financial statements are presented in millions of pound sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and rounded toone decimal place.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 27.1.
2.5 Disclosure of separately reported items IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements provides no fide nitive guidance as to the format of the income statement, but states key lines which should be disclosed.
It also encourages the disclosure of additional line items and the reordering of items presented on the face of the income statement when appropriate for a proper understanding of the entitys financial performance.
In accordance with IAS 1, the Company has adopted a columnar presentation for its Group income statement, to separately identify headline performance results, as the Directors consider that this gives a better view of the underlying results of the ongoing business.
As part of this presentation format, the Company has adopted a policy of disclosing separately on the face of its Group income statement, within the column entitled Separately reported items, the effect of any components of financial performance for which the Directors consider separate disclosure would assist both in a better understanding of the financial performance achieved and in making projections of future results.
In its adoption of this policy, the Company applies an even-handed approach to both gains and losses and aims to be both consistent and clear in its accounting and disclosure of such items.
Both materiality and the nature and function of the components of income and expense are considered in deciding upon such presentation.
Such items may include, inter alia, the financial effect of exceptional items which occur infrequently, such as major restructuring activity, initial recognition and subsequent increase, decrease and amortisation of US deferred tax assets, together with items always reported separately, such as amortisation charges relating to acquired intangible assets, pro ts or losses arising on the disposal of continuing or discontinued operations and the taxation impact of the aforementioned exceptional items and items reported separately.
Basis of Preparation continued 2.6 New and revised IFRS IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective after 1 January 2018, for the year ending 2018, replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classi cation and measurement of financial instruments, including a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and new general hedge accounting requirements.
It also carries forward the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments from IAS 39.
Based on an assessment of the adoption of IFRS 9, the Group does not believe there will be a signi cant impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective after 1 January 2018, for the year ending 2018 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.
It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes.
Based on an assessment of the adoption of IFRS 15, the Group does not believe there will be a signi cant impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
IFRS 16 Leases effective after 1 January 2019, for the year ending 2019, replaces the existing guidance in IAS 17 Leases.
IFRS 16 provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value.
The Group is currently assessing the potential impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements resulting from the application of IFRS 16.
Other new or amended standards are not expected to have a signi cant impact on the Groups financial statements.
Accounting Policies and Critical Judgements Determining the carrying amount of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effect of uncertain future events.
The major sources of estimation uncertainty that have a signi cant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities are noted below.
3.1 Goodwill and other intangible assets The Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill and other capitalised intangible assets have a value that will bene t the performance of the Group over future periods.
To assist in making this judgement, the Directors undertake an assessment, at least annually, of the carrying value of the Groups capitalised goodwill and other intangible assets.
In the assessment undertaken as at 31December 2016, further details of which are given in Note 17, value in use was derived from discounted three-year cash ow projections and terminal value based on a growth rate of 2.5% in the years beyond the projection period.
The projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of the Groups businesses for this purpose.
Changes to the assumptions used in making these forecasts could signi cantly alter the Directors assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets.
3.2 Employee bene ts The Groups financial statements include the costs and obligations associated with the provision of pension and other post-retirement bene ts to current and former employees.
It is the Directors responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining the key elements of the costs of meeting such future obligations.
These assumptions are set after consultation with the Groups actuaries and include those used to determine regular service costs and the nancing elements related to the plans assets and liabilities.
Whilst the Directors believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used could affect the Groups pro t and financial position.
3.3 Provisions Vesuvius has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Several of the Groups subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations ofthe company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities.
Provisions are made for the expected amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing and amount of the associated out ows is subject to some uncertainty.
The Directors use their judgement and experience to make provisions in the financial statements for an appropriate amount relating to such matters.
Vesuvius plc 116 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Accounting Policies and Critical Judgements continued 3.4 Taxation a Current tax Tax bene ts are not recognised unless it is probable that they will result in future economic bene ts to the Group.
In assessing the amount of the bene t to be recognised in the financial statements, the Directors exercise their judgement in considering the effect of negotiations, litigation and any other matters that they consider may impact upon the potential settlement.
Any interest and penalties on tax liabilities are provided for in the tax charge.
The Group operates internationally and is subject to tax in many different jurisdictions.
As a consequence, the Group is routinely subject to tax audits and local enquiries which, by their very nature, can take a considerable period of time to conclude.
Provisions are made for known issues based on all substantively enacted legislation, the Directors interpretation of country-speci c tax law and their assessment of the likely outcome.
All income tax liabilities, provisions and assets are treated as income tax payable and recoverable in accordance with IAS 12. b Deferred tax The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised losses and other timing differences arising in a number of the Groups businesses, further details of which are given in Note 10.4.
Account has been taken of future forecasts of taxable pro t in arriving at the values at which these assets are recognised.
Ifthese forecast pro ts do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which the losses or timing differences might be recognised, then the value of deferred tax assets will need to be revised in a future period.
The Group also has losses and other timing differences, analysed in Note 10.4, for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised in these financial statements, relating either to loss-making subsidiaries where the future economic bene t of the timing difference is not probable or to where the timing difference is of such a nature that its value is dependent on certain types of pro t being earned, such as capital pro ts.
If trading or other appropriate pro ts are earned in future in these companies, these losses and other timing differences may yield bene t to the Group in the form of a reduced tax charge.
Alternative Performance Measures The Company uses a number of Alternative Performance Measures APMs in addition to those reported in accordance with IFRS.
The Directors believe that these APMs, listed below, are important when assessing the underlying financial and operating performance of the Group and its divisions.
The following APMs do not have standardised meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
4.1 Headline Headline performance, reported separately on the face of the Group Income Statement, is from continuing operations and before items reported separately on the face of the income statement.
4.2 Underlying revenue, underlying trading pro t and underlying return on sales Underlying revenue, underlying trading pro t and underlying return on sales are the headline equivalents of these measures after adjustments to exclude the effects of changes in exchange rates, business acquisitions and disposals.
Reconciliations of underlying revenue and underlying trading pro t can be found in the Financial Review.
Underlying revenue growth is one of the Groups key performance indicators and provides an important measure of organic growth of Group businesses between reporting periods, by eliminating the impact of exchange rates, acquisitions, disposals and signi cant business closures.
4.3 Return on sales ROS ROS is calculated as trading pro t divided by revenue.
It is one of the Groups key performance indicators and is used to assess the trading performance of Group businesses.
4.4 Trading pro t Trading pro t is fide ned as operating pro t before separately reported items.
It is also used as one of the targets against which the annual bonuses of certain employees are measured.
4.5 Headline pro t before tax Headline pro t before tax is calculated as the net total of trading pro t, plus the Groups share of post-tax pro t of joint ventures and total net finance costs associated with headline performance.
It is one of the Groups key performance indicators and is used to assess the financial performance of the Group as a whole.
4.6 Effective tax rate ETR The Groups ETR is calculated on the income tax costs associated with headline performance, divided by headline pro t before tax and before the Groups share of post-tax pro t of joint ventures.
Alternative Performance Measures continued 4.7 Headline earnings per share Headline earnings per share is calculated by dividing headline pro t before tax less associated income tax costs, attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
It is one of the Groups key performance indicators and is used to assess the underlying earnings performance of the Group as a whole.
4.8 Operating cash ow Operating cash ow is cash generated from continuing operations before restructuring and additional pension funding contributions but after deducting capital expenditure net of asset disposals.
It is used in calculating the Groups cash conversion.
A reconciliation of cash generated from operations to operating cash ow can be found in the Financial Review.
4.9 Cash conversion Cash conversion is calculated as operating cash ow divided by trading pro t. It is useful for measuring the rate at which cash is generated from trading pro t. The calculation of cash conversion is detailed in the Financial Review.
4.10 Free cash ow Free cash ow is fide ned as net cash ow from operating activities after net outlays for the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment, dividends from joint ventures and dividends paid to non-controlling shareholders, but before additional funding contributions to Group pension plans.
It is one of the Groups key performance indicators and is used to assess the underlying cash generation of the Group and is one of the measures used in monitoring the Groups capital.
4.11 Average trade working capital to sales ratio The average trade working capital to sales ratio is calculated as the percentage of average trade working capital balances to the total revenue for the year, at constant currency.
Average trade working capital comprising inventories, trade receivables and trade payables is calculated as the average of the 12 previous month-end balances.
It is one of the Groups key performance indicators and is useful for measuring the level of working capital used in the business and is one of the measures used in monitoring the Groups capital.
4.12 Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA EBITDA is calculated as the total of trading pro t before depreciation and amortisation of non-acquired intangibles charges.
It is used in the calculation of the Groups interest cover and net debt to EBITDA ratios.
4.13 Net interest Net interest is calculated as interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable, excluding any item separately reported.
It is used in the calculation of the Groups interest cover ratio.
4.14 Interest cover Interest cover is the ratio of EBITDA to net interest.
It is one of the Groups key performance indicators and is used to assess the financial position of the Group and its ability to fund future growth.
4.15 Net debt Net debt comprises the net total of current and non-current interest-bearing borrowings and cash and short-term deposits.
Net debt is a measure of the Groups net indebtedness to banks and other external financial institutions.
4.16 Net debt to EBITDA Net debt to EBITDA is the ratio of net debt at the year-end to EBITDA for that year.
It is one of the Groups key performance indicators and is used to assess the financial position of the Group and its ability to fund future growth and is one of the measures used in monitoring the Groups capital.
4.17 Return on net assets RONA RONA is calculated as trading pro t plus share of post-tax pro t of joint ventures, divided by average net operating assets, at constant currency being the average over the previous 12 months of property, plant and equipment, trade working capital and other operating receivables and payables.
It is one of the Groups key performance indicators and is used to assess the financial performance and asset management of the Group and is one of the measures used in monitoring the Groups capital.
4.18 Constant currency Figures presented at constant currency represent December 2015 numbers retranslated to average 2016 exchange rates.

Segment Information The segment information contained in this Note makes reference to several alternative performance measures, fide nitions of which can be found in Note 4.
5.1 Business segments Operating segments for continuing operations Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Executive Directors of the Board, who make the key operating decisions and are responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.
Re ecting the Groups management and internal reporting structure, segmental information is presented in respect of the two main business segments: Steel and Foundry.
The principal activities of each of these segments are described in the Strategic Report on pages 36 to 47.
Segment revenue represents revenue from external customers inter-segment revenue is not material.
Trading pro t includes items directly attributable to a segment as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
5.2 Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered to customers after deducting rebates, discounts and value-added taxes, and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when persuasive evidence exists that the signi cant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
A provision for anticipated returns is made based primarily on historical return rates.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate elements that can be provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an extra, such as the provision of supplementary materials with equipment, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contractual arrangement.

Income Tax 10.1 Accounting policy Tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in pro t or loss except to the extent that they relate toitems charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the associated tax isalso dealt with in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax Current tax is based on taxable pro t for the year.
Taxable pro t differs from pro t before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items ofincome or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
A provision is recognised when the Group considers it has a present tax obligation as the result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions established for such uncertain tax positions are made using a best estimate of the tax expected to be paid, based on a qualitative and quantitative assessment of all relevant information.
Such a provision is typically required where the underlying tax issue is subject to interpretation and remains to be agreed, and therefore is uncertain as to outcome.
Principally the uncertain tax positions for which a provision is made relate to the interpretation of tax legislation and guidance regarding transfer pricing arrangements that have been entered into in the normal course of business.
In accordance with IAS 12, tax provisions are included as income tax payable on the face of the balance sheet, and movements in tax provisions are included within income tax charges or credits in the Group income statement.
In assessing any appropriate provision requirements for uncertain tax items, the Group considers progress made in discussions with the tax authorities, expert advice on the likely outcome and any recent developments in case law.
Due to the uncertainty associated with such tax items, it is possible that at a future date, on conclusion of the open matters, the final outcome may vary signi cantly.
Any such variations will affect the financial results in the year in which such a determination is made.
In arriving at its current tax charge, the Group also makes careful assessment of the likely impact of tax law changes.
In particular, it has considered the impact of any imminent tax reform and the actual or likely domestic enactments of the actions decided by G20 leaders in the OECD Base Erosion and Pro t Shifting Project announced in late 2015.
Vesuvius considers that these developments do not currently have a material effect on its tax position.
However, it continues to monitor developments, in particular in relation to potential tax reform as is currently under consideration in the US and elsewhere.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable pro t and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable pro ts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable pro t nor the accounting pro t. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that suf cient taxable pro ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Included in pro t from discontinued operations Note 22 is a tax credit of 9.0m 2015: nil relating to the release of a provision for possible China taxes arising during the demerger of the Alent business in 2012.
After further consultation with advisors, and in light of the publication in 2015 by the Chinese tax authorities of additional guidance on the applicable taxes, it was decided this provision was no longer required.
The Group operates in a number of countries that have differing tax rates, laws and practices.
Changes in any of these areas could, adversely or positively, impact the Groups tax charge in the future.
Continuing losses, or insuf ciency of taxable pro t to absorb all expenses, in any subsidiary could have the effect of increasing tax charges in the future as effective tax relief may not beavailable for those losses or expenses.
Other signi cant factors affecting the tax charge are described in Notes 3.4, 10.1 and 10.6.

The Group remains con dent of the recovery of this asset.
Income Tax continued 10.4 Deferred tax continued In view of its material size and nature, any tax credit re ected in the Group income statement arising from the recognition of this asset is presented separately from the tax charge on headline performance, in accordance with the principles outlined in Note 2.5.
Subsequent increase, decrease and utilisation of the resultant deferred tax asset would similarly be expected to be presented in this manner, as the Directors consider that the separate identi cation of deferred tax for material temporary differences would assist both in a better understanding of the financial performance achieved, and in making projections of future results of the Group.
Part of the US deferred tax asset is expected to be realised in respect of US pension costs which have been re ected directly in the statement of other comprehensive income, resulting in a 3.3m tax credit in the statement of other comprehensive income in 2015.
There was a consequent 3.3m utilisation of that asset recognised in the Group income statement in that year.
No further such credit arose in 2016.
Tax loss carry-forwards and other temporary differences with a tax value of 1.4m 2015: 1.3m were recognised by subsidiaries reporting a loss.
On the basis of approved business plans of these subsidiaries, the Directors consider it probable that the tax loss carry-forwards and temporary differences can be offset against future taxable pro ts.
The total deferred tax assets not recognised as at 31 December 2016 were 263.1m 2015: 256.7m, as analysed below.
In accordance with the accounting policy in Note 10.1, these items have not been recognised as deferred tax assets on the basis that their future economic bene t is not probable.
In total, there was an increase of 6.4m 2015: 2.6m decrease in net unrecognised deferred tax assets duringthe year.

Income Tax continued 10.4 Deferred tax continued Further UK corporation tax rate reductions to 19% from1April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020, were substantively enacted on 6 September 2016.
Accordingly, the Groups closing UK deferred tax liability has been provided using a tax rate of 17% except where the reversals are expected to arise prior to 1 April 2020.

10.6 Key factors impacting the sustainability of the effective tax rate are as follows: Material changes in the geographic mix of pro ts The Groups effective tax rate is sensitive to changes in the geographic mix of pro ts and level of pro ts, and re ects a combination of higher rates in certain jurisdictions such as India, Mexico, Germany and Belgium, nil effective tax rates in the UK and the US due to the availability of unutilised tax losses and rates that lie somewhere in between.
The Group experienced such a change in mix in 2016 principally as a result of good business performance in India, giving rise to the increase in its effective tax rate on headline performance to 26.4% compared to the equivalent rate in 2015 of 25.5%.
Changes in tax rates Changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates could have a material effect on the Groups effective tax rate.
As stated in Note 10.1, the Group is tracking closely the impact on its business of domestic enactments of the actions decided by G20 leaders in the OECD Base Erosion and Pro t Shifting Project announced in late 2015, and other possible tax reform worldwide particularly in the US.
Availability of tax advantaged rates Vesuvius in China quali es for a tax advantaged rate of 15% rather than the headline rate of 25%, on part of its pro ts due to the high technology nature of its business.
Eligibility for this rate is reviewed on a regular basis by the Chinese tax authority, and was worth approximately 1.0m in 2016 2015: 0.7m.
Without that bene t, the Groups effective tax rate on headline performance, would have been 0.8% higher in 2016 2015: 0.7%.
Resolution of tax judgements At any one time, the Group can be subject to a number of challenges by tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
The outcome of these challenges is inherently uncertain, potentially resulting in a different tax charge from the amounts initially provided.
Timing of recognising tax bene ts from brought forward losses in the US In accordance with the criteria set out in Note 10.1, movements on the US deferred tax asset are recognised in separately reported items.
Consequently, such movements have no impact on the Groups effective tax rate on headline performance.
Should, however, the 2016 pro ts earned in the US have been fully subject to US Federal and State taxes, then the Groups effective tax rate on headline performance excluding the Groups share of post-tax pro t of joint ventures would have been approximately 3.4% higher 2015: 5% higher.
Earnings per Share EPS 11.1 Earnings for EPS Basic and diluted EPS from continuing operations are based upon the pro t attributable to owners of the parent, as reported in the Group income statement, of 46.7m 2015: 47.4m, being the pro t for the year of 53.0m 2015: 52.6m less non-controlling interests of 6.3m 2015: 5.2m : basic and diluted EPS from total operations are based on the pro t attributable to owners of the parent of 56.9m 2015: 48.8m : headline and diluted headline EPS are based upon headline pro t from continuing operations attributable toowners of the parent of 82.1m 2015: 75.7m.

Property, Plant and Equipment 15.1 Accounting policy Freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs are capitalised only when it is probable that they will result in future economic bene ts owing to the Group and when they can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance expenditure arecharged to the Group income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an in nite life.
Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins when the asset is available for use and is charged to the Group income statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost less residual value of the asset over its estimated useful life as follows: Financial Statements 129 15.

As described inNote 17.1, an assets carrying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount if its carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing sales proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in the Group incomestatement.

Vesuvius plc 130 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 16.
Intangible Assets Intangible assets comprise goodwill and other intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations.
16.1 Accounting policy a Goodwill Goodwill arising in a business combination is initially recognised as an asset at cost, measured as the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest acquired over the net of the acquisition-date fair value amounts of the identi able assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in pro t or loss.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, with impairment testing carried out annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated may be impaired.
On disposal of a business, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the calculation of the pro t or loss on disposal.
b Other intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised on business combinations if they are separable, or if they arise from contractual orother legal rights, and their value can be measured reliably.
They are initially measured at cost, which is equal to the acquisition-date fair value, and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation charges and accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets are subject to impairment testing when there is an indication that an impairment loss may have been incurred and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
c Research and development costs The Groups research activity involves long-range, blue sky investigation, the findings from which may be used in the future to develop new or substantially improved products.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Development is the application of research findings for the production of new or substantially improved products, processes and services before the start of commercial production.
Development expenditure is capitalised only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic bene ts are probable and the Group intends to and has suf cient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.
Otherwise, it is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure, where there is any, is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
In determining whether development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset, management considers whether the strict intangible asset recognition criteria set out in IAS 38, Intangible Assets, have been met at the time the expenditure is incurred.
In making this determination, management recognise that a signi cant amount of the development expenditure undertaken by the Group is focused on dealing with local customer technical support issues and incremental developments to existing products as opposed to new or substantially improved products, and that at the time the feasibility of the project is determined a signi cant proportion of the development expenditure for that project has already been incurred.

Intangible Assets continued 16.3 Analysis of goodwill by cash-generating unit CGU Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Groups CGUs expected to bene t from the synergies of the combination.
For the purposes of impairment testing, the Directors consider that the Group has two CGUs: the Steel division and the Foundry division.
These CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored.

Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets 17.1 Accounting policy The Directors regularly review the performance of the business and the external business environment to determine whether there is any indication that the Groups tangible and intangible assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If such indication exists, the higher of the value in use and the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated and compared to the carrying value in order to determine the extent, ifany, of the impairment loss.
Where it is not feasible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Directors estimate the recoverable amount ofthe CGU to which the asset belongs.
In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Groups CGUs expected to bene t from the synergies of the combination and the Directors carry out annual impairment testing of the carrying value of each CGU, to assess the need for any impairment of the carrying value of the associated goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of i its fair value less costs to sell and ii itsvalue in use.
If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
An impairment loss recognised in a prior year for an asset other than goodwill may be reversed where there has been a change in the estimates used to measure the assets recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised.
Vesuvius plc 132 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 17.
Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets continued 17.2 Key assumptions The key assumptions used in determining value in use are return on sales, growth rates and discount rates.
Return on sales assumptions are based on historical financial information, adjusted to factor in the anticipated impact of restructuring and rationalisation plans already announced at the balance sheet date.
The value in use calculations of the Groups CGUs are based on three-year business plans and a terminal growth rate of 2.5% 2015: 2.5%.
The cash ows are discounted to their current value using pre-tax discount rates, which represent each CGUs weighted average cost of capital WACC.
Growth rates are determined with reference to: current market conditions: external forecasts and historical trends for the Groups key end-markets of Steel and Foundry: and expected growth in output within the industries in which each major Group business unit operates.
A perpetuity growth rate of 2.5% 2015: 2.5% has been applied.
The pre-tax discount rate is the WACC calculated for each CGU as at 31 December 2016 based on industry-speci c beta coef cients for the industries in which the CGUs operate, risk-free rates, and equity risk premia related to the major countries in which the CGUs are located, selecting countries which contribute at least 80% of total CGU revenue.
The pre-tax discount rate used for the Steel CGU was 10.9% 2015: 11.1% and for the Foundry CGU was 13.2% 2015: 13.0%.
The decrease in Steels pre-tax discount rate is driven by a reduction in global risk free rates as reserve banks lower these to stimulate growth.
In Foundry, the impact of this decrease has been more than offset by increasing contributions from emerging markets, providing upward pressure on beta and equity risk premiums.
A sensitivity analysis undertaken in respect of the 2016 impairment testing assuming a 1.0% increase in each of the CGU discount rates and a 1.0% perpetuity growth rate still resulted in headroom remaining in which the recoverable amount of each CGU exceeded its carryingvalue.
A pre-tax discount rate of 13.9% would result in an impairment of Steel intangible assets and 16.2% for Foundry.
17.3 Goodwill impairment In assessing goodwill for potential impairment as at 31 December 2016, the Directors made use of detailed calculations of the recoverable amount of the Groups CGUs as at 31 December 2016.
Those calculations resulted in recoverable amounts signi cantly higher than the carrying values of each of the Groups CGUs and consequently no impairment charges were recognised.
Trade and Other Receivables 18.1 Accounting policy Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, lessimpairmentlosses.

All the Groups operating companies have policies and procedures in place to assess the creditworthiness of the customers with whom they do business.
Where objective evidence exists that a trade receivable balance may be impaired, provision is made for the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash that will be recovered.
Evidence of impairment may include such factors as the customer being in breach of contract, or entering bankruptcy or financial reorganisation proceedings.
Impairment provisions are assessed on an individual customer basis for all signi cant outstanding balances and collectively for all remaining balances, based upon historical loss experience.
Historical experience has shown that the Groups trade receivable provisions aremaintained at levels that are suf cient to absorb actual bad debt write-offs, without being excessive.
Trade and Other Receivables continued 18.2 Analysis of trade and other receivables continued In prior years under its non-recourse factoring arrangements, the Group sold trade receivables balances to a third-party factoring company in exchange for a cash payment from the factoring company, net of fees.
All the risks and rewards of the trade receivables subject to these arrangements were transferred to the factoring company and, accordingly, the trade receivables were derecognised in the Group balance sheet.
Such arrangements were used from time to time by the Group to manage the recovery of cash from its trade receivables.
As at 31 December 2016, the Group balance sheet included nil 2015: 4.7m of cash that would otherwise have been reported as trade receivables if these arrangements were not in place.
The movement since the prior year of 4.7m is due to the retirement of the debt factoring programme.
Factoring fees incurred during the year ended 31 December 2016, which are charged to the Group income statement within ordinary finance costs, amounted to nil 2015: 0.2m.

Inventories 19.1 Accounting policy Inventories are stated at the lower of cost using the first in, first out method and net realisable value.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred in purchasing or manufacturing inventories together with all other costs directly incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition and, where appropriate, attributable production overheads based on normal activity levels.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value is recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down occurs.

Derivative Financial Instruments 20.1 Accounting policy The Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives, in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, and interest rate swaps to manage the effects ofits exposure to foreign exchange risk, and interest rate risk.
The way in which derivatives are used to manage theGroups financial risk is detailed in Note 27.
Derivatives are measured at fair value.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated using market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of an interest rate swap is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparty.
The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Strict conditions have to be satis ed in order to qualify for hedge accounting, including a determination both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis that the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair values or cash ows attributable to the hedged risk.
The change infair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes is recognised immediately in theGroup income statement.
No derivatives are held for speculative purposes.
Cash ow hedges The effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a cash ow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading pro t, orwithin finance costs in the case of interest rate swaps designated as cash ow hedges.
When the transaction that was being hedged isrealised and affects pro t or loss, the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised inthe income statement in the same period.
Fair value hedges The change in fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge is recognised within trading pro t in the Group income statement.
The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in its fair value that is attributable to the hedged risk and this adjustment is recognised within trading pro t inthe Group income statement.
Net investment hedges The effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity, and is subsequently recognised in the Group income statement as part of the pro t or loss on disposal ofthe net investment.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading pro t in the Group income statement.

If approved by shareholders, the dividend will be paid on 19 May 2017 to ordinary shareholders on the register at 7 April 2017.
Financial Risk Management 27.1 Accounting policy a Non-derivative financial instruments Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
b Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the results and financial position of each entity are translated into pound sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency Transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each subsequent balance sheet date: i Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising onthe settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the Group income statement ii Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Translation from functional currency to presentational currency When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Groups presentational currency pound sterling, its results and financial position are translated into the presentational currency as follows: i Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date ii Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such average rates does notapproximate the exchange rate at the date of a speci c transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used iii All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and are reclassi ed to pro t or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.
Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entitys net investment in a foreign operation are initially recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and reclassi ed to pro t or loss on disposal ofthe net investment.
27.2 Financial risk factors The Groups Treasury department, acting in accordance with policies approved by the Board, is principally responsible for managing the financial risks faced by the Group.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most signi cant of which are market risk and liquidity risk.
a Market risk Market risk is the risk that either the fair values or the cash ows of the Groups financial instruments may uctuate because of changes in market prices.
The Group is principally exposed to market risk through uctuations in exchange rates currency risk and interest rates interest rate risk.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on its borrowings and financial assets being cash and short-term deposits that are denominated in currencies other than pound sterling.
The Groups general policy is proportionally to match the currency pro le of its core borrowings with the currency pro le of its earnings and net assets.
This is achieved, where necessary, by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts FX swaps.
The currency pro le of the Groups borrowings and financial assets, re ecting the effect of the FX swaps, isshownin the table overleaf.

Where borrowings are held at oating rates of interest, uctuations in interest rates expose the Group to variability in the cash ows associated with its interest payments, and where borrowings are held at xed rates of interest, uctuations in interest rates expose the Group to changes in the fair value of its borrowings.
The Groups policy is to maintain a mix of xed and oating rate borrowings, within certain parameters agreed from time to time by the Board, in order to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
Financial Risk Management continued 27.2 Financial risk factors continued a Market risk continued As at 31 December 2016, the Group had $310m and 30m 276.9m in total of US Private Placement Loan Notes USPP outstanding, which carry a xed rate of interest, representing two-thirds of the Groups total borrowings outstanding at that date.

The xed rate financial liabilities of 275.2m 2015: 230.2m have a weighted average interest rate of 4.6% 2015: 4.6% and a weighted average period for which the rate is xed of 4.2 years 2015: 5.2 years.
The financial assets attract oating rate interest atthe inter-bank offered rate of the appropriate currency, less a margin.
Based upon the interest rate pro le of the Groups financial assets and liabilities shown in the tables above, a 1% increase in market interest rates would increase both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash ows by 0.5m 2015: 0.6m, and a 1% reduction in market interest rates would decrease both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash ows by 0.5m 2015: 0.6m.
Similarly, a 1% increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 10.7m 2015: 11.0m in the fair value of the Groups net debt and a1% decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 11.4m 2015: 11.8m in the fair value of the Groups net debt.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group might have dif culties in meeting its financial obligations.
The Group manages this risk by ensuring that it maintains suf cient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents to ensure that it can meet its operational cash ow requirements and any maturing financial liabilities, whilst at all times operating within its financial covenants.
Thelevel of operational headroom provided by the Groups committed borrowing facilities is reviewed at least annually as part of the Groups three-year planning process.
Where this process indicates a need for additional finance, this is normally addressed 12 to 18 months in advance bymeans of either additional committed bank facilities or raising finance in the capital markets.
As at 31 December 2016, the Group had committed borrowing facilities of 576.9m 2015: 532.4m, of which 158.3m 2015: 181.1m were undrawn.
These undrawn facilities are due to expire in June 2020.
The Groups borrowing requirements are met by USPP and a multi-currency committed syndicated bank facility of 300m 2015: 300m.
The syndicated bank facility is repayable in June 2020.

27.3 Capital management The Company considers its capital to be equal to the sum of its total equity and net debt.
It monitors its capital using a number of KPIs, including free cash ow, average working capital to sales ratios, net debt to EBITDA ratios and RONA Note 4.
TheGroups objectives when managing its capital are: To ensure that the Group and all of its businesses are able to operate as going concerns and ensure that the Group operates within the financial covenants contained within its debt facilities To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver acceptable future returns toinvestors To maintain suf cient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events To maximise shareholder value through maintaining an appropriate balance between the Groups equity and net debt.
The Group operated within the requirements of its debt covenants throughout the year and has suf cient liquidity headroom within its committed debt facilities.
Details of the Groups covenant compliance and committed debt facilities can be found inthe Strategic Report on page 31.

Employee Bene ts 28.1 Accounting policy The net surplus or net liability recognised in the Group balance sheet for the Groups fide ned bene t plans is the present value of the fide ned bene t obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the plan assets.
The fide ned bene t obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and by discounting the estimated future cash ows using interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.
Any asset recognised in respect of a surplus arising from this calculation is limited to the asset ceiling, where this is the present value of any economic bene ts available in the form of refunds or reductions in future contributions in respect of the plans.
The expense for the Groups fide ned bene t plans is recognised in the Group income statement as shown in Note 28.8.
Actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and liabilities of the plans are reported within the Group statement of comprehensive income: and gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments are recognised in the Group income statement in the same line as the item that gave rise tothe settlement or curtailment or, if material, separately reported as a component of operating pro t. 28.2 Group post-retirement plans The Group operates a number of pension plans around the world, both of the fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution type, and accounts for them in accordance with IAS 19.
The Groups principal fide ned bene t pension plans are in the UK and the US, the bene ts of which are based upon the final pensionable salaries of plan members.
The assets of these plans are held separately from the Group in trustee-administered funds.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans bene ciaries.
The principal risks faced by these plans comprise: i the risk that the value of the plan assets is not suf cient to meet all plan liabilities as they fall due: ii the risk that plan bene ciaries live longer than envisaged, causing liabilities to exceed the available plan assets: and iii the risk that the market-based factors used to value plan liabilities and assets change materially adversely to increase plan liabilities over the value of available plan assets.
The Group also has fide ned bene t pension plans inother territories but, with the exception of those in Germany, these are not individually material in relation to the Group as a whole.

Employee Bene ts continued 28.2 Group post-retirement plans continued a fide ned bene t pension plans UK The Groups main fide ned bene t pension plan in the UK the UK Plan is closed to new members and to future bene t accrual.
The existing plan was established under a trust deed and is subject to the Pension Act 2004 and guidance issued by the UK Pension Regulator.
A full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the UK Plan Trustee in line with the requirements of the Pension Act 2004, and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2015.
At that date, the market value of plan assets was 536.7m and this represented a funding level of 102% of the accrued plan bene ts at the time of 526.4m.
Calculated on a buy-out basis using an estimation of the cost of buying out the UK Plan bene ts with an insurance company, the liabilities at that date were 687.5m, representing a funding level of 78%.
Although there is no minimum funding requirement in the Pension Act 2004, under the rules of the UK Plan, the Trustee has the power to set the funding contributions taking into account the results of the triennial valuation, and after having consulted with the Company.
Notwithstanding the latest funding valuation surplus, the Company has agreed to continue to make voluntary contributions at the rate of 2.0m per annum.
The value of the UK Plan liabilities as at 31 December 2016 increased to 527.4m 2015: 464.3m.
The increase in the liabilities was driven mainly by the decrease in discount rates to 2.70% in 2016 2015: 3.75%.
Correspondingly, the UK Plan assets increased to 604.1m 2015: 522.0m mainly driven by the increases in the values of the annuity insurance contract of 24.3m and the xed income holdings of 54.3m.
The insurance contract valuation has risen due to the reduction in interest rates noted above and offsets the UK plan losses.
The increase in the xed income holdings is attributable to the investment in xed income UK Gilts, whose market value has risen due to lower interest rates and general market demand for low risk investments.
Proposed amendments to IFRIC 14, The Limit on a fide ned Bene t Asset, Minimum Finding Requirements and their interaction, address how the powers of other parties, such as the trustees of the plan, affect an entitys right of refund of a surplus from the plan.
The Group has assessed the likely impact of the application of the interaction and concluded that it would not impact its ability to continue to recognise a pension surplus.
b fide ned bene t pension plans US The Group has a number of fide ned bene t pension plans in the US, providing retirement bene ts based on final salary or a xed bene t. The Groups principal US fide ned bene t pension plans are closed to new members and also to future bene t accrual for existing members.
Actuarial valuations of the US fide ned bene t pension plans are carried out every year and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2016.
At that date the market value of the plan assets was 49.2m, representing a funding level of 66% of funded accrued plan bene ts at that date using the projected unit method of valuation of 74.3m.
Funding levels for the Groups US fide ned bene t pension plans are normally based upon annual valuations carried out by independent quali ed actuaries and are governed by USGovernment regulations.
The value of US plan liabilities decreased to 86.8m 2015: 112.1m, which was mainly attributable to a buy-out of the majority of current pensioners that took place during the year which resulted in a 45.1m decrease in the liability.
This signi cant decrease was partially offset by exchange losses of 17.5m and a loss of 4.4m due to the lower discount rate.
The loss arising from changes in financial assumptions is solely attributable to the decrease in the discount rates to 3.8% 2015: 3.9%.
The Groups US fide ned bene t pension plans are subject to the minimum contribution requirements of Internal Revenue Code Sections 412 and 430.
Contributions are determined by trustees, in consultation with the company, based on the annual valuations which are submitted to the Internal Revenue Service.
For the plan year beginning 1 January 2016, the minimum required contribution was nil.
c fide ned bene t pension plans Germany The Group has a number of fide ned bene t pension arrangements in Germany which are unfunded, as is common practice in that country.
The main plan was closed to new entrants on 31 December 2016 and replaced by a fide ned contribution plan for new joiners.
The net liability of the German plans at 31 December 2016 was 45.3m 2015: 36.3m.
The increase was driven by the decrease in discount rate which resulted in an increase in the liability and exchange losses of 5.8m due to the strengthening of the euro against the pound.
These increases were offset by a settlement of 3.5m, funded by a cash payment of 2.3m, after members were offered the opportunity of moving their existing plans into a new fide ned contribution plan.
d fide ned bene t pension plans ROW The Group has a number of fide ned bene t pension arrangements across the rest of the world, the majority of which are located in Belgium.
The net liability of the ROW plans at 31 December 2016 was 16.1m 2015: 13.3m.
The increase was mainly attributable to exchange losses of 2.1m due to the weakening of the pound post-Brexit and signi cant services costs of 2.3m recognised in respect of the Belgian plans.
Employee Bene ts continued 28.2 Group post-retirement plans continued e fide ned contribution pension plans The total expense for the Groups fide ned contribution plans in the Group income statement amounted to 10.8m 2015: 10.7m continuing operations and represents the contributions payable for the year by the Group to the plans.
f Multi-employer plans Due to collective agreements, Vesuvius in the US participates together with other enterprises in union run multi-employer pension plans for temporary workers hired on sites.
Some of these plans are underfunded and all participating employers are ultimately liable for any fide cit.
If a participating employer stops contributing to a plan it is required to make a withdrawal payment to the plan to cover its share of the total fide cit in the plan.
No reliable basis exists for allocation of the plans obligations and plan assets to individual employer participants.
fide cits in the plans may necessitate increased contributions in the future.
These are currently accounted for as fide ned contribution plans.
In 2016 Vesuvius contributed 1.2m 2015: 1.1m to these plans.
28.3 Post-retirement liability valuation The main assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Groups fide ned bene t pension plans, as detailed below, areset by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally quali ed actuaries.
a Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the Groups UK, US and German fide ned bene t pension liabilities are summarised in the table below and have been selected to re ect the characteristics and experience of the membership of those plans.
For the UK Plan, the assumptions used have been derived from the Self-Administered Pension Schemes SAPS All table, with future longevity improvements in line with the core mortality improvement tables published in 2016 by the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI, with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per annum.
For the Groups US plans, the assumptions used have been based on the standard RP-2016 fully generational tables with projection scale BB, and the MP-2016 mortality improvement scale.
The Groups major plans in Germany have been valued using the Heubeck Richttafeln 2005G mortality tables.
In respect of the life expectancy tables below, current pensioners are assumed to be 65 years old: while future pensioners are assumed to be 45 years old.

The UK discount rate in the above table is based on the Aon Hewitt AA-rated corporate bond yield in conjunction with the most recent projected cash ow data relating to the UK Plan liabilities: the US discount rate is based on the Citigroup pension discount curve: and the Germany discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over ten-year euro corporates AAindex.
The assumptions for UK price in ation are set by reference to the difference between yields on longer-term conventional government bonds and index-linked bonds, except for CPI, for which no appropriate bonds exist, which is assumed to be 1.1 points lower 2015: 1.1 points lower than RPI-basedin ation.

Employee Bene ts continued 28.3 Post-retirement liability valuation continued c Sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in signi cant IAS 19 actuarial assumptions The following table analyses, for the Groups main UK, US and Germany pension plans, the theoretical estimated impact on plan liabilities and assets resulting from changes to the most signi cant actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 valuation purposes, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
Following the arrangement of buy-in agreements for the UK plan pensioner liabilities in 2012, as noted above, and the fact that USpensions are not in ation linked, the rate of increase in pensionable salaries and of pensions in payment is not signi cant to thevaluation of the Groups overall pension liabilities.
As stated above, during 2012 the UK Plan entered into pension insurance buy-in agreements which eliminate the in ation, interest rate, investment and longevity risk in respect of the pensioner liabilities covered by the agreements.
Therefore, for the liabilities so covered, which represent some 47.9% of the total liabilities of the UK Plan, any changes in the valuation assumptions which impact on the value of those liabilities, also impact on the associated annuity assets in an equal and opposite way, thereby fully mitigating the valuation risk.
This is also re ected in the following table.

In addition, the UK Plan holds a liability driven investment portfolio of financial derivative contracts which reduces the risk that the UK Plans assets would fall materially, relative to the value of its economic liabilities.
The UK Plan Trustee has entered into a pension insurance buy-in agreement with the Pension Insurance Corporation PIC, whereby the UK Plan Trustee has paid insurance premiums to PIC to insure a significant portion of the UK Plans liabilities.
Under this arrangement, the value of the PIC insurance contract matches the value of the liabilities because the inflation, interest rate, investment and longevity risk for Vesuvius in respect of these liabilities are eliminated.
As at 31 December 2016, the IAS 19 valuation of the PIC insurance contract value associated with the bought-in liabilities was 289.6m 2015: 265.3m.
The buy-in agreement ensures that the UK pension plan obligations in respect of all its retired members and their approved dependants are insured.
The policy and the associated valuation are updated annually to reflect retirements and mortality.
In the current year, the agreement based on specific membership data covers 55% of UK pension plan obligations, removing all financial risks associated with this tranche of the liability.

At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, award holders receive the value of dividends that would have been paid on their vested shares in the period between grant and vesting.
Accordingly, there is no discount to the valuation for dividends foregone during the vesting period.

There is no signi cant difference between the fair value of the Groups trade and other payables balances and the amount at which they are reported in the Group balance sheet.
Leases 31.1 Accounting policy Leases are classi ed as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classi ed as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Bene ts received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
31.2 Operating lease commitments The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are payable as follows: 2016 2015 m m Not later than one year 9.0 9.0 Later than one year and not later than five years 15.8 17.2 Later than five years 7.0 7.7 Total operating lease commitments 31.8 33.9 Restated to re ect the inclusion of previously omitted operating lease commitments totalling 9.7m at 31 December 2015.
There is no effect on net assets or reported results for any period presented.
The Groups property, plant and equipment assets are either purchased outright or held under lease contracts.
Where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group, the asset is capitalised in the Group balance sheet and the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a finance lease obligation.
Where all the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group, the lease is classi ed as an operating lease and neither the asset nor the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised in the Group balance sheet.
The net book value of the Groups property, plant and equipment assets held under finance lease contracts at 31 December 2016 was 4.7m 2015: 3.8m.
The cost incurred by the Group in the year in respect of assets held under operating leases, all of which was charged within trading pro t, amounted to 12.4m 2015: 11.8m.

Provisions 32.1 Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that re ects both the current market assessment of the time value of money and the speci c risks associated with the obligation.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

Of the total provision balance as at 31 December 2016 of 58.6m 2015: 47.2m, 32.9m 2015: 29.5m is recognised in the Group balance sheet within non-current liabilities and 25.7m 2015: 17.7m within current liabilities.
The provision for disposal and closure costs includes the Directors current best estimate of the costs to be incurred both in the ful lment of obligations incurred in connection with former Group businesses, resulting from either disposal or closure, together with those related to the demolition and clean-up of closed sites.
The provision comprises amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims, including claims relating to product liability.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated cash out ows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next ten years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to re ect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters.
Where insurance cover exists for any of these known or probable costs, a related asset is recognised in the Group balance sheet only when its value can be reliably measured by management.
As at 31 December 2016, 14.9m 2015: 12.3m was recorded in receivables in respect of associated insurance reimbursements, of which 12.1m 2015: 9.7m is non-current.
In assessing the probable costs and realisation certainty of provisions, or related assets, reasonable assumptions are made.
Changes to the assumptions used could signi cantly alter the Directors assessment of the value, timing or certainty of the costs or related amounts.
The provision for restructuring charges includes the costs of all of the Groups recognised initiatives to rationalise its operating activities.
The balance of 18.5m as at 31 December 2016 comprises 2.7m in relation to onerous lease provisions in respect of leases terminating between one and seven years, and 15.8m in relation to expenditure on restructuring initiatives that have been announced which is expected to be paid out over the nextyear.
Other provisions comprise amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, workers compensation and medical claims, and from third-party claims.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to reasonable assumptions, legal orother regulatory process, the timing of the associated out ows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to re ect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters.
During 2016 the Group recognised net charges of 10.2m 2015: 9.2m in the income statement to provide for various litigation settlements and other claims.
OffBalance Sheet Arrangements In compliance with current reporting requirements, certain arrangements entered into by the Group in its normal course of business are not reported in the Group balance sheet.
Of such arrangements, those considered material by the Directors are future lease payments in relation to assets used by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases Note 31.
Contingent Liabilities Guarantees given by the Group under property leases of operations disposed of amounted to 1.6m 2015: 1.7m.
Details of guarantees given by the Company, on behalf of the Group, are given in Note 10 to the Company financial statements.
Vesuvius has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Several of Vesuvius subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising inthe ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and the Directors are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities.
Reserves are made for the expected amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, and from third-party claims.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which reserve is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing and amount of the associated out ows is subject to some uncertainty see Note 32 for further information.
Certain of Vesuvius subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits, predominantly in the US, relating to a small number of products containing asbestos manufactured prior to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by Vesuvius.
These suits usually also name many other product manufacturers.
To date, Vesuvius is not aware of there being any liability verdicts against any of these subsidiaries.
A number of lawsuits have been withdrawn, dismissed or settled and the amount paid, including costs, in relation to this litigation has not had a material adverse effect on Vesuvius financial position or results of operations.
Principal Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures Details of the principal subsidiaries and joint ventures of Vesuvius plc and the countries in which they are incorporated are given in Note5 to the Company financial statements, together with details of subsidiaries exempt from audit of their individual financial statements by virtue ofSection 479A of the Companies Act 2006.
Related Parties All transactions with related parties are conducted on an arms length basis and in accordance with normal business terms.
Transactions between related parties that are Group subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation.
