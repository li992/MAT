173 Financial Statements Section 7 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued 7.6 Investments in Subsidiaries Accounting policy The Companys investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment.
In testing for impairment the carrying value of the investment is compared to its recoverable amount, being its fair value less costs of disposal.
The fair value is based on the discounted future net cash flows of oil and gas assets held by the subsidiary, using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period.
For exploration assets, estimated discounted cash flows are risk-weighted for future exploration success.
Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using an estimated short-term oil price based on the forward curve and long-term oil price of US$70 per boe 2015: long-term oil price of US$80 per boe, escalation for prices and costs of 2.0% 2015: 2.0%, and a discount rate of 10% 2015: 10%.
Full details on the assumptions used for valuing oil and gas assets can be found in section 2.
These represent the award of share options of the Company to the employees of Capricorn Energy Limited a principal subsidiary of Capricorn Oil Limited.
At the year end, investments in subsidiaries were reviewed for indicators of impairment and impairment tests conducted where indicators found.
Given that the market capitalisation of Cairn is less than its net book value, impairment tests were conducted on all investments in subsidiaries held by the Company.
The Companys investment in Capricorn Oil Limited was impaired to reflect the fair value of the underlying assets of the Capricorn Oil Group.
A charge of US$26.0m was made to the income statement in 2016.
