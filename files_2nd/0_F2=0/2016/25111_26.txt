com 93 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 8 TAXATION CONTINUED FACTORS AFFECTING THE TAX CHARGE FOR THE YEAR The tax on the Groups profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the average of the enacted UK corporation tax rates for the year of 20.0 per cent 2015: 20.5 per cent as follows: million 2016 2015 Profit before tax 907 1,756 Tax at the UK corporation tax rate 181 360 Tax effects of: Differences in effective tax rates on overseas earnings 90 110 Movement in provision for uncertain tax positions 43 44 Remeasurement of deferred tax balances 101 310 Remeasurement of deferred tax balances arising from changes in tax rates 13 Permanent differences 170 68 Adjustments in respect of prior years 35 6 Total tax charged to the consolidated income statement 238 33 Differences in effective tax rates on overseas earnings represents the impact of worldwide profits being taxed at rates different from 20 per cent.
The effective tax rate benefits from internal financing arrangements between group subsidiaries in different countries which are subject to differing tax rates and legislation and the application of double taxation treaties.
The movement between 2015 and 2016 is largely driven by increased earnings in the USA and other jurisdictions where the tax rate is higher than 20 per cent.
Remeasurement of deferred tax balances mainly represents the recognition of deferred tax assets previously not recognised.
Of the 101 million 2015: 310 million remeasurement, most of which relates to the Groups Spanish business, 89 million 2015: nil relates to tax deductible amortisation and the balance of 12 million 2015: 310 million relates to losses and other deferred tax assets.
The 2015 remeasurement related to the recognition of deferred tax assets following the USA acquisition.
The Groups assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on a review of underlying performance of subsidiaries, changes in tax legislation and the interpretation thereof and changes in the group structure.
Permanent differences include 79 million in respect of non-deductible exchange losses 2015: 33 million gains and 31 million 2015: 18 million in respect of non-deductible interest expenses.
MOVEMENT ON CURRENT TAX ACCOUNT million 2016 2015 At 1 October 111 32 Charged to the consolidated income statement 500 485 Charged to equity 6 3 Cash paid 401 408 Exchange movements 24 Other movements 1 1 At 30 September 239 111 The cash tax paid in the year is 99 million 2015: 77 million less than the current tax charge.
This arises as a result of timing differences between the accrual of income taxes and the actual payment of cash and the movement in the provision for uncertain tax positions.
ANALYSED AS: million 2016 2015 Assets 45 56 Liabilities 284 167 239 111 UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS As an international business the Group is exposed to uncertain tax positions and changes in legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
The Groups uncertain tax positions principally include cross-border transfer pricing, interpretation of new or complex tax legislation and tax arising on the valuation of assets.
The Group is also monitoring developments in relation to EU State Aid investigations but does not currently consider any provision is required.
The assessment of uncertain tax positions is subjective and significant management judgement is required.
This judgement is based on interpretation of legislation, management experience and professional advice.
Provisions arising from uncertain tax positions taken in the calculation of tax assets and liabilities are included within current tax liabilities.
At 30 September 2016 the total value of these provisions, including foreign exchange movements, was 165 million 2015: 114 million.
It is possible that amounts paid will be different from the amounts provided.
Management have assessed the Groups provision for uncertain tax positions and are comfortable that apart from the French matter referred to below, the provisions in place are not material individually or in aggregate, and that a reasonably possible change in the next financial year would not have a material impact on the results of the Group.
94 Imperial Brands PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 94 Imperial Brands | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS In November 2015 the Group received a challenge from the French tax authorities that could lead to additional tax liabilities of up to 253 million.
The challenge concerns the valuation placed on the shares of Altadis Distribution France now known as Logista France following an intra group transfer of the shares in October 2012 and the tax consequences flowing from a potentially higher value that is argued for by the tax authorities.
Based on professional advice, an amount of 41 million 2015: 23 million is included in the provision for uncertain tax positions.

Intangible amortisation and impairment are included within administrative and other expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Amortisation and impairment in respect of intangible assets other than software and internally generated intellectual property are treated as reconciling items between reported operating profit and adjusted operating profit.
GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT REVIEW Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
For the Tobacco business CGUs are based on the markets where the business operates and are grouped in line with the divisional structure in operation during the year.
The groupings represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
A summary of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives is set out below.
com 97 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 11 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Goodwill has arisen principally on the acquisitions of Reemtsma in 2002 all CGU groupings, Commonwealth Brands in 2007 USA, Altadis in 2008 all CGU groupings and ITG Brands in 2015 USA.
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that impairment may have arisen.
The value of a CGU, or group of CGUs as appropriate, is based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections derived from three year financial plans which are approved by the Board annually and are based on detailed bottom-up market-by-market forecasts of projected sales volumes for each product line.
These forecasts reflect, on an individual market basis, numerous assumptions and estimates regarding anticipated changes in market size, prices and duty regimes, consumer uptrading and downtrading, consumer preferences and other changes in product mix, based on long-term market trends, market data, anticipated regulatory developments, and management experience and expectations.
We consider that pricing, market size, market shares and cost inflation are the key assumptions used in our plans.
GROWTH RATES AND DISCOUNT RATES USED The compound annual growth rates implicit in these value-in-use calculations are shown below.
2016 Pre-tax Initial growth Long-term % discount rate rate growth rate Returns Markets North 9.0 1.1 1.8 Returns Markets South 11.3 0.1 1.8 Growth Markets 9.1-15.8 4.7-10.4 1.2-4.0 USA 10.1 4.3 2.5 Logistics 9.6 6.5 1.8 Cash flows from the three year plan period are extrapolated out to year five using the growth rate implicit in the three year plan, shown in the table above as the initial growth rate.
Estimated long-term weighted average compound annual growth rates of between 1.2 per cent and 4.0 per cent per annum are used beyond year five.
Long-term growth rates are based on managements long-term expectations, taking account of industry specific factors such as the nature of our products, the role of excise in government fiscal policy, and relatively stable and predictable long-term macro trends in the Tobacco industry.
Discount rates used are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the different risk profiles of the CGUs.
Our impairment projections are prepared under the basis set out in IAS 36 which can differ from our internal plans.
GROWTH MARKETS Within our Growth Markets reporting segment, there are a number of CGU groupings based on our operating segments, including Drive Growth and Other Premium Cigar.
The Drive Growth CGU grouping includes our markets in Russia, Italy and Japan.
Our impairment test for this CGU grouping indicated headroom of 210 million, and assumed an initial growth rate of 10.4 per cent.
This growth rate reflects forecast benefits of increased investment behind growth brands and portfolio rationalisation, with significant investment in the earlier years forecast to deliver growth in the medium term.
A reduction of around 50 per cent in the initial growth rate for these markets would cause the carrying value to equal the recoverable amount.
The impairment test for our Other Premium Cigar CGU grouping that includes our non-Cuban Premium Cigar business indicated headroom of 100 million.
A reduction in overall forecast cash flows of 16 per cent, or a reduction in the initial growth rate of 370 basis points from 4.7 per cent, would cause the carrying value to equal the recoverable amount.
OTHER CGU GROUPINGS For the rest of the Group, any reasonable movement in the assumptions used in the impairment tests would not result in an impairment.

FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Overview In the normal course of business, the Group is exposed to financial risks including, but not limited to, market, credit and liquidity risk.
This note explains the Groups exposure to these risks, how they are measured and assessed, and summarises the policies and processes used to manage them, including those related to the management of capital.
The Group operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for the management of the financial risks of the Group, together with its financing and liquidity requirements.
Financial risks comprise exposures to funding and liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and counterparty credit risk.
The treasury function is also responsible for the financial risk management of the Groups global pension schemes.
The Group operates on a global basis and manages its capital to ensure that subsidiaries are able to operate as going concerns and to optimise returns to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity.
The Groups treasury activities are monitored by the Treasury Committee, which meets regularly throughout the year and comprises the Chief Financial Officer, the Company Secretary and other senior management from finance and treasury.
The Treasury Committee operates in accordance with the terms of reference set out by the Board and a framework the Treasury Committee framework which sets out the expectations and boundaries to assist in the effective oversight of treasury activities.
The Director of Treasury reports on a regular basis to the Treasury Committee.
The Board reviews and approves all major treasury decisions.
The treasury function does not operate as a profit centre, nor does it enter into speculative transactions.
The Groups management of financial risks cover the following: A MARKET RISK Price risk The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk other than assets held by its pension funds disclosed in note 22.
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in that there may be fluctuations in the price of tobacco leaf.
As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf tends to be cyclical as supply and demand considerations influence tobacco plantings in those countries where tobacco is grown.
Also, different regions may experience variations in weather patterns that may affect crop quality or supply and so lead to changes in price.
The Group seeks to reduce this price risk by sourcing tobacco leaf from a number of different countries and counterparties and by varying the levels of tobacco leaf held.
Currently, these techniques reduce the expected exposure to this risk over the short to medium term to levels considered not material and accordingly, no sensitivity analysis has been presented.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates due to its commercial trading transactions and profits denominated in foreign currencies, as well as the translation of cash, borrowings and derivatives held in non-functional currencies.
com 103 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 19.
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS CONTINUED The Groups financial results are principally exposed to fluctuations in euro and US dollar exchange rates.
Management of the Groups foreign exchange transaction and translation risk is addressed below.
Transaction risk The Groups material transaction exposures arise on costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of subsidiaries, including the purchase of tobacco leaf, which is sourced from various countries but purchased principally in US dollars, and packaging materials which are sourced from various countries and purchased in a number of currencies.
The Groups sterling dividends to external shareholders are primarily sourced from foreign subsidiary earnings.
Foreign currency flows are matched where possible and remaining foreign currency transaction exposures are not hedged.
Translation risk The Group seeks to broadly match the currency of borrowings to the currency of its underlying investments in overseas subsidiaries, which are primarily euros and US dollars.
The Group issues debt in the most appropriate market or markets at the time of raising new finance and has a policy of using derivative financial instruments, primarily cross-currency swaps, to change the currency of debt as required.
Borrowings denominated in, or swapped into foreign currencies to match the Groups investments in overseas subsidiaries are treated as a hedge against the net investment where appropriate.
Foreign exchange sensitivity analysis The Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates attributable to the translation of monetary items held by Group companies in currencies other than their functional currencies is illustrated on an indicative basis below.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that net debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain constant, and that there is no change to the net investment hedge designations in place at 30 September 2016.
The sensitivity analysis does not reflect any change to revenue or non-finance costs that may result from changing exchange rates, and ignores any tax implications and offsetting effects of movements in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
2016 2015 Increase in Increase in million income income Income statement impact of non-functional currency foreign exchange exposures: 10% appreciation of euro 2015: 10% 458 60 10% appreciation of US dollar 2015: 10% 46 13 An equivalent depreciation in the above currencies would cause a decrease in income of 560 million and 57 million for euro and US dollar exchange rates respectively 2015: 73 million and 16 million.
Movements in equity in the table below relate to hedging instruments designated as net investment hedges in hedging the Groups euro denominated assets.
2016 2015 Change in Change in million equity equity Equity impact of non-functional currency foreign exchange exposures: 10% appreciation of euro 2015: 10% 494 751 10% appreciation of US dollar 2015: 10% 83 101 An equivalent depreciation in the above currencies would result in a change in equity of -604 million and -102million for euro and US dollar exchange rates respectively 2015: -918 million and -124 million.
At 30 September 2016, after the effect of derivative financial instruments, approximately -1 per cent 2015: -2 per cent of the Groups net debt was denominated in sterling, 58 per cent in euro 2015: 60 per cent, 43 per cent in US dollars 2015: 45 per cent, and nil per cent in other currencies 2015: -3 per cent.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from its borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents, with the primary exposures arising from fluctuations in euro, US dollar and sterling interest rates.
Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group manages its exposure to interest rate risk on its borrowings by entering into derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt in accordance with the Treasury Committee framework.
As at 30 September 2016, after adjusting for the effect of derivative financial instruments detailed in note 20, approximately 71 per cent 2015: 46 per cent of net debt was at fixed rates of interest and 29 per cent 2015: 54 per cent was at floating rates of interest.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The Groups sensitivity to interest rates on its euro, US dollar and sterling monetary items which are primarily external borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, is illustrated on an indicative basis below.
The impact in the Groups Income Statement reflects the effect on net finance costs in respect of the Groups net debt and the fixed to floating rate debt ratio prevailing at 30 September 2016, ignoring any tax implications and offsetting effects of movements in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that net debt and the derivatives portfolio remain constant and that there is no net impact on other comprehensive income 2015: nil.
The movement in interest rates is considered reasonable for the purpose of this analysis and the estimated effect assumes a lower limit of zero for interest rates where relevant.

The maximum aggregate credit risk to these sources is considered to be 4,860 million at 30 September 2016 2015: 5,296 million.
Trade and other receivables The Group has some significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
In order to manage its exposure to customer credit risk, policies have been implemented to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history and that credit support guarantees are obtained where appropriate.
Analysis of trade and other receivables is provided in note 15.
Financial instruments In order to manage its credit risk to any one counterparty, the Group places cash deposits and enters into derivative financial instruments with a diversified group of financial institutions carrying suitable credit ratings in line with the Treasury Committee framework.
Utilisation of counterparty credit limits is regularly monitored by treasury and ISDA agreements are in place to permit the net settlement of assets and liabilities in certain circumstances.
In a few historical cases, collateral has been deposited against derivative financial liabilities and supported by an ISDA Credit Support Annex.
The table below summarises the Groups largest exposures to financial counterparties as at 30 September 2016.
At the balance sheet date management does not expect these counterparties to default on their current obligations.
The impact of the Groups own credit risk on the fair value of derivatives and other obligations held at fair value is not considered to be material.

To manage this risk the Group has a policy of actively maintaining a mixture of short, medium and long-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds to meet the forecast requirements of the Group over the short to medium term.
To prevent over-reliance on individual sources of liquidity, funding is provided across a range of instruments including debt capital market issuance, bank term loans, bank revolving credit facilities and European commercial paper.
The Group primarily borrows centrally in order to meet forecast funding requirements, and the treasury function is in regular dialogue with subsidiary companies to ensure their liquidity needs are met.
Subsidiary companies are funded by a combination of share capital and retained earnings, intercompany loans, and in very limited cases through external local borrowings.
Cash pooling processes are used to centralise surplus cash held by subsidiaries where possible in order to minimise external borrowing requirements and interest costs.
Treasury invests surplus cash in bank deposits and uses foreign exchange contracts to manage short-term liquidity requirements in line with cash flow forecasts.
As at 30 September 2016, the Group held liquid assets of 1,274 million 2015: 2,042 million.
The table below summarises the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities by maturity based on their contractual cash flows as at 30 September 2016.
The amounts disclosed are undiscounted cash flows calculated using spot rates of exchange prevailing at the relevant balance sheet date.
Contractual cash flows in respect of the Groups derivative financial instruments are detailed in note 20.

Besides the minimum capitalisation rules that may apply to subsidiaries in different countries, the Groups only external imposed capital requirements are interest cover and gearing covenants contained within its core external bank debt facilities, with which the Group was fully compliant during the current and prior periods and expects to be so going forward.
The Group continues to target an investment grade credit rating which it monitors by reference to a number of key financial ratios, including ongoing consideration of the return of capital to shareholders via regular dividend payments and in ongoing discussions with the relevant ratings agencies.
As at 30 September 2016 the Group was rated Baa3 stable outlook by Moodys Investor Service Ltd, BBB stable outlook by Standard and Poors Credit Market Services Europe Limited and BBB stable outlook by Fitch Ratings Limited.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING The Group hedges its underlying exposures in an efficient, commercial and structured manner in line with the policies above, although the strict hedging requirements of IAS 39 may lead to some commercially effective hedge positions not qualifying for hedge accounting.
As a result, and as permitted under IAS 39, the Group has decided not to apply cash flow or fair value hedge accounting in respect of these transactions.
The Group does apply hedge accounting in respect of certain net investments in foreign operations where appropriate.
The hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is a hedge of the translation foreign currency risk arising on the foreign operation.
As at 30 September 2016 the Group had made net investment hedge designations in foreign operations in respect of external euro borrowings with a carrying value of 4,387 million 2015: 5,237 million, US dollar borrowings with a carrying value of $7,950 million 2015: $6,750 million, and cross-currency swaps with a notional value of 3,871 million 2015: 3,871 million.
The Group also treats certain permanent intragroup loans that meet relevant qualifying criteria under IAS 21 as part of its net investment in foreign operations where appropriate.
Intragroup loans with a notional value of 1,943 million 2015: 2,077 million and US dollar loans with a notional value of $6,761 million 2015: $5,077 million were treated as part of the Groups net investment in foreign operations at the balance sheet date.
FAIR VALUE ESTIMATION AND HIERARCHY All financial assets and liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at amortised cost, other than derivative financial instruments which are carried at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data such as yield curves and foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date Level 2 classification hierarchy per IFRS 7 as detailed in note 20.
There were no changes to the valuation methods or transfers between hierarchies during the year.
With the exception of capital market issuance, the fair value of all financial assets and financial liabilities is considered approximate to their carrying amount as outlined in note 18.
NETTING ARRANGEMENTS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The following tables set out the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities that are subject to netting and set-off arrangements.
Financial assets and liabilities that are subject to set-off arrangements and disclosed on a net basis in the Groups Balance Sheet primarily relate to cash pooling arrangements and collateral in respect of derivative financial instruments under ISDA Credit Support Annex.
Amounts which do not meet the criteria for offsetting on the balance sheet but could be settled net in certain circumstances principally relate to derivative transactions executed under ISDA agreements where each party has the option to settle amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party.

Collateral deposited against derivative financial liabilities under the terms and conditions of an ISDA Credit Support Annex Fair values are determined based on observable market data such as yield curves and foreign exchange rates to calculate the present value of future cash flows associated with each derivative at the balance sheet date.
The classification of these derivative assets and liabilities under the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy is provided in note 19.
MATURITY OF OBLIGATIONS UNDER DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivative financial instruments have been classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current on an undiscounted contractual basis based on spot rates as at the balance sheet date.
Some of the Groups derivative financial instruments contain early termination options.
For the purposes of the above and following analysis, maturity dates have been based on the likelihood of an option being exercised with consideration to counterparty expectations and market conditions prevailing as at 30 September 2016.
Any collateral transferred to counterparties in respect of derivative financial liabilities has been classified consistently with the related underlying derivative.
The table below summarises the Groups derivative financial instruments by maturity based on their remaining contractual cash flows as at 30 September 2016.

Foreign exchange contracts are used to manage the Groups short-term liquidity requirements in line with cash flow forecasts as appropriate.
The Group does not apply cash flow or fair value hedge accounting, as permitted under IAS 39, which results in fair value gains and losses attributable to derivative financial instruments being recognised in net finance costs unless they are designated as hedges of a net investment in foreign operations, in which case they are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Interest rate swaps To manage interest rate risk on its borrowings, the Group issues debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance with regard to currency, interest denomination or duration and then uses interest rate swaps to re-base the debt into the appropriate proportions of fixed and floating interest rates where necessary.
Interest rate swaps are also transacted to manage and re-profile the Groups interest rate risk over the short, medium and long-term in accordance with the Treasury Committee framework.
Fair value movements are recognised in net finance costs in the relevant reporting period.
As at 30 September 2016, the notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding that were entered into to convert fixed rate borrowings into floating rates of interest at the time of raising new finance were 11,676 million equivalent 2015: 11,667 million equivalent with a fair value of 1,093 million asset 2015: 721 million asset.
The fixed interest rates vary from 2.0 per cent to 8.7 per cent 2015: 2.0 per cent to 8.7 per cent, and the floating rates are EURIBOR, LIBOR and US LIBOR.
As at 30 September 2016, the notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding that were entered into to convert floating rate debt into fixed rates of interest to manage and re-profile the Groups interest rate risk were 12,462 million equivalent 2015: 10,692 million equivalent with a fair value of 1,298 million liability 2015: 741 million liability.
The fixed interest rates vary from 0.8 per cent to 5.2 per cent 2015: 0.8 per cent to 5.2 per cent, and the floating rates are EURIBOR, LIBOR and US LIBOR.
This includes forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 2,459 million equivalent 2015: 4,990 million equivalent with tenors extending for five years, starting between May 2017 and May 2022.
Cross-currency swaps The Group enters into cross-currency swaps to convert the currency of debt into the appropriate currency with consideration to the underlying assets of the Group as appropriate.
Fair value movements are recognised in net finance costs in the relevant reporting period unless they are designated as hedges of a net investment in foreign operations, in which case they are recognised in other comprehensive income.
As at 30 September 2016, the notional amount of cross-currency swaps entered into to convert issued fixed rate debt into the desired currency at floating rates of interest was 650 million 2015: 650 million and the fair value of these swaps was 56 million net liability 2015: 5 million net liability.
As at 30 September 2016, the notional amount of cross-currency swaps entered into to convert floating rate sterling debt into the desired currency at floating rates of interest was 3,100 million 2015: 3,100 million and the fair value of these swaps was 392 million net liability 2015: 232 million net asset.
HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS As at 30 September 2016, cross-currency swaps with a notional amount of 3,871 million 2015: 3,871 million were designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
During the year, foreign exchange translation losses amounting to 474 million 2015: 202 million gains were recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of cross-currency swaps that had been designated as hedges of a net investment in foreign operations.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts to manage short-term liquidity requirements in line with cash flow forecasts.
As at 30 September 2016 the notional amount of these contracts was 1,531 million equivalent 2015: 867 million equivalent and the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of 2 million 2015: 8 million net asset.

Deferred tax assets of 159 million 2015: 143 million have not been recognised due to the potential uncertainty of the utilisation of the credits.
Of these unrecognised deferred tax assets 63 million are expected to expire between 2021 and 2027.
We have reviewed the recoverability of deferred tax assets in overseas territories in the light of forecast business performance, changes in tax legislation and the interpretation thereof.
Consequently, we have increased deferred tax assets of 118 million 2015: 308 million increase previously not recognised on the basis that it is more likely than not that these are recoverable.
The increase principally relates to the Groups Spanish business.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 5 billion 2015: 5 billion.
A provision of 50 million 2015: 50 million has been made for taxation expected to arise on the planned future remittance of earnings totalling 1.6 billion 2015: 1.7 billion from various subsidiaries.
No liability has been recognised in respect of other differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
2 Act 2015 and the Finance Bill 2016 which is substantively enacted at the balance sheet date have reduced the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April 2020.
These proposed changes are reflected in the deferred tax balances.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES The Group operates a number of retirement benefit schemes for its employees, including both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
The Groups three principal schemes are defined benefit schemes and are operated by Imperial Tobacco Limited in the UK, Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH in Germany and ITG Brands in the USA: these schemes represent 65 per cent, 11 per cent and 7 per cent of the Groups total retirement benefit obligations and 44 per cent, 17 per cent and 11 per cent of the current service cost respectively.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO PENSION FUND The UK scheme, the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund or ITPF, is a voluntary final salary pension scheme with a normal retirement age of 60 for most members.
The ITPF was offered to employees who joined the company before 1 October 2010 and has a weighted average maturity of 20 years.
The population comprises 65 per cent in respect of pensioners, 33 per cent in respect of deferred members and 2 per cent in respect of current employees.
New employees in the UK are now offered a defined contribution scheme.
Should surplus funds arise in the defined benefit section they may be used to finance defined contribution section contributions on the Companys behalf with company contributions reduced accordingly.
The ITPF operates under trust law and is managed and administered by the Trustees on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation.
The ITPFs assets are held by the trust.
Annual increases in benefits in payment are dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable under the ITPF are future inflation levels including the impact of inflation on future salary increases and any salary increases above inflation and the actual longevity of the membership.
The contributions paid to the ITPF are set by the ITPF Scheme Actuary every three years.
The Scheme Actuary is an external consultant, appointed by the Trustees.
Principal factors that the Scheme Actuary will have regard to include the covenant offered by the Group, the level of risk in the ITPF, the expected returns on the ITPFs assets, the results of the funding assessment on an ongoing basis and the expected cost of securing benefits if the fund were to be wound up.
The latest valuation of the ITPF was carried out as at 31 March 2013 when the market value of the invested assets was 2,957 million.
Based on the ongoing funding target the total assets were sufficient to cover 100 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 90 per cent of the total benefits that had accrued to members for past service and future service benefits for current members.
In compliance with the Pensions Act 2004, Imperial Tobacco Limited and the Trustee agreed a scheme-specific funding target, a statement of funding principles and a schedule of contributions accordingly.
Following the valuation, the level of employers contributions to the scheme was increased from 31 million per year.
The Company paid 47.5 million on 31 March 2014, 52.5 million on 31 March 2015 and 57.5 million on 31 March 2016 and agreed to pay 65 million each year for the subsequent 12 years.
Further contributions were agreed to be paid by the Company in the event of a downgrade of the Groups credit rating to non-investment grade by either Standard & Poors or Moodys.
In addition, surety guarantees with a total value of 400 million and a parental guarantee with Imperial Brands PLC have been put in place.
110 Imperial Brands PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 110 Imperial Brands | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS The Scheme Actuary prepares an annual update of the funding position as at 31 March each year.
The latest actuarial valuation 31 March 2016 is currently being undertaken but the outcome of this valuation is not yet concluded.
The previous annual update at 31 March 2015 showed a surplus of 329 million in relation to past service accrued benefits.
The main risk for the Group in respect of the ITPF is that additional contributions are required if the investment returns are not sufficient to pay for the benefits which will be influenced by the factors noted above.
The level of equity returns will be a key determinant of overall investment return.
The investment portfolio is also subject to a range of other risks typical of the asset classes held, in particular exposure to equity markets, credit risk on bonds and exposure to the property market.
The IAS 19 liability measurement of the defined benefit obligation DBO and the current service cost are sensitive to the assumptions made about future inflation and salary growth levels, as well as the assumptions made about life expectation.
They are also sensitive to the discount rate, which depends on market yields on sterling denominated AA corporate bonds.
The main differences between the funding and IAS 19 assumptions are a more prudent longevity assumption for funding and a different approach to setting the discount rate.
A consequence of the ITPFs investment strategy, with a significant proportion of the assets invested in equities and other return-seeking assets, is that the difference between the market value of the assets and the IAS 19 liabilities may be relatively volatile.
THE REEMTSMA CIGARETTENFABRIKEN PENSION PLAN The German scheme, the Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken Pension Plan RCPP, is primarily a career average pension plan that is open to new entrants, though a small closed group of members has final salary benefits.
It has a weighted average maturity of 19 years.
The scheme population comprises 53 per cent in respect of pensioners, 16 per cent in respect of deferred members and 31 per cent in respect of current employees.
The plan is unfunded and the company pays benefits as they arise.
The plans obligations arise under a works council agreement and are subject to standard German legal requirements around such matters as the benefits to be provided to employees who leave service, and pension increases in payment.
Over the next year Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH expects to pay 22 million in respect of benefits.
Annual increases in benefits in payment are dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable under the plan are future inflation levels and the actual longevity of the membership.
The IAS 19 liability measurement of the DBO and the current service cost are sensitive to the assumptions made about the above variables, as well as the discount rate, which depends on market yields on euro denominated AA corporate bonds.
ITG BRANDS HOURLY PENSION PLAN The main USA pension scheme, the ITG Brands Hourly Pension Plan ITGBH, is a defined benefit pension plan that is open to new entrants.
It has a weighted average maturity of 11 years.
The population comprises 68 per cent in respect of pensioners, 4 per cent in respect of deferred members and 28 per cent in respect of current employees.
The plan is funded and benefits are paid from the plan assets.
Contributions to the plan are determined based on US regulatory requirements and ITG Brands is not expected to make any contributions in the next year.
Annual benefits in payment do not increase.
The main uncertainty affecting the level of benefits payable under the plan is the actual longevity of the membership.
Other key uncertainties impacting the plan include investment risk and potential past service benefit changes from future negotiations.
The IAS 19 liability measurement of the DBO and the service cost are sensitive to the assumptions made about the above variables, as well as the discount rate, which depends on market yields on US dollar denominated AA corporate bonds.
OTHER PLANS Other plans of the Group include various pension plans, other post-employment and long-term employee benefit plans in several countries of operation.
Many of the plans are funded, with assets backing the obligations held in separate legal vehicles such as trusts, others are operated on an unfunded basis.
The benefits provided, the approach to funding and the legal basis of the plans reflect their local territories.
IAS 19 requires that the discount rate for calculating the DBO and service cost is set according to the level of relevant market yields on corporate bonds where the market is considered deep, or government bonds where it is not.
The results of the most recent available actuarial valuations for the various plans have been updated to 30 September 2016 in order to determine the amounts to be included in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The aggregate IAS 19 position is as follows: www.

During the year ended 30 September 2016 we reached agreements in Spain with both current employees and a proportion of pensioners who would have received or had previously received payments in respect of former entitlements to free cigarettes to accept one-off cash payments in full settlement.
Payments to current employees were disbursed during the year.
The cash settlement to pensioners was paid in October 2016 and the liability was recognised in the balance sheet at 30 September 2016 in other liabilities.
Termination benefits in the year ended 30 September 2016 mainly relate to restructuring activity in Germany, the UK and the USA.
The curtailment gain arises as a result of the closure of the Mullingar factory in Ireland and restructuring activity in the USA.

An allowance for improvements in longevity is made using the CMI improvement rates with a long-term trend of 1.25 per cent per annum.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOR KEY ASSUMPTION AT THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD Sensitivity analysis is illustrative only and is provided to demonstrate the degree of sensitivity of results to key assumptions.
Generally, estimates are made by re-performing calculations with one assumption modified and all others held constant.

We estimate that a 0.5 per cent decrease increase in the discount rate at the start of the reporting period would have increased decreased the consolidated income statement pension expense by approximately 16 million.

SHARE SCHEMES The Group operates four types of share-based incentive programmes, designed to incentivise staff and to encourage them to build a stake in the Group.
SHARE MATCHING SCHEME Awards are made to eligible employees who are invited to invest a proportion of their eligible bonus in shares for a period of three years, after which matching shares are awarded on a 1:1 ratio, plus dividend equivalents.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN LTIP Awards of shares under the LTIP are made to the Executive Directors and senior executives at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
They vest three years after grant and are subject to performance criteria.
Dividend equivalents accrue on vested shares.
SHARESAVE PLAN Options are granted to eligible employees who participate in a designated savings scheme for a three year period.
Historically they were also granted for a five year period.

Awards, which are not subject to performance conditions and under which vested shares do not attract dividend roll-up, will normally vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant subject to the participants continued employment.
The limit of an award under the DSAP is capped at 25 per cent of the participants salary at the date of grant.
Shares used to settle awards under the DSAP will be market purchased.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Group is currently involved in a number of legal cases in which claimants are seeking damages for alleged smoking and health related effects.
In the opinion of the Groups lawyers, the Group has meritorious defences to these actions, all of which are being vigorously contested.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, the Directors believe that the pending actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of the operations, cash flow or financial condition of the Group.
Consequently, the Group has not provided for any amounts in respect of these cases in the financial statements.
