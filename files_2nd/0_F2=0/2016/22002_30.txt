Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 and 20% effective from 1 April 2017 and to 18% effective 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities at 2016 has been calculated based on these rates.
An additional reduction to 17% effective from 1 April 2020 was announced in the budget on 16 March 2016.
This will reduce the company's future current tax charge accordingly.
The charge for the period can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows: 2015 restated see 2016 note 2 m m Profit before tax from continuing operations: 72.2 78.3 Tax at the UK corporation tax rate of 20.08% 2015, 21.17% 14.5 16.4 Effect of change in deferred tax rate 1.2 Tax effect of expenses that are not deductible in determining taxable profit 0.4 0.5 Effect of different tax rates of subsidiaries operating in other jurisdictions 0.7 0.8 Tax effect of adjustments in respect of previous periods 4.3 0.7 Tax expense for the period 17.3 16.8 In addition to the amount charged to the income statement, tax movements recognised directly through equity were as follows: 2016 2015 Tax recognised in other comprehensive income m m Deferred tax retirement benefit obligations 2.5 0.3 Tax charge in the statement of comprehensive income 2.5 0.3 2016 2015 Tax recognised in equity m m Current tax share based payments 0.2 0.8 Deferred tax share based payments 1.7 1.9 Tax charge in the statement of changes in equity 1.5 1.1 N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 97 NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 11 Tax continued The Group has on-going discussions with HMRC in respect of open taxation positions.
The calculation of the Group's potential liabilities or assets in respect of these involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with HMRC or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
Issues can, and often do, take a number of years to resolve.
The amounts recognised or disclosed are derived from the Group's best estimation and judgement and, where appropriate, legal counsel's opinion has been sought.
However the inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of these means eventual realisation could differ from the accounting estimates and therefore impact the Group's results and cash flows.

No amortisation is charged on these assets.
All software additions relate to internal development.
Impairment testing of Software intangible assets The Group is currently undertaking a Systems transformation project.
Fit 4 the Future, Elements of Fit 4 the Future are not yet available for use therefore management have conducted impairment testing as at 27 February 2016.
The recoverable amount has been based on the present value of future cashflows using the following key assumptions: Cash flows over the seven year useful economic life of the asset represent managements best estimate of future cash flows as at 27 February 2016, and are based upon the Groups forecasts for 2017 2023.
The main assumptions underlying the cashflows relate to improvements in buying, marketing and credit management due to the use of an integrated platform as well as changes in costs due to reductions in finance time, and will be driven by exploitation of the Groups new IT platform and further investments made during 2017.
Cash flows into perpetuity have not been incorporated into the calculation for prudence, however the asset is expected to generate economic benefit for the Group significantly past 2023.
A pre-tax discount rate of 8% has been used in the forecast, consistent with the Brand impairment testing performed.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets exceeds their carrying value and as such, no impairment was identified.
It is on this basis, that management do not consider an impairment to exist at 27 February 2016.
No reasonably possible change in a key assumption on which management has based its determination of the assets recoverable amount would cause the assets carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
The amortisation periods for intangible assets are: Years F4F Development Project 7 Software 5 Customer Database 5 Impairment testing of Brand intangibles The brand names arising from the acquisition of High and Mighty, Slimma, Figleaves, Diva and Dannimac are deemed to have indefinite lives as there are no foreseeable limits to the periods over which they are expected to generate cash inflows and are subject to annual impairment tests.
As a result of the decision to close the Gray & Osbourn catalogue business in 2015 the carrying value of the brand was permanently impaired to a value of nil.
The carrying value of the brand names have been determined from a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions for this calculation are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and the forecast cash flows.
N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 99 NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 14 Intangible assets continued The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the most recent three year financial budgets approved by management and thereafter extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity with 2.7% growth assumed to reflect that there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which cash flows are expected to be generated.
The rate used to discount the forecast pre-tax cash flows is 8.0% 2015, 7.4%.
The directors consider that the value in use calculation has sufficient headroom above the carrying value of the brand names.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed with both the growth rate and discount rate adjusted by 7%, and under these sensitivities significant headroom is maintained.
The carrying value in relation to Gray & Osbourn is nil 2015, nil, 7.1m 2015, 7.1m for Figleaves and for High and Mighty is 1.0m 2015, 1.0m.
Whilst the directors do not consider that either brand name is impaired as at the balance sheet date, should there be a downturn in future or forecasted cashflows, then there is a risk of impairment to these brand names.

Interest is charged at 58.7% 2015, 58.7% on the outstanding balance.
Where there is objective evidence of financial difficulty, a provision of estimated irrecoverable amounts is determined by reference to past default experience.
A provision is held for all trade receivables that reach the trigger point of 56 days past due.
For customers who find themselves in financial difficulties, the Group may offer revised payment terms to support the customer, encouraging customer rehabilitation and thereby maximising long term returns.
However as the customer is not meeting their original payment terms a provision is held for these receivables.
Generally, receivables over 150 days past due are written off in full.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customers credit quality and defines credit limits by customer.
Credit limits and scores attributed to customers are reviewed every 28 days.
The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired, with regard to the historical default rate has remained stable.

The Group continues to be in discussion with HMRC in relation to the VAT consequences of the allocation of marketing costs between our retail and credit businesses.
At this stage it is not possible to determine how the matter will be resolved.
However within our year end VAT debtor is an asset of 21.7m which has arisen as a result of cash payments made under protective assessments raised by HMRC.
Based on legal counsel's opinion, we believe that we will recover this amount in full from HMRC and we are engaged in a legal process to do so.
Other debtors and prepayments do not include impaired assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of asset.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

Bank overdrafts which are nil at the current and prior year ends are repayable on demand, unsecured and bear interest at a margin over bank base rates.
The Group has a bank loan of 250m 2015, 250m secured by a charge over certain eligible trade debtors current and 028 days past due of the Group and is without recourse to any of the Groups other assets.
The facility has a current limit of 280m for which finance costs are linked to US commercial paper rates which is committed until August 2020.
The Group also has unsecured bank loans of 85m 2015, 37m drawn down under a medium term bank revolving credit facility, of 125 million, which is committed until September 2020. iii.
All borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group may use derivatives such as interest rate swaps where appropriate to manage this risk.
None have been used in the current or prior year.
Based on weighted average interest rates and the value of bank loans at 27 February 2016 the estimated future interest cost per annum until maturity would be 2.3m 2015, 2.0m.

Financial risk management objectives The financial risks facing the Group include currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of certain of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures as governed by the Groups policies.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 103 NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 21 Financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments for the purchase of overseas sourced products.
Group policy allows for these exposures to be hedged for up to three years ahead.

N Brown Group plc 104 Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial statements Interest rate sensitivity analysis If interest rates had increased by 0.5% and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit before tax for the 52 weeks ended 27 February 2016 would have decreased by 1.4m 2015, 1.4m.
This sensitivity analysis has been determined based on exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date and assuming the net debt outstanding at the year end date was outstanding for the whole year.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group.
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative financial instruments are made through banks which are approved by the board.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures, supplied by independent rating agencies.
Customer debtor balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate banking and borrowing facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in note 19 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal and details of the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.

The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at the amortised cost in the financial statements approximate to their fair values, with the exception of trade receivables.
As discussed in Note 18, where a customer finds themselves in financial difficulty, we may offer revised payment terms.
This maximises long term returns to the business, but may not maximise the present value of the receivable.
Therefore, the Group believes the amortised cost does not reflect the fair value of these receivables, which we have calculated as 554.0m.

N Brown Group plc 108 Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial statements The fair value of management and sharesave options awards granted is calculated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 2016 2015 Weighted average share price at date of grant pence 339 441 Weighted average exercise price pence 97 193 Expected volatility % 27.7 34.2 26.0 36.2 Expected life years 2.5 5.5 2.5 5.5 Risk-free rate % 0.9 1.2 Dividend yield % 4.2 3.4 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over a period equivalent to theexpected life of the option.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, forthe effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of 2.2m and 2.1m related to equity-settled share based payment transactions in 2016 and2015 respectively.
30 Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees.
The Group is required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits.
The only obligation of the Group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of 3.1m 2015, 3.3m represents contributions payable to the schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
As at 27 February 2016, contributions of 0.3m 2015, 0.4m due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme The Group operates a defined benefit scheme, the N Brown Group Pension Fund.
Under the scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final pensionable earnings and was closed to new members from 31 January 2002.
On 29 February 2016 the scheme was closed to future accrual.
A past service credit in respect of this closure has been recognised in 2016, as the company was both committed to the change, and had the right to apply the change by the balance sheet date.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The scheme is a funded scheme and operates under UK trust law and the trust is a separate legal entity from the Group.
The scheme is governed by a board of trustees.
The trustees are required by law to act in the best interests of scheme members and are responsible for setting certain policies eg investment funding together with the Group.
The scheme exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and investment risk.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 30June 2012 by an independent qualified actuary.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in determining the Groups net retirement benefit obligations at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2016 2015 Discount rate 3.90% 3.50% Future pension increases 2.15% 2.12% Inflation Retail Price Index 3.15% 3.25% Inflation Consumer Price Index 2.15% 2.25% Life expectancy at age 65 years Pensioner aged 65 24.6 24.6 Non-pensioner aged 45 26.7 26.7 N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 109 NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 30 Retirement benefit schemes continued Amounts recognised in income in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Current service cost 2.3 2.2 Past service cost 2.4 Net interest cost 0.1 0.2 2.4 The actual return on scheme assets was 3.7m 2015, 21.5m.
The amount included in the balance sheet arising from the groups obligations in respect of its defined benefit retirement benefit scheme is as follows: 2016 2015 m m Present value of defined benefit obligations 108.1 120.8 Fair value of scheme assets 118.9 117.5 Surplus deficit in the scheme and liability recognised in the balance sheet 10.8 3.3 The surplus reflects the economic benefit at the balance sheet date, that the Group would be entitled to Group, through refund, in the event the Scheme was wound up.
Movements in the present value of defined benefit obligations were as follows: 2016 2015 m m At 28 February 2015 120.8 100.8 Current service cost 2.3 2.2 Past service cost 2.4 Interest cost 4.2 4.3 Remeasurement gain loss a.

Effect of experience adjustments 2.8 c. Benefits paid 3.9 2.5 At 27 February 2016 108.1 120.8 Movements in the fair value of the scheme assets were as follows: 2016 2015 m m At 28 February 2015 117.5 96.6 Interest income 4.1 4.1 Return on scheme assets excluding interest income 0.4 17.4 Contributions from sponsoring companies 1.6 1.9 Benefits paid 3.9 2.5 At 27 February 2016 118.9 117.5 N Brown Group plc 110 Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial statements The analysis of the scheme assets at the balance sheet date was as follows: 2016 2015 m % m % Equities 33.8 28.4 37.4 31.8 Fixed-interest government bonds 14.8 12.4 18.0 15.3 Index-linked government bonds 29.1 24.5 29.5 25.1 Corporate Bonds 14.6 12.3 12.5 10.6 Property 2.2 1.9 2.1 1.8 Growth fixed income 13.2 11.1 9.7 8.3 Alternatives 10.9 9.2 6.9 5.9 Cash and cash equivalents 0.3 0.2 1.4 1.2 118.9 100.0 117.5 100.0 Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are the discount rate and inflation.
An increase of 0.25% in the discount rate used would decrease the defined benefit obligation by 5.8m 2015, 7.0m.
An increase of 0.25% in the inflation assumption would increase the defined benefit obligation by 4.4m 2015, 4.7m.
The above sensitivities are applied to adjust the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period.
Whilst the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows under the scheme, it does provide an approximation to the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.
No changes have been made to the method and assumptions used in this analysis from those used in the previous period.
The scheme is funded by the group and current employee members.
Funding the scheme is based on a separate actuarial valuation for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ from the assumptions above.
Funding requirements are formally set out in the Statement of Funding Principles, Schedule of Contributions and Recovery Plan agreed between the trustees and the Group.
Whilst no commitment has been made as at the balance sheet date, the Group expects to contribute 0.2m 2015, 1.8m to the defined benefit scheme in the next financial year.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 27 February 2016 is approximately 24 years 2015, 24 years.
The defined benefit obligation at 27 February 2016 can be approximately attributed to the scheme members as follows: Active members: 0% 2015, 44% Deferred members: 68% 2015, 36% Pensioner members: 32% 2015, 20% All benefits are vested at 27 February 2016 unchanged from 28 February 2015.
31 Related party transactions Transactions between the company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
