Share based payments On 28 September 2015, certain key management personnel employed by the Company and its subsidiary undertakings were granted share awards conditional upon the Company listing on the London Stock Exchange.
The awards are for a fixed cash value of 5.9m payable in Ordinary Shares at or shortly before 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018, based on the market value of the Companys Ordinary Shares at that date, and will be Ordinary Shares of the same class as those Ordinary Shares listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The awards have no performance conditions attached, other than the requirement for the members to remain in service until vesting, not be subject to gross misconduct and other similar exceptions.
In the event that the Board determines that the market price of Ordinary Shares has fallen materially since the grant of the awards, the Board may reduce the value of the awards at the time that they become payable.
The estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date, taking into account the fixed price of the award and the period to vesting was 4.9m.
The awards are classified as equity settled share based payments and at 31 December 2015, no awards had vested.
For the period ended 31 December 2016, costs of 0.7m relating to employees of the Company were recognised as employee expenses within profit or loss 2015: 0.3m.
Costs of 1.7m relating to employees within the subsidiary undertakings, were recognised as an increase in the investment in subsidiary 2015: 0.2m, with a corresponding 2.4m credit to retained earnings 2015: 0.5m.
