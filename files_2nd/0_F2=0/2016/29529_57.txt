SEGMENTAL INFORMATION The Groups segmental reporting is in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments and is reported consistently with the internal performance framework and as presented to the Groups Management Team.
The four client segments are Corporate & Institutional Banking, Private Banking, Commercial Banking and Retail Banking.
The four geographic regions are Greater China & North Asia, ASEAN & South Asia, Africa & Middle East, and Europe & America.
Activities not directly related to a client segment and or geographic region is included in Central & other items.
This mainly includes Corporate Centre costs, Asset and Liability Management, treasury activities, certain strategic investments and the UK bank levy.
The following should also be noted: Transactions and funding between the segments are carried out on an arms-length basis Corporate Centre costs represent stewardship and central management services roles and activities that are not directly attributable to business or country operations Asset and Liability Management, joint ventures and associate investments are managed in the regions and are included within the applicable region.
However, they are not managed directly by a client segment and therefore included in the Central & other items segment In addition to treasury activities, Corporate Centre costs and other Group related functions, Central & other items for regions includes globally run businesses or activities that are managed by the client segments but not directly by geographic management.
These include Principal Finance and Portfolio Management The Group allocates central costs excluding Corporate Centre costs relating to client segments and geographic regions using appropriate business drivers and these are reported within operating expenses.
An analysis of the Groups performance by client segment and region is set out on pages 30 and 53.
Basis of preparation The analysis reflects how the client segments and geographic regions are managed internally.
This is described as the Management View and is principally the location from which a client relationship is managed, which may differ from where it is financially booked and may be shared between businesses and or regions.
In certain instances this approach is not appropriate and a Financial View is disclosed, that is, the location in which the transaction or balance was booked.
Typically the Financial View is used in areas such as the Market and Liquidity Risk reviews where actual location is more important for an assessment.
Segmental information is therefore on a Management View unless otherwise stated.
