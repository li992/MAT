Financial statements Notes forming part of the financial statements 1.
"Significant accounting policies Pets at Home Group Plc ""the Company"" is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom and its registered office is Epsom Avenue, Stanley Green, Handforth, Cheshire, SK9 3RN."
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financialstatements.
1.1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements presented in this document have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments to fair value, and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
New standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC becoming effective during the year have not had a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
1.2 Measurement convention The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments, financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss or as available-for-sale.
Non-current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
1.3 Going concern The Companys business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the Strategic Report.
The financial position of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Chief Financial Officers Review.
In addition, note 22 to the financial statements includes the Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Company has considerable financial resources and financing facilities and prepares detailed business plans that model headroom on financial covenants.
The Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully and therefore have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
1.4 Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Investment in veterinary practices The Group has a number of non-participatory shareholdings in veterinary practice companies, which are accounted for as joint venture arrangements.
The veterinary practices were established under terms that require mutual agreement between the Group and the joint venture partner, and that do not give the Group power over decision making to affect its exposure to, or the extent of, the returns from its involvement with the practices and therefore are not consolidated in these financial statements.
Further, the Group is not entitled to profit, losses, or any surplus on winding up or disposal of the veterinary practices, and as such no participatory interest is recognised.
1.5 Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement, except for differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation that is effective, or qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
Pets at Home Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 121 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the Groups presentational currency, sterling, at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve or non-controlling interest, as the case may be.
Functional currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling which is the Companys functional currency and have been rounded to the nearest thousand.
1.6 Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: a they include no contractual obligations upon the Company or Group as the case may be to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company or Group : and b where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company's exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
1.7 Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Investments in debt and equity securities Other investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in equity in the fair value reserve, except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary items such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses.
When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss.
Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the cash flow statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Contingent consideration Contingent consideration on acquisition of a subsidiary is valued at fair value at the time of acquisition.
Any subsequent change in fair value is recognised in profit or loss.
Pets at Home Group Plc 122 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements 1.8 Derivative financial instruments and hedging Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged see below.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss, i. e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
1.9 Intra-group financial instruments Financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of companies within the Group are considered to be insurance arrangements and accounted for as such.
In this respect, the Group treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that a payment will be required under the guarantee.
1.10 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold property 50 years Motor vehicles 3 years Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 310 years Leasehold improvements the term of the lease Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Pets at Home Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 123 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued 1.11 Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Acquisitions on or after 26 March 2010 For acquisitions on or after 26 March 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
A combined put and call option over non-controlling interests is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and included within the valuation of goodwill.
Subsequent changes to fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
On a  basis, the Group elects to measure non-controlling interests, which have both present ownership interests and are entitled to a proportionate share of net assets of the acquiree in the event of liquidation, either at their fair value or at their proportionate interest in the recognised amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date.
All other non-controlling interests are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Acquisitions prior to 26 March 2010 date of adoption of IFRSs IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of Adopted IFRSs for first time adopters.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 26 March 2010, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost.
1.12 Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.
The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.
Any difference between the price paid or received and the amount by which non-controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.
1.13 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition, less rebates and discounts.
1.14 Impairment excluding inventories, and deferred tax assets Financial assets including receivables A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired.
A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the assets original effective interest rate.
Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount.
When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Pets at Home Group Plc 124 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each period at the same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets the cash-generating unit.
The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs.
Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit or group of units on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
1.15 Employee benefits Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
Short-term benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share based payments A number of employees of the Companys subsidiaries including Directors receive an element of remuneration in the form of share based payments, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
Share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of transactions involving the granting of shares is determined by the share price at the date of grant.
The fair value of transactions involving the granting of share options is calculated by an external valuer based on a binomial model.
In valuing share based payments, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Pets at Home Group Plc market conditions.
The cost of share based payments is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Companys estimate of how many of the awards will eventually vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of a share based payment award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of the modification.
Where a share based payment award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification to the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.

Significant accounting policies continued 1.16 Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
1.17 Revenue and cost of sales Revenue represents the total amount receivable for goods and services, net of discounts and excluding value added tax, sold in the ordinary course of business, and arises from activities in the United Kingdom.
Revenue is recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, there is reasonable certainty over recovery of the consideration and the amount of revenue, associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably.
Revenue is recognised when transactions are completed in store or online.
Sale of goods in store and online Retail revenue from the sale of goods is recorded net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers.
Sale of goods represents food and accessories sold in store and online, with revenue recognised at the point of sale.
VIP loyalty scheme Under the VIP loyalty scheme, points are earned by customers upon the purchase of goods and services.
These points can be converted by nominated charities into gift cards for redemption against goods and services in store and online.
The sales value of the points earned under the VIP scheme are treated as deferred income: the sales are only recognised once the points have been redeemed by the charities.
Provision of services Revenue from the provision of services is recorded net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers.
Provision of services represents veterinary group income, grooming revenue and insurance commissions, with revenue recognised upon provision of the service.
i Veterinary group income Veterinary group income represents revenue from the provision of veterinary services and income from the provision of veterinary administrative support services.
Revenue received for the provision of veterinary services is recognised at the point of provision of the service and is recognised net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers.
Fee income received from the joint venture veterinary practice companies for administrative support services is recognised in the period the services relate to and recorded net of value added tax.
ii Grooming revenue Grooming revenue is recognised net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers, at the point of provision of the service.
Cost of sales Cost of sales includes costs of goods sold and other directly attributable costs and promotional income received from suppliers, including costs to deliver administrative support services to joint venture veterinary practices and costs to deliver grooming services.
Exceptional items Income or costs that are both material and non-recurring, whose significance is sufficient to warrant separate disclosure in the consolidated financial statements, are referred to as exceptional items.
These are included and separately identified within their relevant income statement category.
Supplier income A number of different types of supplier income are negotiated with suppliers via the joint business planning process, in connection with the purchase of goods for resale.
The supplier income arrangements typically are not co-terminus with the Groups financial period, instead running alongside the calendar year.
Such income is only recognised when there is reasonable certainty that the conditions for recognition have been met by the Group, and the income can be measured reliably based on the terms of the contract.
This income is recognised as a credit within gross margin and, to the extent that the rebate relates to unsold stock purchases, as a reduction in the cost of inventory.
Supplier income comprises three main elements: 1.
Fixed percentage based income: These relate largely to volumetric rebates based on the joint business plan agreements with suppliers.
The income accrued is based on the Groups latest forecast volumes and the latest contract agreed with the supplier.
Income is not recognised until the Group has reasonable certainty that the joint business agreement will be fulfilled, with the amount of income accrued regularly re-assessed and re-measured throughout the contractual period, based on actual performance against the joint business plan.
Fixed lump sum income: These are typically guaranteed lump sum payments made by the supplier and are not based on volume.
Fixed lump sum income is usually predicated on confirmation of a supplier contract and typically includes performance conditions upon the Group, such as marketing and promotional campaigns.
These amounts are recognised periodically based on the most recent assessment of contractual performance.
Pets at Home Group Plc 126 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements 3.
Growth income: These are tiered volumetric rebates relating to growth targets agreed with the supplier in the joint business planning process.
These are retrospective rebates based on sales volumes or purchased volumes.
Income is recognised to the extent that it is reasonably certain that the conditions will be achieved, with such certainty increasing in the latter part of the calendar year.
Supplier income is recognised on an accruals basis, based on the expected entitlement that has been earned up to the balance sheet date for each relevant supplier contract.
The accrued incentives, rebates and discounts receivable at year end are included within trade and other receivables.
1.18 Expenses Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement over the term of the lease as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Financing income and expenses Financing expenses comprise interest payable under the effective interest rate method, incorporating amortisation of loan arrangement fees, finance charges on shares classified as liabilities and finance leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, unwinding of the discount on provisions and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the income statement see foreign currency accounting policy.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that takes a substantial time to be prepared for use, are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.
Financing income comprises interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, and net foreign exchange gains.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entitys right to receive payment is established.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
Other payables Lease incentives are received in the form of cash contributions and rent free periods.
Cash contributions from landlords for store fit-outs are initially recognised as a liability in the balance sheet at the point the recognition criteria in the lease is met and credited to selling and distribution expenses in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease commencing from access date.
Cash contributions are not discounted.
Rent free periods received from landlords are initially recognised as a liability on the balance sheet, which is then credited to the selling and distribution expenses in the consolidated income statement over the life of the lease.
The effect is to recognise a reduction in selling and distribution expenses on a straight-line basis from property access date to the end of the lease.
Rent free periods are not discounted.
1.19 Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.

1.21 Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning the future that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
These judgements are based on historical experience and managements best knowledge at the time and the actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The estimates and assumptions that have significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed below.
Carrying value of inventories The managers review the market value of and demand for inventories on a periodic basis to ensure inventory is recorded in the financial statements at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Any provision for impairment is recorded against the carrying value of inventories.
The managers use their knowledge of market conditions to assess future demand for the Groups products and achievable selling prices.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles Determining whether goodwill and other intangibles are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Details of CGUs as well as further information about the assumptions made are disclosed in note 10.
Assumptions relating to tax The Group recognises expected assets for tax based on an estimation of the likely taxes receivable, which requires significant judgement as to the ultimate tax determination of certain items.
Where the actual asset arising from these issues differs from these estimates, such differences will have an impact on income tax and deferred tax assets in the period when such determination is made.
Provisions Provisions have been made for dilapidations and for closed stores.
Information about provisions and contingencies, which are considered to have a risk of material adjustment in the next financial period due to the assumptions and estimations used, are disclosed in note 20.
The provisions are based on historical experience and managements best knowledge at the time and are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
The actual costs and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events.
Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period when such determination is made.
1.22 Dividends Final dividends are recognised in the Groups financial statements as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders such that the Company is obliged to pay the dividend.
Interim equity dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
Pets at Home Group Plc 128 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements 2.
Segmental reporting The Directors consider there to be one operating and reportable segment, being that of the sale of pet products and services through retail outlets, specialist vet referral services and the Groups websites.
The Groups Board receives monthly financial information at this level and uses this information to monitor the performance of the store portfolio, allocate resources and make operational decisions.
The internal reporting received focuses on the Group as a whole and does not identify individual segments.
To increase transparency, the Group has decided to include an additional voluntary disclosure analysing revenue within the reportable segment.

Acquisition of Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists Ltd On 18 January 2016, the Group acquired 75% of the total share capital of Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists Ltd in exchange for cash and contingent consideration.
The remaining share capital of Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists Ltd is held by non-controlling interests.
A put and call option, written into the Articles of Association, allows the non-controlling shareholders to require sale of their shares to the Group at an agreed pricing method at certain points in the future.
The Articles also contain provision for the Group to buy the non-controlling shares under the same pricing mechanism at certain times.
As a consequence, the put and call option has been treated as a forward contract and as a result, the financial statements are prepared on the basis that the Group owns 100% of the total share capital of Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists Ltd.
Therefore no non-controlling interest is recognised.
The deemed value of the put and call option is treated as a forward contract.

The business combination includes an element of consideration payable on satisfaction of certain performance conditions in the period to 31 March 2018.
The forecast contingent consideration payable, based on the Directors best estimate of performance at the time of acquisition, in the future period, is 1,000,000.
Assets acquired and liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition The provisional amounts recognised in respect of identifiable assets and liabilities relating to the acquisition are as follows: Accounting Assets and Carrying policy Fair value liabilities amounts adjustments adjustments acquired 000 000 000 000 Current assets Cash and cash equivalents 1,733 1,733 Trade and other receivables 300 10 290 Inventories 228 228 Non-current assets Tangible fixed assets 810 3 807 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 1,051 1,051 Deferred tax liabilities 114 114 1,906 13 1,893 Provisional goodwill arising on acquisition Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists Ltd 000 Consideration transferred 7,525 Contingent consideration 1,000 Forward contract 4,117 Less: fair value of net assets acquired 1,893 Goodwill arising on acquisition 10,749 Goodwill arose on the acquisition of Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists Ltd because the cost of the combination included a control premium in addition to the consideration paid for the combination, effectively including amounts in relation to the benefits of expected synergies, revenue growth and future market development.
Those benefits are not recognised separately from goodwill because they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets.
The goodwill is deemed to be provisional due to the timing of the acquisition in relation to the period end.
It is considered that further information could come to light that could affect the fair value of net assets acquired.
None of the goodwill identified on this acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

The Group is deemed to have one overall group of CGUs as follows: Goodwill At 31 March At 26 March 2016 2015 000 000 Pets at Home Group 965,925 952,032 The recoverable amount of the CGU group has been calculated with reference to its value in use.
The key assumptions of this calculation are shown below: At 31 March At 26 March 2016 2015 Period on which management approved forecasts are based years 3 3 Growth rate applied beyond approved forecast period 3% 3% Discount rate pre-tax 10% 9% The goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and the recoverable amount is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use a pre-tax cash flow projection based on a three year plan approved by the Board.
The key assumptions in this business plan are like-for-like sales growth, and gross and operating profit margins.
The forecast assumptions reflect continual innovation, our deep understanding of our customers and a detailed analysis of geographic opportunities that allow us to continue to grow.
The projections are based on all available information and growth rates do not exceed growth rates achieved in prior periods.
A different set of assumptions may be more appropriate in future years depending on changes in the macro-economic environment.
The discount rate was estimated based on past experience and industry average weighted average cost of capital.
The Directors have assumed a growth rate projection beyond the three year period based on inflationary increases.
The total recoverable amount in respect of goodwill for the CGU group as assessed by the managers using the above assumptions is greater than the carrying amount and therefore no impairment charge has been booked in each period.
The Directors consider that it is not reasonably possible for the assumptions to change so significantly as to eliminate the excess.

A provision is made where the rent receivable on the properties is less than the rent payable, or where management consider there to be a risk on the sublet.
The timing of the utilisation of these provisions is variable dependent upon the lease expiry dates of the properties concerned, which vary between 10 and 15 years.
Market conditions have a significant impact and hence the assumptions on future cash flows are reviewed regularly and revisions to the provision made where necessary.
The Company did not hold any provisions at 31 March 2016 or 26 March 2015.

Financial instruments Financial risk management The Pets at Home Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Risk management framework Risk management in respect of financial risk is carried out by the Pets at Home Group Treasury Function under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Board provides written principles, through its Group Treasury Policy, for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
The main objectives of the Pets at Home Group Treasury Function are: To ensure shareholder and management expectations are managed on cash flow and earnings volatility resulting from financial market movements To protect the expected cash flow and earnings from interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations to within parameters acceptable to the Board and shareholders To control banking costs and service levels Market risk i Foreign currency risk The Pets at Home Group sources a significant level of purchases in foreign currency, in excess of US $50 million each financial year, and monitors its foreign currency requirements through short, medium and long term cash flow forecasting.
The value of purchases in US dollars continues to increase each year and the risk management policy has evolved with this increased risk.
At 31 March 2016, the Pets at Home Groups policy is to hedge between 75% and 90% of the forecast foreign exchange transactions on a rolling 10 to 12 month basis, using foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The transactions are deemed to be highly probable and are based on historical knowledge and forecast purchase and sales projections.
Pets at Home Group Plc 146 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk is as follows.
This is based on the carrying amount for monetary financial instruments, except for derivatives which are based on notional amounts: 31 March 2016 Euro US Dollar HKD Total 000 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 4 2 6 Trade payables 516 2,229 2,745 Forward exchange contracts 118 1,172 1,290 Balance sheet exposure 394 1,057 2 1,449 26 March 2015 Euro US Dollar HKD Total 000 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 293 2,523 2 2,818 Trade payables 446 5,178 5,624 Forward exchange contracts 120 1,817 1,697 Balance sheet exposure 273 838 2 1,109 Sensitivity analysis A 5% weakening of the following currencies against the pound sterling at the period end date in both years would have increased decreased profit or loss or equity by the amounts shown below.
This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates and interest rates, remain constant.
Equity Profit or loss 31 March 2016 26 March 2015 31 March 2016 26 March 2015 000 000 000 000 US Dollar 59 91 111 133 Euro 6 6 26 8 A 5% strengthening of the above currencies against the pound sterling in any period would have had the equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
ii Interest rate risk Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The Pets at Home Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
As at 31 March 2016 the Group had a senior facility with a face value totalling 202.0m.
The Pets at Home Groups borrowings as at 31 March 2016 incur interest at a rate of 1.5% plus LIBOR at current leverage, which exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The analysis of loan repayments is detailed in note 18.
The Pets at Home Groups policy with regard to interest rate risk is to hedge the appropriate level of borrowings by entering into fixed rate agreements.
The Pets at Home Group has entered into two fixed rate interest rate swap agreements over a total of 150m of the senior facility borrowings at the balance sheet date at a fixed rate of 1.087%.
Both swaps expire on 30 March 2017.
A further swap was taken out over 85m of the borrowings to cover the year commencing 31 March 2017 at a fixed rate of 1.639%.
The hedges are structured to hedge at least 70% of the forecast outstanding debt for the next year.

Financial instruments continued Profile At the balance sheet date the interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments was: Group Company Book value Book value Book value Book value At 31 March At 26 March At 31 March At 26 March 2016 2015 2016 2015 000 000 000 000 Fixed rate instruments Financial liabilities 149,091 316,875 149,091 316,875 Variable rate instruments Financial liabilities 52,000 3,799 52,000 3,799 Total financial liabilities 201,091 320,674 201,091 320,674 All borrowings bear a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR.
Pets at Home Group policy is to hedge at least 70% of the loan to ensure a fixed rate of interest.
Therefore, designated above is the portion of the loan hedged by a fixed rate interest rate swap and the remaining un-hedged portion is designated as variable rate.
Sensitivity analysis A change of 50 basis points in interest rates at the period end date would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant and considers the effect of financial instruments with variable interest rates, financial instrument at fair value through profit or loss or available for sale with fixed interest rates and the fixed rate element of interest rate swaps.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for the comparative period.
At 31 March At 26 March 2016 2015 000 000 Equity Increase 745 1,584 Decrease 745 1,584 Profit or loss Increase 260 19 Decrease 260 19 Credit risk Financial risk management Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
The Group ensures that the banks used for the financing of the loan facilities and interest rate swap agreements hold an acceptable risk rating by independent parties.
The Group has in place certain guarantees over the bank loans taken out by a number of veterinary practice companies in which it holds an investment.
Further details of these guarantees are disclosed in note 26.
The performance of the veterinary practice companies is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Exposure to credit risk The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk, being the carrying amount of financial assets, is summarised in the table within the fair values section below.
Pets at Home Group Plc 148 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Management prepares and monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups cash balances based on expected cash flows to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without risking damage to the Groups reputation.
Covenants are monitored on a regular basis to ensure there is no risk or breach which would lead to an Event of Default and compliance certificates are issued as required to the syndicate agent.

Trade and other payables and receivables The fair value of these items is considered to be its carrying value as the impact of discounting future cash flows has been assessed as not material.
Cash and cash equivalents The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is repayable on demand.
Where it is not repayable on demand such as term deposits, then the fair value is estimated at the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date.
Long-term and short-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates its carrying value as it has an interest rate based on LIBOR.

Financial instruments continued Short-term deposits The fair value of short term deposits is considered to be their carrying value as the balances are held in floating rate accounts where the interest rate is reset to market rates.
Derivative financial instruments The fair value of interest rate swap contracts and forward exchange contracts is calculated by management based on external valuations received from the Groups bankers and is based on forward exchange rates and anticipated future interest yield respectively.
Any subsequent changes in fair values are recognised in profit or loss.
Put and call options over non-controlling interests Put and call options over non-controlling interests are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and included within the valuation of goodwill.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes appropriate decisions in light of the current economic conditions and strategic objectives of the Group.
The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the Group.
The funding requirements of the Group are met by the utilisation of external borrowings together with available cash, as detailed in note 18.
A key objective of the Groups capital management is to maintain compliance with the covenants set out in the Senior Financing Facilities and to maintain a comfortable level of headroom over and above these requirements.
Management have continued to measure and monitor covenant compliance throughout the period and the Group has complied with the requirements set.
Share based payments At 31 March 2016, the Group has four share award plans all of which are equity settled schemes.

d Performance, vesting and performance adjustment The Matching Awards granted on 17 March 2014 vest subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions outlined below.
To the extent that any future awards are granted, different conditions may apply in the absolute discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The performance conditions are as follows: 75% of the Matching Award will be subject to the CAGR in the Companys earnings per share EPS over three financial years, namely FY15, FY16 and FY17 together the Performance Period which, for the avoidance of doubt, ends on 30 March 2017.
If the CAGR in the Companys EPS is 10%, then 10% of the total Matching Award will vest.
If the CAGR in the Companys EPS is 17.5% or more, then 75% of the total Matching Award will vest.
Vesting will be on a straight-line basis between these two points.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the CAGR in EPS is less than 10% over the Performance Period then the amount of the Matching Award which will vest under this EPS performance condition will be nil.
25% of the total Matching Award will be subject to the Companys total shareholder return TSR as compared to a comparator group made up of a selected group of retail companies over the Performance Period.
Vesting of 6.25% of the total Matching Award will occur for median performance.
Vesting of the maximum 25% of the total Matching Award will occur for upper quartile performance or above.
Vesting will occur on a straight-line basis between these two points.
If the Companys TSR performance over the Performance Period is below median, then the amount of the Matching Award which will vest under this TSR performance condition will be nil.
To the extent vested as to performance, Matching Awards will become exercisable in three equal amounts on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of 17 March 2014, but subject to continued employment with the Group.

Part I of the CSOP is tax approved under Schedule 4 to the Income Tax Earnings and Pensions Act 2003 and provides for the grant of tax approved options.
Part II of the CSOP provides for the grant of unapproved options.
The tax approved options under Part I of the CSOP will be exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment with the Group.
These awards will be granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the shares at the grant date as agreed with HMRC.
a Eligibility All colleagues, including the Executive Directors and Senior Executives, are eligible to participate in the CSOP, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
b Grant of options No options may be granted more than ten years after the adoption of the CSOP.
Options under the CSOP will not form part of a colleagues pensionableearnings.

Share based payments continued e Individual limits No option may be granted to an eligible colleague under Part I of the CSOP which would result in the aggregate exercise prices of shares comprised in all outstanding options granted to him her under Part I, when aggregated with outstanding options held under any other tax approved executive share option scheme established by the Company, exceeding the tax approved limit currently 30,000.
In addition, both under Part I and II of the CSOP the aggregate exercise price of shares comprised in options granted to a colleague under the CSOP and the PSP in any financial year shall not exceed 150% of his her annual salary for that year.
For the purposes of these limits, market value will be calculated by reference to the market value of the shares on or prior to the relevant date of grant as determined by the Board following consultation with the Remuneration Committee and subject to HMRC approval if applicable.
l Part II Part II of the CSOP provides for the grant of unapproved options.
This enables options to be granted under the same terms as Part I of the CSOP but without complying with the particular requirements of the legislation applicable to tax approved CSOP Schemes.
The provisions of the CSOP that do not apply under Part II include the 30,000 limit and the need to seek HMRC approval for the scheme and subsequent amendments as applicable.
PSP On 25 February 2014 the Company adopted the PSP.
Awards under the PSP were made on 17 March 2014 and annually thereafter and will be exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of this date, subject to continued employment with the Group and the satisfaction of performance conditions.
a Eligibility Only the Executive Directors, the Senior Executives and certain other senior colleagues selected to participate in the PSP.
b Grant of awards Awards under the PSP will not form part of a colleagues pensionable earnings.
Awards are not transferable other than on death without the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
c Exercise price The price at which a colleague may acquire shares on the exercise or vesting of an award under the PSP shall be determined by the Remuneration Committee on the date of grant, and may, if the Remuneration Committee determines, be nil or nominal value only.
d Scheme limits The number of newly issued shares over which or in respect of which awards may be granted under the PSP on any date shall be limited so that: i the total number of shares issued and issuable in respect of options or awards granted in any ten year period under the PSP and any other discretionary share option scheme of the Company including the CIP and the CSOP but other than to satisfy dividend equivalent payments is restricted to 5% of the Companys issued shares calculated at the relevant time: and ii the total number of shares issued and issuable pursuant to options or awards granted in any ten year period under the PSP and any other employee share scheme operated by the Company including the CIP, CSOP, SAYE and SIP but other than to satisfy dividend equivalent payments is restricted to 10% of the Companys issued shares calculated at the relevant time.
For the purposes of these limits, no account will be taken of options or awards granted before, on or in connection with Admission and no account will be taken of options or awards which have lapsed, been surrendered or otherwise become incapable of exercise or vesting.
Shares held in treasury will be treated as newly issued shares for the purposes of these limits as long as this is required by institutional investor guidelines, but for the avoidance of doubt shares acquired in the market will not.
e Individual limits The aggregate market value of shares comprised in awards granted to a colleague under the PSP and the CSOP in any financial year shall not exceed 150% of their annual salary for that year.
For the purposes of awards granted on or before Admission, market value for these purposes will be calculated by reference to the Offer Price.

SAYE On 25 February 2014, the Company adopted the SAYE which was registered with and self-certified with HMRC on 4 April 2015.
The rules of the SAYE were adopted pursuant to Schedule 3 of the Income Tax Earnings and Pensions Act 2003 and provide for the grant of tax approved options.
In September each year, the Company issues invitations under the rules of the SAYE which provides eligible colleagues with an opportunity to receive share options at a 20% discount to the market price.
The maximum monthly savings is 500 per month.
The Executive Directors have elected to participate in the Sharesave, along with 21% of eligible colleagues.
The options were granted in September 2014 and September 2015and in normal circumstances they are not exercisable until completion of a three year savings period, beginning on 1 December each year and will then be exercisable for a period of six months following completion of the relevant savings period.
a Eligibility All colleagues and full-time Directors of the Group, who have been in continuous service for such period of time not exceeding five years as may be determined by the Board prior to the relevant date of grant of an option and who are liable to UK income tax, are eligible to participate in the SAYE.
Participation may also be offered, at the discretion of the Board taking account of the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee, to other Directors or employees who otherwise do not satisfy all of the above criteria, although Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the SAYE.
b Issue of invitations Invitations to participate in the SAYE may be made during each 42 day period from and including i the date on which any amendment to the SAYE is approved or adopted by the Companys shareholders, ii the announcement of the Companys final or interim results for any financial period, iii the occurrence of an event which the Remuneration Committee considers to be an exceptional event concerning the Group or iv changes to the legislation affecting tax approved SAYE option schemes coming into effect.
If any of the above periods is a close period as a result of the application of the Model Code for Securities Transactions by Directors of Listed Companies or as a result of the Companys equivalent internal share dealing rules and the Company is prohibited from issuing invitations and or granting options as a result, then invitations may be made within 42 days of the end of the close period.
Invitations may be issued by the trustee of an employee benefit trust.
No invitations may be issued or options granted more than ten years after the adoption of the SAYE.
c Exercise price The price at which an option holder may acquire shares on the exercise of an option shall be determined by the Board but shall not be less than the greater of 80% of the market value of a share at the time of grant and its nominal value.
d Savings contract Options may be granted by the Board or the trustee of an employee benefit trust.
Upon applying for an option, the colleague will be required to enter into an approved savings contract with a savings institution nominated by the Company which lasts for either three or five years.
The maximum amount which an employee is permitted to contribute under SAYE contracts is 500 per month.
The Board may set lower savings limits than this for different colleagues by reference to objective criteria such as levels of salary or length of service.
The minimum contribution is 5 per month or such greater amount as the Board may specify, not to exceed 10.
The total exercise price of the shares over which the option is granted may not exceed the aggregate of the monthly contributions and bonus payable at the end of the colleagues related SAYE contract.
e Scheme limits The number of newly issued shares over which or in respect of which options may be granted under the SAYE on any date of grant shall be limited so that the total number of shares issued or capable of being issued in any ten year period under all the Companys employee share schemes including the CIP, CSOP, PSP and SIP but other than to satisfy dividend equivalent payments is restricted to 10% of the Companys issued shares calculated at the relevant time.
Any options or rights to acquire shares granted before, on or in connection with Admission will be excluded from this limit, and no account will be taken of options or awards which have lapsed, been surrendered or otherwise become incapable of exercise or vesting.
f Exercisability Options will normally be exercisable during a period of six months following the allocation of a bonus under the related SAYE contract and will normally lapse upon cessation of employment.
Earlier exercise is, however, permitted if the colleague dies or leaves employment through injury, disability, redundancy or retirement or where a colleague leaves employment of the Group by reason of his employing company ceasing to be a member of the Group, or if the undertaking in which he is employed is sold outside the Group.
Early exercise will also be permitted in the event of a takeover, reconstructions or voluntary winding up of the Company.
Pets at Home Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 157 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued 23.
Share based payments continued Fair value of share awards The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies over a relevant period prior to award.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise, which has been taken as three years.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds with a life equal to this expected life.
Options are valued using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model for the non-market based EPS element performance conditions and a Monte-Carlo simulation for the market-based TSR element performance conditions.
Special provisions allow early exercise in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the Company which employs the option holder ceases to be part of the Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding up of the Company.
