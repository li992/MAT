Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 236 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2016 H: Non-financial assets and liabilities H1: Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business and represents the premium of the amount paid over the fair value of identifiable asset and liabilities.
Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment reviews.
Other intangible assets include those assets which were initially recognised on a business combination and software development costs relate to amounts recognised for in-house systems development.
a Goodwill and goodwill impairment Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking is recognised as an asset at the date that control is achieved the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously-held equity interest if any, this excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment at least once annually.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On loss of control of a subsidiary undertaking, any attributable goodwill is included in the determination of any profit or loss on disposal.
On disposal of a business, where goodwill on acquisition is allocated to the entire cash-generating unit CGU, goodwill is allocated to the disposal on a relative basis.
Goodwill is allocated to one or more CGUs, being the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.
b Present value of acquired in-force for insurance and investment contract business The present value of acquired in-force for insurance and investment contract business is capitalised in the consolidated statement of financial position as an intangible asset.
The capitalised value is the present value of cash flows anticipated in the future from the relevant book of insurance and investment contract policies acquired at the date of the acquisition.
This is calculated by performing a cash flow projection of the associated life assurance fund and book of in-force policies in order to estimate future after tax profits attributable to shareholders.
The valuation is based on actuarial principles taking into account future premium income, mortality, disease and surrender probabilities, together with future costs and investment returns on the assets supporting the fund.
These profits are discounted at a rate of return allowing for the risk of uncertainty of the future cash flows.
The key assumptions impacting the valuation are discount rate, future investment returns and the rate at which policies discontinue.
The asset is amortised over the expected profit recognition period on a systematic basis over the anticipated lives of the related contracts.
The amortisation charge is stated net of any unwind in the discount rate used to calculate the asset.
The recoverable amount of the asset is re-calculated at each reporting date and any impairment losses recognised accordingly.
c Other intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination Contractual banking and asset management customer relationships, relationships with distribution channels and similar intangible assets, acquired as a part of a business combination, are capitalised at their fair value, represented by the estimated net present value of the future cash flows from the relevant relationships acquired at the date of acquisition.
Brands and similar items acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at their fair value based on a relief from royalty valuation methodology.
Subsequent to initial recognition such acquired intangible assets, if not categorised as infinite life, are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as set out below: Distribution channels 10 years Customer relationships 10 years Brand 15 20 years The estimated useful life is re-evaluated on a regular basis.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 237 Other intangible assets acquired in a business combination would be immediately impaired if the carrying value is greater than the net recoverable amount.
d Internally developed software Internally developed software software is amortised over its estimated useful life, where applicable.
Such assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Software is recognised in the statement of financial position if, and only if, it is probable that the relevant future economic benefits attributable to the software will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably.
Costs incurred in the research phase are expensed whereas costs incurred in the development phase are capitalised subject to meeting specific criteria, set out in the relevant accounting guidance.
The main criteria being that future economic benefits can be identified as a result of the development expenditure.
Amortisation is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the relevant software, which range between two and ten years, depending on the nature and use of the software.
e Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements Goodwill and intangible assets h Annual impairment testing of goodwill In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is tested annually for impairment for each CGU, by comparing the carrying amount of each CGU to its recoverable amount, being the higher of that CGUs value in use or fair value less costs to sell.
An impairment charge is recognised when the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value.
The cash flows attributable to the value of new business are determined with reference to latest approved three-year business plans.
The three-year business plan takes into account the management strategy for the underlying businesses, the capital available for deployment, the underlying macro-economic factors which impact the business and the region in which it operates as well as socio-economic factors.
Projections beyond the plan period are extrapolated using an inflation based growth assumption.
The value-in-use calculations for life assurance operations are determined as the sum of net tangible assets, the expected future profits arising from the in-force business after allowing for the cost of capital needed to support the business and the expected profits from future new business.
In determining the expected future profits, the same set of best estimate assumptions for persistency, expense, mortality and morbidity are used as per the Solvency II calculation.
The market share and market growth information are also used to inform the expected volumes of future new business.
The cash flows that have been used to determine the value in use of the cash generating units are based on the three year business plans.
These cash flows grow at different rates because of the different strategies of the cash generating units.
In cases where the cash generating units have made significant acquisitions in the recent past, the profits are forecasted to grow faster than the more mature businesses.
Post the five year growth forecast, the growth rate used to determine the terminal value of the cash generating units approximated the long-term growth rate of the countries.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 239 Emerging Markets Emerging Markets CGUs generate revenues through their life assurance, asset management, property & casualty and banking businesses in several regions, but principally Africa and Latin America.
Emerging Markets carries goodwill in three distinct CGUs: Old Mutual South Africa OMSA, Latin America LatAm and Old Mutual Southern and Eastern Africa OMSEA.
The basis of performing the impairment tests remained consistent in the current year and is consistent with the strategy for Emerging Markets, which is based on regional focus on the performance of the underlying businesses as a group.
Goodwill attributable to the business units, net of impairment losses were: m At At 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 OMSA 164 132 OMSEA 114 154 LatAm 70 58 348 344 Except for the impairment of goodwill in OMSEA CGU, the Directors are satisfied that any reasonable change in the assumptions would not cause the recoverable amounts of the goodwill to fall below the carrying amounts.
The main assumptions used in the impairment test were: Cash flows Initial cash flows were determined in accordance with the three-year business plan, adjusted for economic uncertainties in the areas in which the businesses operate.
Subsequent cash flows growth rates were as follows: for years four and five respectively: OMSA: 7.
0% for years four to seven : LatAm: 1 7.
0% 2015: 18.0% for years four to seven : and OMSEA: 18.0% 2015: 18.0% for years four to seven after year five terminal growth rates : OMSA: 2.4% 2015: 2.0% from year eight : LatAm: 1.
7% from year eight : and OMSEA: 4.5% 2015: 6.0% from year eight.
Discount rate The rate applied for each of the CGUs used was the relevant 10-year government bond rate adjusted for an equity market risk premium and other relevant risk adjustments, which were determined using market valuation models and other observable references.
The Group has recognised an impairment of 64 million in profit and loss relating to OMSEA CGU based on the value in use method to determine the recoverable amount.
The value in use of the OMSEA CGU was calculated based on the latest business planning numbers using a discount rate that included a 5% premium for the uncertainties that exist in the region.
The impairment is the result of the current difficult economic conditions in the Southern and East African region.
Our strategic review confirms that we will prioritise our high-return and cash generative businesses in sub-Saharan Africa and seek to improve returns from our recent investments in East and West Africa.
The following shows what the impairment to goodwill for the OMSEA CGU would have been if the following changes were made to the assumptions used with the other assumptions remaining unchanged : increase the discount rate by 1%: 122 million decrease the discount rate by 1%: 1 1 million decrease the growth rates in years four and five by 1%: 80 million Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financials 240 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2016 H: Non-financial assets and liabilities continued H1: Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements Goodwill and intangible assets continued Old Mutual Wealth The Old Mutual Wealth CGU generates revenues through its integrated business of life assurance and asset management.
Old Mutual Wealth is regarded by the Directors as a single cash generating unit due to the integrated nature of its operations.
On disposals of a business, goodwill is allocated to it based on the relative value of the business.
The basis of performing the impairment tests remained consistent in the current year.
The Directors are satisfied that any reasonable change in the assumptions would not cause the recoverable amounts of Old Mutual Wealth to fall below its carrying amount.
Growth rate the rate used was 14.0% 2015: 5.0% for the three-year business plan period and the expected inflation rate for the period beyond this.
Discount rate the rate applied was 8.7% 2015: 9.0% and used the relevant 10-year government bond rate as a starting point, which was adjusted for an equity market risk premium and other relevant risk adjustments, which were determined using market valuation models and other observable references.
Nedbank The impairment test in respect of Nedbank has been performed by comparing the CGUs net carrying amount to its estimated value in use.
The value-in-use has been determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are the discount rate and growth rate, which are based on the three-year business plan plus the terminal value.
Growth rates between 1.2%, for international business and 6.6%, for South African business 2015: 0.0% to 4.8% were applied to extrapolate cash flows for the period beyond the three-year business plan period.
The discount rate applied varied between 9.2% and 29.8% 2015: 9.8% to 15.4%.
The Directors are satisfied that a reasonable change in assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill to fall below the carrying amount.

For Emerging Markets, land and buildings are valued as at 31 December each year by internal professional valuers and external valuations are obtained once every three years.
For Nedbank, valuations are performed every three years by external professional valuers.
For each business, the valuation methodology adopted is dependent upon the nature of the property.
Income generating assets are valued using discounted cash flows and vacant land and property are valued according to sales of comparable properties.
The carrying value that would have been recognised had the land and buildings been carried under the historic cost model would be 33 million 2015: 22 million and 189 million 2015: 146 million respectively for Emerging Markets, 16 million 2015: 12 million and 1 16 million 2015: 89 million for Nedbank.
