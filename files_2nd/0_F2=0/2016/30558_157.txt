Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Financial statements 88 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 31 January 2016 8 Pensions 8.1 Accounting policies A defined contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and provides no guarantee as to the quantum of retirement benefits that those contributions will ultimately purchase.
A defined benefit scheme is a pension scheme that is not a defined contribution scheme.
Defined benefit schemes Pension scheme assets are valued at market rates.
Pension scheme obligations are an estimate of the amount required to pay the benefits that employees have earned in exchange for current and past service, assessed and discounted to present value using the assumptions shown in note 8.4.
The net pension asset recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet is the net of the schemes assets and obligations, which are calculated separately for each scheme.
Current service cost is treated as an operating cost in the Consolidated statement of income and Statement of cash flows and is part of underlying earnings.
Net interest income expense is calculated by applying the discount rate on liabilities to the net pension liability or asset adjusted for cash flows over the accounting period and is recognised in finance income costs and excluded from underlying earnings.
Expenses incurred in respect of the management of scheme assets are included in Other comprehensive income as a reduction in the return on scheme assets.
Other scheme expenses are recognised in profit or loss as an operating expense.
Remeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses on the obligations and the return on scheme assets excluding interest.
They are recognised immediately in Other comprehensive income.
Amounts shown within note 8 are before any adjustments for deferred taxation.
8.2 Defined benefit schemes: summary and description The Group operates a number of defined benefit retirement schemes together the Schemes providing benefits based on a benefit formula that depends on factors including the employees age and number of years of service.
The Morrison and Safeway Schemes provide pension benefits based on either the employees compensation package or career average revalued earnings CARE the CARE Schemes.
The CARE Schemes are not open to new members and were closed to future accrual in July 2015.
The RSP is a cash balance scheme, which provides a lump sum benefit based upon a defined proportion of an employees annual earnings, which is revalued each year in line with inflation.
The position of each scheme at 31 January 2016 is as follows: 2016 2015 m m CARE Schemes 178 43 RSP 8 4 Net pension asset liability 186 39 At the year end, schemes in surplus have been disclosed within assets on the balance sheet.
The Group has taken legal advice with regard to the recognition of a pension surplus and also recognition of a minimum funding requirement under IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirement and their interaction.
This advice concluded that recognition of a surplus is appropriate on the basis that the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of a surplus.
Amendments to the current version of IFRIC 14 are currently being considered.
The legal advice received by the Group has concluded that the above accounting treatment should not be affected by the current exposure draft of the revised wording to IFRIC 14.

The Board of each Scheme is required by law to act in the best interest of the Scheme participants and is responsible for setting the investment, funding and governance policies of the fund.
A representative of the Group attends Trustee Investment Committee meetings in order to provide the Groups view on investment strategy, but the ultimate power lies with the Trustees.
The Deed and Rules of the Morrison Scheme gives the Trustees the power to set contributions.
In the Safeway Schemes and the RSP this power is given to the Group, subject to regulatory override.
The latest full actuarial valuations have been carried out as at 1 April 2013 for the Safeway Schemes and 5 April 2013 for the Morrison Scheme and the RSP.
The results of these valuations for the CARE Schemes have been used and updated for IAS 19 Employee benefits purposes for the period to 31 January 2016 by a qualified independent actuary.
For the RSP, an actuarial valuation for the purposes of IAS 19, based on member data as at 31 January 2016, has been completed by an independent actuary.
The Schemes expose the Group to inflation risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
In addition, the CARE Schemes expose the Group to longevity risk.
8.3 Scheme assets Assets of the Schemes generate returns and ultimately cash that is used to satisfy the Schemes obligations.
They are not necessarily intended to be realised in the short term.
The Trustees of each Scheme invest in different categories of asset and in different allocations amongst those assets, according to the investment principles of that Scheme.
Currently, the investment strategy of the CARE Schemes is to maintain a balance of approximately 40% growth assets comprising equities and diversified growth funds and 60% bond-like-assets comprising liability driven investments, corporate bonds and multi asset credit investments.
RSP investments are currently based primarily in equities, however approximately 25% are in bond-like-assets.
There are no direct investments in the parent Companys own shares or property occupied by any member of the Group.

This is achieved through the use of liability driven investments LDI, whose main goal is to have sufficient assets to meet all current and future liabilities as they fall due.
LDI involves the use of derivatives such as swaps and other investment instruments.
There are no annuities or longevity swaps.
The movement in the fair value of the Schemes assets over the period was as follows: 2016 2016 2015 2015 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Fair value of scheme assets at start of period 4,050 87 3,058 39 Interest income 123 3 137 3 Return on scheme assets excluding interest 299 5 879 9 Employer contributions 27 49 46 39 Employee contributions 1 6 1 2 Benefits paid 87 1 68 4 Administrative expenses 3 1 3 1 Fair value of scheme assets at end of period 3,812 138 4,050 87 The Group previously entered into an agreement under which it contributed interests in a Scottish Limited Partnership SLP valued at 90m as at 30 January 2013 to the CARE Schemes.
During the year the Group agreed to provide an additional asset contribution of 150m.
The CARE Schemes interests in the SLP reduce the respective deficits on a funding basis, although the agreements do not affect the position directly on an IAS 19 accounting basis because the investments held by the CARE Schemes do not qualify as assets for IAS 19 purposes.
The additional 150m assets to be contributed to the SLP do not affect the funding or accounting position.
As partners in the SLP, the CARE Schemes are entitled to receive a share of the profits of the SLP twice a year for 20 years.
The profits shared with the Schemes are reflected in the Group financial statements as pension contributions.
The SLP made a cash contribution of 6.6m during the year ending 31 January 2016, and may make annual contributions of 6.6m for a further 17 years, dependent on funding levels in the schemes.
8.4 Present value of obligations The movement in the defined benefit obligation over the period was as follows: 2016 2016 2015 2015 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Defined benefit obligation at start of period 4,093 83 3,071 37 Current service cost 24 62 43 37 Interest expense 123 3 137 2 Actuarial loss demographic assumptions 21 Actuarial gain loss financial assumptions 517 18 889 16 Actuarial gain experience 5 7 Curtailment gain 3 1 Employee contributions 1 6 1 2 Benefits paid 87 1 68 4 Defined benefit obligation at end of period 3,634 130 4,093 83 The durations of the defined benefit obligations at the end of the 2016 reporting period are: RSP 20 years: Morrisons CARE 25 years: Safeway CARE 23 years.

Following analysis completed as part of the 2013 actuarial valuations a scaling factor of 110% was applied to the mortality tables used in the Morrison Scheme.
Amongst the UK population, there is a continuing trend for a generation to live longer than the preceding generation.
For the 2015 and 2016 year ends, and in line with the 2013 actuarial valuations the mortality projections used the CMI 2012 rates with an annual rate of improvement of 1.5% p. a.

2 Sensitivity analysis on significant actuarial assumptions The following table summarises the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period if each of the significant actuarial assumptions listed above were changed, in isolation, assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
In practice, any movement in assumptions could be accompanied by a partially offsetting change in asset values, and the corresponding overall impact on the net asset is therefore likely to be lower than the amounts below in a number of scenarios.
Extrapolation of the sensitivities shown may not be appropriate.
