International Public Partnerships Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 1.
BASIS OF PREPARATION International Public Partnerships Limited is a closed ended authorised investment company incorporated in Guernsey under the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
The address of the registered office is given on page 91.
The nature of the Groups Parent and consolidated subsidiary entities operations and its principal activities are set out on pages 3 and 9 respectively.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling as this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates and represents the functional currency of the Parent and all values are rounded to the nearest 000, except where otherwise indicated.
BASIS OF PREPARATION These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, adopted by the European Union, interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, applicable legal and regulatory requirements of Guernsey, and the Listing Rules of the U. K. Listing Authority.
These financial statements follow the historical cost basis, except for financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss and derivatives that have been measured at fair value.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out in relevant notes to the financial statements.
The Directors have determined that International Public Partnerships Limited is an investment entity as defined by IFRS 10 on the basis that the Company: a obtains funds from one or more investor s for the purpose of providing those investor s with investment management services: b commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income, or both: and c measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.
Accordingly, these financial statements consolidate only those subsidiaries that provide services relevant to its investment activities, such as management services, strategic advice and financial support to its investees, and that are not themselves investment entities.
Subsidiaries that do not provide investment-related services are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
GOING CONCERN As set out in the Directors Report, the Directors have reviewed cash flow forecasts prepared by management.
Based on those forecasts and an assessment of the Group's committed banking facilities, it has been considered appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Group on a going concern basis.
In arriving at their conclusion that the Group has adequate financial resources, the Directors were mindful that the Group had unrestricted cash of 29.3 million as at 31 December 2016.
In November 2016, the Companys corporate debt facility was increased to 400 million 2015: 300 million of which 292.6 million was uncommitted as at 31 December 2016, and is available for investment in new and existing projects until November 2019.
In addition, a portion of the facility can be utilised for working capital purposes.
The new facility is forecast to continue in full compliance with the associated banking covenants.
The Company also continues to fully cover operating costs and distributions from underlying cash flows from investments.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES The annual financial statements of International Public Partnerships Limited are prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The same accounting policies, presentation and methods of computation are followed in this set of financial statements as applied in the previous financial year.
The new and revised IFRS and interpretations becoming effective in the period have had no impact on the accounting policies of the Group.
Note 20 sets out a comprehensive listing of all new standards applicable from 1 January 2016.

SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES SERVICE ENTITIES AND CONSOLIDATION GROUP Following the adoption of IFRS 10 Investment Entity Amendments, the consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and service entities controlled by the Company up to 31 December 2016, that themselves do not meet the definition of an investment entity.
Typically a service entity provides management services, strategic advice and financial support to investee entities.
Judgement is therefore required in assessing which entities meet these definitional requirements.
The Directors have reviewed and assessed the criteria applied in the assessment of services entities based on the guidance in place as at 31 December 2016 and are satisfied with the resulting conclusion.
FAIR VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS Fair values are determined using the income approach which discounts the expected cash flows at a rate appropriate to the risk profile of each investment.
In determining the discount rate, relevant long-term government bond yields, specific investment risks and evidence of recent transactions are considered.
Details of the valuation process and key sensitivities are provided in note 11.
SEGMENTAL REPORTING Based on a review of information provided to the chief operating decision makers of INPP, the Group has identified four reportable segments based on the geographical risk associated with the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The factors used to identify the Groups reportable segments are centered on the risk free rates and the maturity of the Infrastructure sector within each region.
Further, foreign exchange and political risk is identified, as these also determine where resources are allocated.
Management has concluded that the Group is currently organised into four operating segments being U. K. Europe excl.
U. K., North America and Australia.
YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 U. K. EUROPE EXCL.
K. sectors were primarily the result of adverse foreign exchange movements in the year impacting valuation assumptions Revenue from investments which individually represent more than 10% of the Groups interest and dividend income approximates 12.2 million 2015: 12.0 million.

INVESTMENT INCOME ACCOUNTING POLICY Interest income Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of income can be measured reliably.
Interest income is accrued on a time-apportioned basis, using the effective interest rate of the instrument concerned as calculated at the acquisition or investment date.
Interest income is recognised gross of withholding tax, if any.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments and receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but excludes future credit losses.
Dividend income Dividend income is recognised gross of withholding tax in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on the date the right to receive payment is established.
This is the date when the Directors of the underlying project entity approve the payment of a dividend.
Net change in investments at fair value through profit or loss Net change in investments at fair value through profit or loss includes all realised and unrealised fair value changes including foreign exchange movements other than interest and dividend income recognised separately.

FINANCE COSTS ACCOUNTING POLICY Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially recorded as the proceeds received net of any directly attributable issue costs.
Subsequent measurement is at amortised cost, with borrowing costs recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they are incurred, using the effective interest rate method.
Arrangement fees are amortised over the term of the corporate debt facility.
Finance costs for the year were 3.8 million 2015: 4.5 million.
In November 2016, the Group increased its corporate debt facility from 300 million to 400 million.
As part of this increase to the existing facility, the banking group was expanded in the year to include Barclays Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation SMBC, ranking alongside the existing banking group of Royal Bank of Scotland and National Australia Bank.
The drawdowns in the period were in the form of cash drawdowns and issuance of letters of credit.
Cash drawdowns were used to partially fund investments and the letter of credit drawdowns were used to back the Groups commitment to specific future cash investments.
Following a tap issue equity capital raise in December 2016, the outstanding cash drawn balance on the facility was fully repaid.
As at 31 December 2016 the facility was notionally drawn via letters of credit supporting the Groups committed investments.
The uncommitted balance of the facility as at 31 December 2016 was 292.6 million.
The interest rate margin on the corporate debt facility is 175 basis points over Libor.
The loan facility matures in November 2019 and is secured over the assets of the Group.
72 International Public Partnerships Annual Report and financial statements 2016 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 9.
TAX ACCOUNTING POLICY Current tax is based on taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in past or future years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups asset liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The current tax charge credit in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income is recognised net of receivables recognised for losses surrendered to unconsolidated subsidiary entities.
Under the current system of taxation in Guernsey, the Company itself is exempt from paying taxes on income, profits or capital gains.
Dividend income and interest income received by the Group may be subject to withholding tax imposed in the country of origin of such income.

As a consequence of the adoption of IFRS 10 investment entity consolidation exception, underlying investee entity tax is not consolidated within these financial statements.
Total forecasted corporation tax payable by the Groups underlying investments is in excess of 824 million over their full concession lives.
EARNINGS PER SHARE The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: YEAR ENDED YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 31 DECEMBER 2015 000S 000S Earnings for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings per share being net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent 177,158 81,859 Number Number Weighted average number of Ordinary shares for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings per share 1,031,394,086 857,859,876 Basic and diluted pence 17.18 9.54 The denominator for the purposes of calculating both basic and diluted earnings per share is the same as the Group has not issued any share options or other instruments that would cause dilution.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the instrument expire or the asset is transferred and the transfer qualifies for derecognition in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expired.
Specific financial asset and liability accounting policies are provided below.
11.1 FINANCIAL ASSETS 31 DECEMBER 2016 31 DECEMBER 2015 000S 000S 1 Investments at fair value through profit and loss 1,515,163 1,201,107 Financial asset loans and receivables Trade and other receivables 32,506 23,099 Cash and cash equivalents 70,981 72,391 Derivative financial instruments Foreign exchange contracts - 1,719 Total financial assets 1,618,650 1,298,316 1 Includes fair value of investments in associates amounting to 2.3 million 2015: 2.0 million.
Movements in the period represent additional fair value gains offset by net repayments from investments.
ACCOUNTING POLICY The Group classifies its financial assets as at fair value through profit or loss or as loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired, with investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries other than those providing investment-related services being designated at fair value through profit and loss as required by IFRS 10.
Investments at fair value through profit or loss Investments in underlying unconsolidated subsidiaries and other non-controlled investments are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The Groups policy is to fair value both the equity and debt investments in underlying assets together.
All transaction costs relating to the acquisition of new investments are recognised directly in profit or loss.
Subsequent to initial recognition, equity and debt investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised within total investment income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Financial assets loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that are non-derivative financial assets, that have fixed or determinable payments, and are not quoted in an active market, are classified as loans and other receivables.
Loans and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instruments, but does not consider future credit losses.
Financial assets with maturities less than 12 months are included in current assets, financial assets with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date are classified as non-current assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivatives are recognised initially, and are subsequently remeasured, at fair value.
Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
Derivative assets and liabilities arising from different transactions are offset only if the transactions are with the same counterparty, a legal right of offset exists, and the parties intend to settle the cash flows on a net basis.
Fair value movements on derivative financial instruments held for trading are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
74 International Public Partnerships Annual Report and financial statements 2016 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 11.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED 11.1 FINANCIAL ASSETS CONTINUED Impairment of Financial Assets Financial assets, other than those classified at fair value through profit or loss are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been adversely impacted.
11.2 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 31 DECEMBER 2016 31 DECEMBER 2015 000S 000S Financial liabilities at amortised cost Trade and other payables 10,370 8,114 Derivative financial instruments Foreign exchange contracts 4,627 - Total financial liabilities 14,997 8,114 ACCOUNTING POLICY Trade and other payables Financial liabilities, other than those specifically accounted for under a separate policy, are stated based on the amounts which are considered to be payable in respect of goods or services received up to the financial reporting date.
The cost of other liabilities is considered to approximate their fair value.
11.3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups objective in managing risk is the protection of shareholder value.
Risk is inherent in the Groups activities and is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement and monitoring, subject to risk limits and other controls.
The process of risk management is critical to the Groups continuing profitability.
The Group is exposed to market risk which includes currency risk, interest rate risk and inflation risk, credit risk and liquidity risk arising from the financial instruments it holds.
The Groups Investment Adviser is responsible for identifying and controlling risks.
The Board of Directors supervises the Investment Adviser and is ultimately responsible for the overall risk management of the Group.
The Groups risk management framework and approach is set out within the Strategic Report pages 29 to 37.
The Board takes into account market, credit and liquidity risks in forming the Groups risk management strategy.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market variables such as changes in inflation, foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Inflation risk The majority of the Groups cash flows from underlying investments are linked to inflation indices.
Changes in inflation rates can have a positive or negative impact on the Groups cash flows from investments.
The long-term inflation assumptions applied in the Groups valuation of investments at fair value through profit or loss are disclosed in the fair value hierarchy section 11.4.
The Groups portfolio of investments has been developed in anticipation of continued inflation at or above the levels used in the Groups valuation assumptions.
Where inflation is at levels below the assumed levels for a sustained period of time, investment performance may be impaired.
The level of inflation linkage across the investments held by the Group varies and is not consistent.
75 International Public Partnerships Annual Report and financial statements 2016 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 11.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED 11.3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows from underlying investments therefore impacting the value of investments at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group has limited exposure to interest rate risk as the underlying borrowings within the unconsolidated investee entities are either hedged through interest rate swap arrangements or are fixed rate loans.
It is generally a requirement under a PFI PPP concession that any borrowings are matched to the life of the concession.
Hedging activities are aligned with the period of the loan, which also mirrors the concession period and are highly effective.
For certain regulated assets, the risk of adverse movements in interest rates is limited through protections provided by the regulatory regime.
The Groups corporate debt facility is unhedged on the basis it is utilised as an investment bridging facility and therefore drawn for a relatively short period of time.
Therefore, the Group is not significantly exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates over its variable rate borrowings.
Interest income on bank deposits held within underlying investments is included within the fair value of investments.
Foreign currency risk The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies and therefore is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
Currency risk arises in financial instruments that are denominated in a foreign currency other than the functional currency in which they are measured.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of short-term volatility in foreign exchange on significant investment returns from overseas investments.
The Group doesnt hedge its exposure to foreign exchange in relation to foreign currency denominated investment balances.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary financial instruments at the reporting date are set out in the table below: 31 DECEMBER 2016 31 DECEMBER 2015 000S 000S Cash Euro 791 871 Canadian Dollar 1,438 1,107 Australian Dollar 6 11 U. S. Dollar 3 3 2,238 1,992 Current receivables Euro receivables 414 393 U. S. Dollar receivables 1,382 - 1,796 393 Investments at fair value through profit or loss Euro 247,388 202,968 Canadian Dollar 39,135 34,819 Australian Dollar 97,657 85,370 U. S. Dollar 61,586 32,204 445,766 355,361 Total 449,800 357,746 Sensitivity analysis showing the impact of variations of the above risks on the fair value of investments is shown in section 11.5. Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of dealing with creditworthy counterparties and reviewing this on a regular basis at the underlying entity level.
The majority of underlying investments are in PFI PPP and similar concessions which are entered into with government, quasi government, other public or equivalent low risk bodies.
The maximum exposure of credit risk over financial assets as a result of counterparty default is the carrying value of those financial assets in the balance sheet.
76 International Public Partnerships Annual Report and financial statements 2016 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 11.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED 11.3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group would encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
The Group invests in relatively illiquid investments mainly non-listed equity and loans.
As a closed-ended investment vehicle there are no automatic capital redemption rights.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.
Cash flow forecasts assume full availability of underlying infrastructure to the public sector entities.
Failure to maintain assets available for use or operating in accordance with pre-determined performance standards may entitle the public sector to stop wholly or partially paying which may impact the investment income that the Group has projected to receive.
The Directors review the underlying performance of each investment on a quarterly basis, allowing asset performance to be monitored.
Contractual mechanisms also allow for significant pass-down of unavailability and performance risk to sub-contractors.
11.4 FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY All financial instruments for which fair value is recognised or disclosed are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 Quoted market prices in an active market that are unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable During the period there were no transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 categories.
Level 1: The Group has no financial instruments classified as level 1.
Level 2: This category includes derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, RPI Swaps and currency forward contracts.
As at 31 December 2016, the Groups only derivative financial instruments were currency forward contracts amounting to a liability of 4.6 million 2015: asset of 1.7 million.
Financial instruments classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable in an active market spot exchange rates, yield curves, interest rate curves.
Valuations based on observable inputs include financial instruments such as swaps and forward contracts which are valued using market standard pricing techniques where all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are observable.
Level 3: This category consists of investments in equity and loan instruments in underlying unconsolidated subsidiary entities and other noncontrolled investments which are classified at fair value through profit or loss.
At 31 December 2016, the fair value of financial instruments classified within Level 3 totalled 1,515.2 million 2015: 1,201.1 million.
Financial instruments are classified within Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price.
Valuation process Valuations are the responsibility of the Board of Directors.
The valuation of unlisted equity and debt investments is performed on a 1 quarterly basis by the Investment Adviser and reviewed by the senior members of the Investment Adviser.
The Investment Adviser verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to relevant project financial models and market information.
In addition, the accuracy of the computation is tested.
1 Indicative valuations performed at 31 March and 30 September.
77 International Public Partnerships Annual Report and financial statements 2016 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 11.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED 11.4 FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY CONTINUED Valuation process continued The latest valuation is also compared with the valuations in the preceding semi-annual and annual reporting periods.
The senior members of the Investment Adviser consider the appropriateness of the valuation methods and inputs.
On a quarterly basis, after the checks above have been performed, the Investment Adviser presents the valuation results to the Audit and Risk Committee.
This includes a discussion of the major assumptions used in the valuations, with an emphasis on the more significant investments.
Any changes in valuation methods and assumptions are discussed and agreed with the Groups Audit and Risk Committee for recommendation to the Board.
In addition, any new investment acquisitions by the Group from related parties are subject to an independent valuation provided to the Board.
Valuation methodology The valuation methodologies used are primarily based on discounting the underlying investee entities future projected net cash flows at appropriate discount rates.
Valuations are also reviewed against recent market transactions for similar assets in comparable markets observed by the Group or Investment Adviser and adjusted where appropriate.
Cash flow forecasts for each underlying investment are generated through detailed project specific financial models.
Financial models forecast the project related cash flows for the full term of the investment.
The cash flows included in the forecasts used to determine fair value are typically fixed under contracts however there are certain variable cash flows which are based on managements estimation.
These models also forecast the dividend, shareholder loan interest payments, capital repayments and senior debt repayments where applicable expected from the underlying investments.
Key macroeconomic inputs and assumptions utilised in projecting the Groups net future cash flows include: EUROPE U. K. EXCL.

NORTH AMERICA AUSTRALIA Inflation 2.75% 2.00% 2.00% 2.50% Long-term tax 20.00%-17.00% 12.50%-33.99% 26.50% -27.00% 30.00% Foreign exchange rates n a 1.12 1.30-1.71 1.86 Long-term deposit rates 2.00% 2.00% 2.00% 3.00% Discount rate The discount rate used for valuation of each investment is the aggregate of the following: - yield on government bonds with an average life equivalent to or as close as available to the weighted average concession length of the investments, issued by the national government for the location of the relevant investments government bond yield - a premium to reflect the inherent greater risk in investing in infrastructure assets over government bonds - a further premium to reflect the state of maturity of the asset with a larger premium applied to immature assets and or assets in construction and or to reflect any current asset specific or operational issues.
Typically this risk premium will reduce over the life of any asset as an asset matures, its operating performance becomes more established, and the risks associated with its future cash flows decrease.
However, the rate may increase in relation to investments with unknown residual values at the end of the relevant concession life as that date nears - a further adjustment reflective of market-based transaction valuation evidence for similar assets 78 International Public Partnerships Annual Report and financial statements 2016 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016 11.
