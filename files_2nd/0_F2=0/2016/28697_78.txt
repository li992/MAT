156 RELX Group Annual reports and financial statements 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 23 Borrowings Accounting policy Borrowings are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost, other than fixed rate borrowings in designated hedging relationships for which the carrying amount of the hedged portion of the borrowings is subsequently adjusted for the gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk.
When the related derivative in such a hedging relationship expires, is sold or terminated, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged borrowing is amortised in the income statement over the period to maturity of the borrowing using the effective interest method.
