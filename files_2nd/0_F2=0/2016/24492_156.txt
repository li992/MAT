The awards vested on the grant date and the options have the exercise price reduced by the value of any dividends declared up to the point of exercise.
These options were fully exercised on 12 February 2016 at a weighted average price of 1.263.
Note b: These equity-settled options were granted to certain Directors and employees.
The awards will vest in full and become exercisable on the share price being equal to or exceeding 6.00 per share for a continuous period of 90 calendar days at any time from the date of grant.
If there is a change of control, the awards will vest in full immediately unless the share price is less than 5.00 per share, in which case the Awards will lapse in full.
The awards have been treated as vesting over a three year period.
The Directors options under this scheme were cash cancelled during the year on the acquisition of bwin.
party, and the after-tax proceeds of 5.4m 10.3m gross re-invested in new GVC shares.
The remaining fair value of these options was transferred to equity and the additional cost has been recognised as an exceptional item in the year.
Note c: These equity-settled awards were issued on completion of the acquisition of bwin.
The options vest and become exercisable, subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition, over 30 months, with one-ninth vesting six months after the date of grant and a further ninth vesting at each subsequent quarter.
The options lapse, if not exercised, on 2 February 2026.
The performance condition is comparator total shareholder return TSR of the Group against the FTSE 250.
Each ninth of the shares will have its TSR condition reviewed from the date of grant until the relevant testing date.
To the extent the TSR is not met at that time, it is tested again the following quarter and, if necessary, at the end of the 30 month vesting period.
In order to vest, the TSR of the Group must rank at median or above against the FTSE 250.
In the year, two-ninths of the options had vested.
Having received the Directors notice to exercise, the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion to make a cash alternative payment to the Directors in respect of that portion of shares.
The cash alternative payment was calculated by deducting the option price from the market value of a share on the day prior to the date the Company received the exercise note.
Note d: These equity-settled awards were issued on the same basis as the awards in note c but at a higher exercise price which represents the market value of the shares as at the date the scheme became effective.
In order to compensate Lee Feldman for the higher exercise price, the Company has agreed to pay him a cash bonus of 2.0m over the 30 month vesting period of the option, but only upon option vesting and satisfaction of the performance condition described above, and he has to reinvest 50% of this in GVC shares.
Note e: These awards were issued on completion of the acquisition of bwin.
The equity-settled options, which are not subject to a performance condition, vest and become exercisable over 24 months, with one-seventh vesting six months after the date of grant and a further seventh vesting at each subsequent quarter.
Note f: These equity-settled awards were issued on the same basis as the awards in note c and granted on 16 December 2016.

10.3 Valuation of options The fair value of services received in return for share options granted were measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The Group engaged a third party valuation specialist to provide a fair value for the options.
The 2014 options were valued using a Monte Carlo model due to the performance conditions associated with the options.
The 2014 cash-settled options were revalued using a Monte Carlo model at 31 December 2015.
During the year, the 2014 cash-settled options and some of the 2014 equity-settled options were cashed out at an exercise price of 422p.
The excess of the cash settlement over the fair value of the options at the date of the settlement has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as a cost of share-based payments within exceptional items.
Fair value of share options and assumptions: Share price at Exercise Expected Risk free Fair value at 1 2 date of grant price volatility Exercise Expected rate measurement date Date of grant % multiple dividend yield % 2 February 2016 equity-settled 30 months 4.67 4.22 22%-30% n a n a n a 0.32-0.47 2 February 2016 equity-settled 30 months 4.67 4.67 22%-30% n a n a n a 0.22-0.28 2 February 2016 equity-settled 24 months 4.67 4.22 n a n a n a n a 0.32-0.47 16 December 2016 equity-settled 30 months 6.48 4.22 30%-28% n a n a n a 1.43-1.94 1.
This is the bid price, not the mid-market price, at market close, as sourced from Bloomberg.
The measurement of the risk-free rate was based on rate of UK sovereign debt prevalent at each grant date over the expected term of the option.
For the 2016 LTIP scheme, the expected volatilities have been calculated using historical prices for companies that were constituents of the FTSE 250 at the grant date.
These options accrue dividend credits and the yield is assumed to be nil for 2016 and 10% thereafter.
As the schemes vest on a staggered basis over a period of up to 30 months, the volatilities have been calculated over each relevant time period.
The fair value of each phase of the options has been calculated separately, shown as a range in the table above, and the cost of each phase is allocated across the vesting period for that phase.
