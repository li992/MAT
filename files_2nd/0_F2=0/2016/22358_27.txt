Investments In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Impairment The Group evaluates its investments for financial impairment where events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount ofsuch assets may not be fully recoverable.
When such evaluations indicate that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable value, an impairment in value is recorded.
Deferred Taxation Deferred tax is recognised using the Balance Sheet method, providing temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all temporary differences except as otherwise required by IAS 12.
Share-Based Payment Transactions The share options programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an addition to fixed asset investments with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of theoptions granted is measured using an evaluation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Shares appreciation rights are also granted by the Company to employees.
The fair value of the amount payable to the employee is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities.
The fair value is initially measured at grant date and spreadover the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The fair value of the share appreciation rights is measured based on an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which theinstruments were granted.
The liability is remeasured at each Balance Sheet date and at settlement date and any changes in fair value recognised in profit and loss spread equally over the vesting period.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises an increase in the cost ofinvestment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its subsidiarys financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
Amounts recharged to or reimbursed by the subsidiary are recognised as a reduction in the cost of investment in subsidiary.
