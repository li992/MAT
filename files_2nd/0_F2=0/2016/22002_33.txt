Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Bank borrowings Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis in the profit and loss account using the effective interest rate method.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Dividends Dividends receivable are recognised when the companys right to receive payment is established.
Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders equity in the period in which the shareholders right to receive payment is established.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Companys cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents on the basis there is right to offset.
Own shares held by ESOT Transactions of the Company-sponsored Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore reflected in the company financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases and sales of shares in the Company are debited and credited directly to equity.
N Brown Group plc 114 Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial statements 33 Prior period restatement N Brown plc operates Group wide equity settled share incentive schemes.
Whilst the Company has no own employees of its own, it settles all share incentive schemes granted to employees of its subsidiaries.
In 2016 the directors reviewed the application of IFRS 2 share based payments.
In prior periods, the Group wide schemes had not been reflected in the individual accounts of N Brown Group plc.
The Company accounts have been restated with the Company now recognising a credit to equity in respect of all group wide equity settled share based payment schemes.
As subsidiaries are not recharged for the share based payment charge, the amount is debited to cost of investment.
The impact on the balance sheet in 2015 and 2014 is shown below, described as Adjustment 1.
The Company also acts as sponsor transferring cash and selling sufficient shares to enable an employee benefit trust to meet obligations of the Group wide equity settled share incentive schemes.
In prior periods, the trust was accounted for in the Group accounts only and not in the Company accounts.
On the basis that the trust is merely acting as an agent of the Company, the Company accounts have been restated to account for the assets and liabilities of the trust as if they were assets and liabilities of the Company.
The Company cashflow statement has been restated on the same basis.
Under this treatment, the accounting in the Company accounts is the same as the accounting in the Group accounts.
The impact on the balance sheet in 2015 and 2014 is shown below, described as Adjustment 2.
