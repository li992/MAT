Exceptional items There are no exceptional items in FY16.
In the prior year, exceptional items amounted to a net income of 1.7m, of which 2.9m related to the reimbursement of certain costs by our insurers associated with historical UK matters and 1.7m related to the release of surplus provisions originally created in FY12 and FY14.
These were partially offset by the cost of a transaction the Group decided not to pursue.
