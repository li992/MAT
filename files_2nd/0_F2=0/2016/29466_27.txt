SSP GROUP Annual Report & Accounts 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 29.
Accounting policies SSP Group plc the Company is a company incorporated in the UK.
These financial statements present information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its Group.
Theseparate financial statements are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS101 under the historical cost accounting rules.
First time adoption of FRS101 In the year ended 30 September 2016 the Company changed its accounting framework from UK GAAP to FRS 101.
This change in the basis of preparation has not altered the recognition and measurement requirements previously applied in accordance with UK GAAP andas such the Company has not presented a restated balance sheet or a reconciliation of equity on transition to FRS 101.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions: the cash flow statement and related notes: disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries: disclosures in respect of capital management: the effects of new but not yet adopted IFRSs: and an additional balance sheet for the transition to FRS101.
Where relevant, equivalent disclosures have been given in the consolidated financial statements.
The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements except as noted below.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys balance sheet and related notes.
The Company uses Sterling as its presentational and functional currency and all values have been rounded to the nearest 0.1m unless otherwise stated.
Under section s408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
The loss for the financial year 2015: loss is disclosed in note 33 to these accounts.
The Company has no other recognised gains or losses in the current or preceding year and, therefore, no statement of comprehensive income is presented.
Going concern SSP Group plc is the ultimate parent company of the SSP Group.
The Company balance sheet has been prepared on a going concern basis, having regard to SSP Groups trading forecasts for the next 12 months.
See page 54 for consideration of the Groups going concern basis.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment losses.
Impairment The carrying values of the Companys assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
Animpairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
When a subsequent event orchange in circumstances causes the recoverable amount of an asset to increase, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except where it relates to items taken directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the treatment of items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by thebalance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 101.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Share-based payment compensation The Company has granted equity-settled share awards to Group employees.
Equity-settled awards are measured at fair value at grant date.
The fair value of awards granted to employees of the Company is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of the number of shares that will actually vest.
The cost of awards to employees of subsidiary undertakings isaccounted for as an additional investment in the employing subsidiary.
