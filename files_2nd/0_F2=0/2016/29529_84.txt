RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS Accounting policy The Group operates a number of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans around the world, including defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension plans on a mandatory, contractual basis, and such amounts are charged to operating expenses.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
For funded defined benefit plans, the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets.
For unfunded defined benefit plans the liability recognised at the balance sheet date is the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using an interest rate equal to the yield on high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have a term to maturity approximating to the term of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses that arise are recognised in shareholders equity and presented in the statement of other comprehensive income in the period they arise.
The Group determines the net interest expense on the net defined liability for the year by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then net defined benefit liability, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability during the year as a result of contributions and benefit payment.
Net interest expense and other expense related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the income statement.
Significant accounting estimates and judgements There are many factors that affect the measurement of retirement benefit obligations as it requires the use of assumptions which are inherently uncertain: the sensitivity of the liabilities to changes in these assumptions is shown in the note below.
Retirement benefit obligations comprise: 2016 2015 $million $million Defined benefit plans obligation 495 422 Defined contribution plans obligation 30 23 Net obligation 525 445 Retirement benefit charge comprises: 2016 2015 $million $million Defined benefit plans 85 96 Defined contribution plans 231 203 Charge against profit note 7 316 299 The Group operates 50 defined benefit plans across its geographies, many of which are closed to new entrants who now join defined contribution arrangements.
The aim of all these plans is to give employees the opportunity to save appropriately for retirement in a way that is consistent with local regulations, taxation requirements and market conditions.
The defined benefit plans expose the Group to currency risk, interest rate risk, investment risk and actuarial risks such as longevity risk.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued The material holdings of government and corporate bond holdings shown in the asset table below partially hedge movements in the liabilities resulting from interest rate changes.
Setting aside movements from other drivers such as currency fluctuation, the falls in discount rates in most geographies over 2016 have led to higher liabilities.
These have been somewhat offset by rises in the value of bonds held.
These movements are shown as actuarial losses versus gains respectively in the tables below.
The disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by independent qualified actuaries based on the most recent full actuarial valuations updated, where necessary, to 31 December 2016.
UK Fund The Standard Chartered Pension Fund the UK Fund is the Groups largest pension plan, representing 60 percent of total pension liabilities, and provides pensions based on 1 60th of final salary per year of service, normally payable from age 60.
The UK Fund is set up under a Trust that is legally separate from the Bank its formal sponsor and, as required by UK legislation, at least one third of the Trustee Directors are nominated by members: the remainder are appointed by the Bank.
The Trustee Directors have a fiduciary duty to members and are responsible for governing the UK Fund in accordance with its Trust Deed and Rules.
The financial position of the UK Fund is regularly assessed by an independent qualified actuary.
The most recent funding valuation was performed as at 31 December 2014 by A Zegleman, Fellow of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, of Willis Towers Watson, using the projected unit method and assumptions different from those below.
To repair the $89 million 72 million past service deficit identified as at 31 December 2014, four annual cash payments of $15.5 million 12.6 million were agreed, starting in January 2016.
The agreement allows that if the funding position improves more quickly than expected, the three payments from January 2017 could be reduced or eliminated.
The actuarial assessment that applied to the January 2017 payment did not allow for a reduction, so the full 12.6 million was paid into the Fund on 16 January 2017.
In addition, an escrow account of $136 million 110 million exists to provide security for future contributions.
Following the 31 December 2014 valuation, regular contributions to the UK Fund were set at 32 per cent of pensionable salary for all members.
The next valuation is due as at 31 December 2017.
With effect from 1 July 1998, the UK Fund was closed to new entrants and new employees are offered membership of a defined contribution plan.
Over 85 per cent of the Funds liabilities now relate to pensioners or ex-employees who have left the Group but have not yet retired.
As at 31 December 2016, the weighted-average duration of the UK Fund was 16 years 2015: 15 years.
The Bank is not required to recognise any additional liability under IFRIC 14 or the current exposure draft of proposed amendments to it, as it has control of any pension surplus.
Overseas plans The principal overseas defined benefit arrangements operated by the Group are in Germany, Hong Kong, India, Jersey, Korea, Taiwan and the United States US.
The assumptions for life expectancy for the UK Fund are that a male member currently aged 60 will live for 28 years 2015: 28 years and a female member 29 years 2015: 29 years and a male member currently aged 40 will live for 30 years 2015: 30 years and a female member 31 years 2015: 31 years after their 60th birthdays 2.
The range of assumptions shown is for the main funded defined benefit overseas plans in Germany, Hong Kong, India, Jersey, Korea, Taiwan and the US.
These comprise over 85 per cent of the total liabilities of funded overseas plans These assumptions are likely to change in the future and this will affect the value placed on the liabilities.
For example, changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the amounts shown below: If the discount rate increased by 25 basis points the liability would reduce by approximately $70 million for the UK Fund and $35 million for the other plans If the rate of inflation and pension increases by 25 basis points the liability would increase by approximately $45 million for the UK Fund and $10 million for the other plans If the rate salaries increase compared to inflation by 25 basis points the liability would increase by approximately $6 million for the UK Fund and $10 million for the other plans If longevity expectations increased by one year the liability would increase by approximately $35 million for the UK Fund and $10 million for the other plans Although this analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the UK Fund, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity to the main assumptions.
While changes in other assumptions would also have an impact, the effect would not be as significant.
