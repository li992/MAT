Adjusted EBIT EBITDA Adjusted EBIT EBITDA, as defined in note 2 of the financial statements, provide insight into our overall business performance a combination of cost management, seizing market opportunities and growth, and are the corresponding flow drivers towards our objective of achieving industry-leading returns.
Adjusted EBIT is the net result of revenue less cost of goods sold and selling and administrative expenses, plus share of income from associates and joint ventures, dividend income and the attributable share of underlying Adjusted EBIT of certain associates and joint ventures which are accounted for internally by means of proportionate consolidation, excluding significant items.
In addition, the segment information includes Glencore Agri, which has been disclosed as a discontinued operation until close of transaction on 1 December 2016, see note 23 of the financial statements.
Adjusted EBITDA consists of Adjusted EBIT plus depreciation and amortisation, including the related adjustment for Proportionate Consolidation.
In addition, the relationships Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net interest interest expense less interest income disclosed on the face of the consolidated statement of income loss are an indication of our financial flexibility and ability to service debt.
Adjustment for Proportionate Consolidation For internal reporting and analysis, management evaluates the performance of Antamina copper zinc mine 34% owned, Cerrejn coal mine 33% owned, Collahuasi copper mine 44% owned and Glencore Agri 50% owned under the proportionate consolidation method reflecting Glencores proportionate share of the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of these investments.
Current capital employed CCE Current capital employed is current assets less accounts payable, current deferred income, current provisions, current other financial liabilities and income tax payable.
Funds from operations FFO FFO is a measure that reflects our ability to generate cash for investment, debt servicing and distributions to shareholders.
It comprises cash provided by operating activities before working capital changes, less tax and net interest payments plus dividends received, related adjustments for Proportionate Consolidation and certain other one-off Significant items identified expenses, comprising unrealised coal related hedging costs and a legal settlement in 2016 and a legal settlement and net incremental metal leak costs incurred in 2015.
Net funding debt and FFO to net debt Net funding debt demonstrates how our debt is being managed and is an important factor in insuring we maintain an investment grade rating status and an attractive cost of capital.
In addition, the relationship of FFO to net debt is an indication of our financial flexibility and strength.
Net debt is defined as total current and non-current borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, readily marketable inventories and related adjustments for Proportionate Consolidation.
Net income attributable to equity shareholders pre-significant items Net income attributable to equity shareholders pre-significant items is a measure of our ability to generate shareholder returns.
For 2016, calculation of tax items to be excluded from Net income, includes tax significant items and the tax effect of non-tax significant items themselves.
Previously, the calculation was driven by estimated notional effective tax rates: refer to the reconciliation of tax expense below.
Glencore Annual Report 2016 201 Additional information Glossary Readily marketable inventories RMI RMI comprising the core inventories which underpin and facilitate Glencores marketing activities, represent inventories, that in Glencores assessment, are readily convertible into cash in the short term due to their liquid nature, widely available markets and the fact that price risk is covered either by a forward physical sale or hedge transaction.
Glencore regularly assesses the composition of these inventories and their applicability, relevance and availability to the marketing activities.
As at 31 December 2016, $17,093 million 2015: $15,356 million of inventories were considered readily marketable.
This comprises $12,707 million 2015: $10,928 million of inventories carried at fair value less costs of disposal and $4,386 million 2015: $4,428 million carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Total readily marketable inventories includes $1,718 million related to certain associates and joint ventures see note 2 accounted under the proportionate consolidation method, comprising $1,384 million of inventory carried at fair value less cost of disposal and $334 million carried at lower of cost or net realisable value.
Given the highly liquid nature of these inventories, which represent a significant share of current assets, the Group believes it is appropriate to consider them together with cash equivalents in analysing Group net debt levels and computing certain debt coverage ratios and credit trends.
Significant items Significant items of income and expense which, due to their financial impact and nature or the expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, are separated for internal reporting and analysis of Glencores results to provide a better understanding and comparative basis of the underlying financial performance.
