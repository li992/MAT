Level 2 not level 1 but are observable for that asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 not based on observable market data unobservable.
Of the other financial assets listed above, all are measured at fair value using level 2 inputs.
All other financial liabilities are measured at fair value using level 2 inputs.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, forward precious metal price contracts and currency swaps is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows using appropriate market sourced data at the balance sheet date.
28 Financial risk management The groups and parent companys activities expose them to a variety of financial risks including credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk.
Market risk includes currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk.
The main financial risks managed by the group and parent company, under policies approved by the board, are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The group and parent company use derivative financial instruments, in particular forward currency contracts and currency swaps, to manage their financial risks associated with their underlying business activities and the financing of those activities.
Some derivative financial instruments used to manage financial risk are not designated as hedges and so are classified as held for trading.
The group and parent company do not undertake any speculative trading activity in financial instruments.
28a Credit risk Within certain businesses, the group and parent company derive a significant proportion of their revenue from sales to major customers.
Sales to individual customers are frequently high if the value of precious metals is included in the price.
The failure of any such company to honour its debts could materially impact the groups and parent companys results.
The group and parent company derive significant benefit from trading with their large customers and manage the risk at many levels.
Each business and division has a credit committee that regularly monitors its exposure.
The Audit Committee receives a report every six months that details all significant credit limits, amounts due and amounts overdue within the group and the relevant actions being taken.
At 31st March 2016 trade receivables for the group amounted to 774.1 million 2015 restated 805.4 million parent company 147.2 million 2015 176.2 million.
561.7 million 2015 550.9 million of these receivables at group level 102.9 million 2015 107.7 million at parent company level arose in Emission Control Technologies ECT which mainly supplies the automotive industry including car and truck manufacturers and component suppliers.
Although ECT has a wide spread of the available customers, the concentrated nature of this industry means that amounts owed by individual customers can be large.
Other parts of the group tend to sell to a larger number of customers and amounts owed tend to be lower.
As at 31st March 2016 and at 31st March 2015 for the group as a whole, no single outstanding balance exceeded 2% of the groups revenue.
No assets have been taken possession of as collateral.
The credit profiles of the groups and parent companys customers are obtained from credit rating agencies and are closely monitored.
The scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and credit limits.
Generally, payments in the automotive industry and in the other markets in which the group operates are made promptly.
167 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2016 28 Financial risk management continued 28a Credit risk continued Trade receivables are considered impaired when the amount is in dispute, customers are in financial difficulty or for other reasons which imply there is doubt over the recoverability of the debt.
Trade receivables can be analysed as: Group Parent company 2016 2015 2016 2015 restated note 40 million million million million Amounts neither past due nor impaired 711.9 719.9 132.1 162.3 Amounts past due but not impaired less than 30 days 45.9 61.7 10.4 10.2 30 90 days 9.6 16.4 3.5 2.1 more than 90 days 7.4 7.7 1.2 1.6 Total past due but not impaired 62.9 85.8 15.1 13.9 Amounts impaired 6.6 4.6 1.2 1.0 Specific allowances for bad and doubtful debts 6.6 3.8 1.2 1.0 Carrying amount of impaired receivables 0.8 Other allowances for bad and doubtful debts 0.7 1.1 Trade receivables net of allowances 774.1 805.4 147.2 176.2 Movements in the allowances for impairments were: Group Parent company 2016 2015 2016 2015 million million million million At beginning of year 4.9 6.8 1.0 2.0 Charge for year 4.9 1.2 0.4 0.5 Released 1.2 1.6 0.2 0.5 Utilised 1.4 1.6 1.0 Exchange adjustments 0.1 0.1 At end of year 7.3 4.9 1.2 1.0 The groups financial assets included in sundry receivables are all current and not impaired.
As a result of the impairments note 5, the parent companys amounts receivable from subsidiaries have been impaired by 127.7 million.
The credit risk on cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties with significant balances are banks with high credit ratings.
The exposure to individual banks is monitored frequently against internally defined limits together with the banks credit ratings and credit default swap prices.
As at 31st March 2016, the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits was 45.9 million 2015 15.2 million for the group and 12.0 million 2015 7.7 million for the parent company, whilst the largest mark to market exposure for derivative financial instruments to a single bank was 7.9 million 2015 9.3 million for the group and parent company.
The group and parent company also use money market funds to invest surplus cash thereby further diversifying credit risk and at 31st March 2016 the groups and parent companys exposure to these funds was 210.8 million 2015 nil.
The amounts on deposit at the year end represent the groups and parent companys maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and deposits.
The parent company also guarantees some of its subsidiaries borrowings, partly through interest netting arrangements, payables and precious metal leases and its exposure at 31st March 2016 was 27.5 million 2015 33.8 million.

Accounts NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2016 28 Financial risk management continued 28b Foreign currency risk The group operates globally with a significant amount of its profit earned outside the UK.
In order to protect the groups sterling balance sheet and reduce cash flow risk, the group has financed most of its investment in the USA and Europe by borrowing US dollars and euros respectively.
Although much of this funding is obtained by directly borrowing the relevant currency, a part is achieved through currency swaps which can be more efficient and reduce costs.
To a lesser extent the group has also financed a portion of its investment in China using a currency swap.
The group has designated the currency swaps, a US dollar loan and a euro loan fair value of the loans was 58.7 million 2015 a US dollar loan and some euro loans with a fair value of 230.6 million as hedges of net investments in foreign operations as they hedge the changes in values of the subsidiaries' net assets against movements in exchange rates.
These are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The majority of the cash flows are expected to occur and the hedge effect realised in the income statement in the year ending 31st March 2017.
The main impact of movements in exchange rates on the groups results arises on translation of overseas subsidiaries profits into sterling.
The groups largest exposure is to the US dollar and a 5% 7.6 cent 2015 8.1 cent movement in the average exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling would have had a 9.8 million 2015 9.7 million impact on operating profit.
The group is also exposed to the euro and a 5% 6.8 cent 2015 6.4 cent movement in the average exchange rate for the euro against sterling would have had a 6.8 million 2015 5.1 million impact on operating profit.
This exposure is part of the groups economic risk of operating globally which is essential to remain competitive in the markets in which the group operates.
For financial instruments the main exposures are to the US dollar and euro and are due to loans, swaps and cash flow hedges on forecast receipts and payments.
A 5% 7.2 cent 2015 7.4 cent movement in the closing exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling would have had a 4.5 million 2015 3.1 million impact on operating profit and a 36.6 million 2015 36.6 million impact on equity for these instruments.
A 5% 6.3 cent 2015 6.9 cent movement in the closing exchange rate for the euro against sterling would have had a 6.0 million 2015 4.7 million impact on operating profit and a 36.9 million 2015 22.4 million impact on equity for these instruments.
However, the impact on operating profit relates primarily to the cash flow hedging instruments hedging the forecast receipts and payments whose cash flows have occurred in the year and so would be offset by similar movements in the hedged items.
Similarly, the impact on equity relates primarily to foreign exchange positions used to hedge the subsidiaries net assets and so would be offset by an equal and opposite movement in the value of the relevant subsidiaries net assets.
The remaining impact on equity of 2.1 million 2015 6.0 million for the US dollar and 6.8 million 2015 4.5 million for the euro relates to cash flow hedging instruments hedging the forecast receipts and payments whose cash flows have yet to occur.
169 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31st March 2016 28 Financial risk management continued 28c Interest rate risk The groups and parent companys interest rate risk arises from their fixed rate borrowings fair value risk and floating rate borrowings cash flow risk.
Their policy is to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings and equity.
They manage their risk by reviewing the profile of their debt regularly and by selectively using interest rate and cross currency swaps to maintain borrowings in appropriate currencies and at competitive rates.
The group and parent company have designated three 2015 three US dollar fixed rate to US dollar floating rate swaps as fair value hedges as they hedge the changes in fair value of bonds attributable to changes in interest rates.
The losses on the interest rate swaps in the year ended 31st March 2016 were 0.2 million 2015 0.8 million and the gains on the bonds attributable to the hedged risk were 0.6 million 2015 1.2 million.
The group and parent company have designated the US dollar fixed interest rate to sterling fixed interest rate cross currency swap as a cash flow hedge as it hedges the movement in the cash flows of the hedged bond attributable to changes in the US dollar sterling exchange rate.
Its cash flows are expected to occur in 2025 when the bond which it hedges matures and so the exchange effect on it is expected to be realised in the income statement in 2025.
The interest element is realised in the income statement each year.
At 31st March 2016, 96% 2015 62% of the groups net debt and 90% 2015 63% of the parent companys net debt were at fixed rates with an average interest rate of 2.99% 2015 3.23%.
The remaining debt is funded on a floating rate basis.
Based on the groups net debt funded at floating rates, after taking into account the effect of the swaps, a 1% change in all interest rates would have a 0.2 million 2015 3.8 million impact on the groups profit before tax.
This is within the range the board regards as acceptable.

There were no transfers of any financial instrument between the levels of the fair value hierarchy note 27 during the year.
28e Liquidity risk The groups and parent companys policy on funding capacity is to ensure that they always have sufficient long term funding and committed bank facilities in place to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements.
At 31st March 2016 the group and parent company had borrowings under committed bank facilities of nil 2015 192.0 million.
The group and parent company also have a number of uncommitted facilities, including metal leases, and overdraft lines at their disposal.
