The Group also owns logistics assets in Austria which operate a fleet of vessels operating on the Rhine and Danube waterways and an ocean going vessel which provides top off services and operates on international sea routes.
The Groups operations are vertically integrated from iron ore mining through to iron ore concentrate and pellet production and subsequent logistics.
The Groups mineral properties lie within the Kremenchug Magnetic Anomaly and are currently being extracted at the  and Lavrikovskoye GPL and Yeristovskoye deposits.
The majority shareholder of the Group is Fevamotinico S. a. r. l. Fevamotinico, a company incorporated in Luxembourg and ultimately owned by The Minco Trust, of which Kostyantin Zhevago, the Groups Chief Executive Officer, is a beneficiary.

Note 2: Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Ferrexpo plc and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for post-employment benefits and available-for-sale financial assets, the latter measured at fair value in accordance with the requirements of IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement, the former measured in accordance with IAS 19 revised Employee benefits.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of US Dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwiseindicated.
The detailed accounting policies are included in the disclosure notes to the specific financial statement accounts.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements for Ferrexpo plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 December each year.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared as at the same reporting date as Ferrexpo plcs, using consistent accounting policies.
Subsidiaries acquired are fully consolidated from the date the Group obtains effective control.
Similarly, subsidiaries disposed of are deconsolidated from the date on which the Group ceases to hold effective control.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without obtaining or losing control is accounted for as an equity transaction.
All intercompany balances and transactions including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions have been eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered.
Business combinations On the acquisition of a subsidiary, the business combination is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregated amount of the consideration transferred, measured at the date of acquisition.
The consideration paid is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition.
Acquisition costs are expensed when incurred and included in general and administrative expenses.
Functional and presentational currencies Based on the economic substance of the underlying business transactions and circumstances relevant to the parent, the functional currency of the parent has been determined to be the US Dollar, with each subsidiary determining its own functional currency based on its own circumstances.
The Group has chosen the US Dollar as its presentational currency.
The functional currency of Ukrainian subsidiaries, which is where the Groups main operations are based, is the Ukrainian Hryvnia.
Foreign currency translation For individual subsidiary company accounts, transactions in foreign currencies i. e. other than the functional currency are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date and non-monetary assets and liabilities at the historic rate.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
For presentation of the Groups consolidated accounts, if the functional currency of a subsidiary is different to the presentational currency as at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of this entity are translated into the presentational currency at the rate ruling at the reporting date and the income statement is translated using the average exchange rate for the period based on the officially published rates by the National Bank of Ukraine NBU.
The foreign exchange differences arising are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity the deferred cumulative amount of exchange differences recognised in equity relating to the particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
FERREXPO PLC 99 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 2: Basis of preparation continued During the financial year 2016, the Ukrainian Hryvnia has devalued by approximately 13% 2015: 52% compared to the US Dollar from 24.001 as at 31 December 2015 to 27.191 as at the end of this reporting period.
This has had a significant impact on the carrying values of property, plant and equipment Note 17, income taxes recoverable and prepaid Note 15 and other taxes recoverable and payable Note 23.
These effects are reflected in the translation reserve included in shareholders equity.
Note 3: New accounting policies New standards and interpretations adopted The accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Groups annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 except for the adoption of new amendments and improvements to IFRSs effective as of 1 January 2016.
These new standards and interpretations had no effect on reported results, financial position or disclosure in the financial statements: IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements disclosure initiative Amendments to IFRS 11: Joint arrangements: Accounting for acquisitions of interests Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle New standards and interpretations not yet adopted The Group has elected not to early adopt any revised and amended standards, which are not yet mandatory in the EU.
The standards below could have an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments The complete standard has been issued in July 2014 including the requirements previously issued and additional amendments.
The new standard replaces IAS 39 and includes a new expected loss impairment model, changes to the classification and measurement requirements of financial assets as well as to hedge accounting.
The new standard becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Group has begun the impact assessment on the new standard and expects that the classification and measurement of its financial instruments under the new standard will remain largely unchanged.
The Group does not intend to early adopt this standard.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers The new standard was issued in May 2014 and outlines a single comprehensive model of accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance.
The new standard also establishes the principles for the disclosure of relevant information in the financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainties of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The new standard becomes mandatory for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Group expects that there will be an impact in terms of the recognition of transport related revenue.
The Group has begun the impact assessment on this new standard and does not intend to early adopt this standard.
IFRS 16 Leases The new standard was issued in January 2016 replacing the previous leases standard, IAS 17 Leases, and related Interpretations.
IFRS 16 establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for the customer lessee and the supplier lessor.
IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating or finance as is required by IAS 17 and, instead, introduces a single lessee accounting model requiring a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the underlying asset has a low value or the lease term is 12 months or less.
This new standard applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 subject to EU endorsement.
The Group expects that the new standard will result in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in respect of some of the Groups contractual lease arrangements in place that are currently accounted for as operating lease.
The Company does not intend to early adopt this standard.
The Group does not expect an impact on its consolidated financial statements from all other standards, interpretations and amendments issued at the reporting date, but not yet to be adopted for these financial statements.
10 0 FERREXPO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Note 4: Use of estimates and critical judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
These estimates are based on information available as at the date of authorising the consolidated financial statements for issue.
Actual results, therefore, could differ from those estimates.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements made by management in preparing the consolidated financial information are described in the following notes: Estimates Defined benefit pension liability The valuation for defined benefit superannuation schemes requires management to make judgements as to the nature of benefits provided by each scheme and thereby determine the classification of each scheme.
For defined benefit schemes, management is required to make annual estimates and assumptions about future returns on classes of scheme assets, future remuneration changes, employee attrition rates, administration costs, changes in benefits, inflation rates, exchange rates, life expectancy and expected remaining periods of service of employees.
In making these estimates and assumptions, management considers advice provided by external advisers, such as actuaries.
At 31 December 2016, the carrying amount of defined benefit pension liability was US$15,489 thousand 2015: US$17,034 thousand.
Detailed disclosure is made in Note 25.
Impairment testing Assessing the Groups non-current operating assets for impairment requires a significant amount of judgement.
The determination of fair value and value-in-use requires management to make estimates and assumptions about expected production and sales volumes, commodity prices considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors, reserves, operating costs, closure and rehabilitation costs and future capital expenditure.
These estimates and assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty: hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter these projections, which may impact the recoverable amount of the assets.
In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying value of the assets may be impaired and the impairment would be charged against the income statement.
The total of property, plant and equipment amounted to US$580,398 thousand as of 31 December 2016 2015: US$654,392 thousand.
See also Note 17 for further information.
As outlined in Note 18 the impairment testing of goodwill is based on significant judgements and assumptions made by management when performing the annual impairment testing of these non-current assets.
Changes to be made to these assumptions may alter the results of the impairment testing, the impairment charges recorded in the income statement and the resulting carrying values of the non-current assets tested.
The carrying amount of the goodwill amounted to US$29,033 thousand as of 31 December 2016 2015: US$32,938 thousand.
Related disclosures are also made in Note 18.
Judgements Restricted cash and deposits On 17 September 2015, the NBU announced that it had adopted a decision to declare the Groups transactional bank in Ukraine insolvent and the bank was put into temporary administration by the Deposit Guarantee Fund.
The bank licence of Bank Finance & Credit Bank F&C was revoked by the NBU on 17 December 2015 and the liquidation was initiated by the Deposit Guarantee Fund.
The total balance of cash and deposits held at Bank F&C is no longer available to the Group and has therefore been reclassified from cash and cash equivalents to restricted cash and deposits.
It is expected that the liquidation of the bank will take several years and the level of potential recoverability of the remaining balance of restricted cash and deposits is still uncertain as at 31 December 2016.
A full allowance of the balance not available to the Group was recorded as at the end of the comparative period ended of 31 December 2015, except for an amount of US$9,308 thousand claimed by the Group in the court.
As a result of the outcome of the court proceedings during the financial year 2016, the Group decided to increase the allowance for the amount being still heard in the court, resulting in a charge of US$8,525 thousand at the average exchange rate for December 2016 recognised in the income statement.
See Note 35 for further information.
Capitalised stripping costs Overburden and other mine waste materials have to be removed prior to the production of the mine in order to gain access to the iron ore body.
These activities are referred to as pre-production stripping costs and are capitalised under assets under construction.
The preproduction stripping costs are capitalised based on calculations which require the use of judgement and estimates in terms of estimated tonnage of overburden and waste material to be removed during the lifetime of the mine and the expected recoverable reserves that can be extracted.
The change of the mine plan life and design in the future may result in changes to the expected stripping ratio waste to mineral reserves ratio and require adjustment of the capitalised pre-production stripping costs.
Production stripping costs are capitalised when the stripping activities in the production phase of a mine result in improved access to components of the ore body.
An important area of judgement is the distinction between the pre-production and production phase of a mine together with the identification of the components of the ore body and the allocation of the production stripping costs to the components of the ore body or the inventory produced.
At 31 December 2016, the carrying amount of capitalised pre-production stripping costs included in assets under construction amounted to US$70,663 thousand 2015: US$70,530 thousand.
No production stripping costs are capitalised as at 31 December 2016 2015: nil.
FERREXPO PLC 101 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 4: Use of estimates and critical judgements continued Lean and weathered ore Iron ore of various grades is currently being extracted at the Groups two operating mines GPL and Yeristovskoye.
The Group has one processing plant at FPM.
In order to maximise the operational efficiency and output of the processing facility, management determines the optimal mix and grade of ore to be delivered to the processing facility from each mine.
During the last four financial years, including the financial year 2016, the dominant grade of ore used for processing was of higher grade and ore of lower iron content or more difficult to process was stockpiled to be processed in subsequent periods.
As at 31 December 2016, the Group had stock of lean and weathered ore extracted by PJSC Ferrexpo Poltava Mining FPM and LLC Ferrexpo Yeristovo Mining GOK FYM totalling US$132,822 thousand 2015: US$98,802 thousand.
It is the Groups intention to process the stockpiled lean and weathered ore. Based on the Groups current processing plans it is, however, not expected that the volume of lean and weathered ore stockpiled will be processed within the next year.
It is expected that it will take more than one year to process this stockpile, depending on the Groups future mining activities, processing capabilities and anticipated market conditions.
As a consequence, the entire balance is classified as non-current in the Groups consolidated statement of financial position for the financial year ended 31 December 2016.
As at 31 December 2016, the lean and weathered ore is valued at cost and the calculated net realisable value for both is above the expected cost if converted into pellets or concentrate.
As a result of the continued devaluation of the UAH, the carrying value of the extracted and stockpiled ore is expected to fall further.
A potential trigger for any future impairment would be any change to the Groups plans in respect of the completion of the capacity upgrade programme at FPM.
Taxes recoverable During the financial years 2013, 2014 and 2015 current VAT was only refunded against corporate profit tax prepayments.
As a consequence, the balance of prepaid corporate profit tax in Ukraine significantly increased during these years and was subject to considerable translation adjustments during the financial years 2014 and 2015, when the Ukrainian Hryvnia devalued by 97% and 52%.
As at 31 December 2016, the balance amounted to US$16,246 thousand 2015: US$54,482 thousand after utilisation of US$6,335 thousand for the financial year 2016 and refunds received in cash totalling US$26,926 thousand during the financial year 2016.
Management is of the view that the remaining balance of prepaid corporate profit tax will be offset with future profits or will be refunded in cash during the next 12 months.
See also Note 15 for further details.
Deferred income tax Deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences and available tax loss carry forwards when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered in a future period.
A deviation between expected and effective future taxable profits in the different local jurisdictions may have an adverse impact on the recognised deferred tax balances in the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Assumptions about the generation of expected future taxable profits depend on managements estimates of future cash flows, which depend on estimates of future production and sales volumes, commodity prices, reserves, operating costs, closure and rehabilitation costs, capital expenditure, dividends and other capital management transactions.
Judgement is also required about the application of income tax legislation in the different jurisdictions, mainly in Ukraine.
At 31 December 2016, the Groups consolidated financial statements showed deferred tax assets of US$52,818 thousand 2015: US$71,096 thousand and deferred tax liabilities of US$586 thousand 2015: US$382 thousand.
The balance of deferred tax assets includes the effect of US$25,938 thousand from the recognition of a temporary difference in respect of the allowance recorded for restricted cash and deposit balances not available to the Group as a result of the insolvency of the Groups transactional bank in Ukraine.
This charge is currently not tax deductible in Ukraine, but the Group is confident that the charge will be tax deductible in future periods based on the current legislation and that it will be used to offset future profits generated in Ukraine.
See also Note 15 for details on the recognised deferred taxes and Note 35 in respect of an ongoing legal case for the full recognition of the cash and deposit balances held at the transactional bank by its Liquidator.
Net investments in foreign operations Throughout the Group there are various intercompany balances between subsidiaries, including loans that are used to finance mainly capital expenditure projects as well as working capital requirements.
The vast majority of these loans are denominated in US Dollars and are translated into the respective local functional currencies in the subsidiaries local accounts.
Loans for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future are, in substance, a part of the Groups net investment in that foreign operation and translation differences on these loans are recognised in other comprehensive income translation reserve and only reclassified from the translation reserve to profit or loss on disposal of the respective net investment.
It is the Group managements view that the total balance of the loans granted by the Group to its Ukrainian subsidiaries qualifies as net investment in its foreign operations and the translation losses totalling US$121,261 thousand for the financial year 2016 2015: US$472,492 thousand are consequently recognised in other comprehensive income.
The translation losses are a result of the continued devaluation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia compared to the US Dollar.
During the financial year 2016, the Ukrainian Hryvnia has devalued by approximately 13% 2015: 52% compared to the US Dollar from 24.001 as at 31 December 2015 to 27.191 as at the end of this reporting period.
10 2 FERREXPO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Note 5: Segment information The Group is managed as a single entity, which produces, develops and markets its principal product, iron ore pellets, for sale to the metallurgical industry.
While the revenue generated by the Group is monitored at a more detailed level, there are no separate measures of profit reported to the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments, the Group presents its results in a single segment, which are disclosed in the income statement for the Group.
Management monitors the operating result of the Group based on a number of measures including EBITDA, C1 costs and the net financial indebtedness.
EBITDA The Group presents EBITDA because it believes that EBITDA is a useful measure for evaluating its ability to generate cash and its operating performance.
The Groups full definition of EBITDA is disclosed in the Glossary on page 165.

The Groups net financial indebtedness was increased in the second half of the financial year 2015 by the insolvency of the Groups transactional bank in Ukraine resulting in a reduction of the balance of cash and cash equivalents available in Ukraine see Note 29.
Disclosure of revenue and non-current assets The Group does not generate significant revenues from external customers attributable to the United Kingdom, the Companys country of domicile.
The information on the revenues from external customers attributed to the individual foreign countries is given in Note 6.
The Group does not have any significant non-current assets that are located in the country of domicile of the Company.
The vast majority of the non-current assets are located in Ukraine.
FERREXPO PLC 10 3 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 6: Revenue Accounting policy Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
The following specific recognition criteria are to be met before revenue is recognised: Sale of goods including pellet sales Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, customs duties and sales taxes.
Risks and rewards of the ownership of goods pass when title for the goods passes to the customer as determined by the terms of the sales agreement.
The sales are typically made under the following terms: CIF Cost Insurance and Freight : CFR Cost and Freight : DAP Delivery At Place : or FOB Free on Board.
Under the CFR and FOB terms the title passes on the bill of lading date whereas under the other terms revenue is recognised when goods arrive at agreed destination or at border crossing.
If the sales agreement allows for adjustment of the sales prices based on survey of the goods by the customer e. g. ore content the revenue is recognised based on the most recent determined productspecification.
Logistic services Revenue from logistic services rendered is recognised as the services are completed.
Where services are invoiced in advance of discharge, amounts attributable to the time between the end of the reporting period and the discharge date are deferred.
Other sales and services provided include predominantly the revenue generated from the sale of other materials, such as gravel, and repair and maintenance works provided to third parties.
The revenues are recognised when the title passes for material sold or services provided are completed.
Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2016 consisted of the following: Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.16 31.12.15 Revenue from sales of iron ore pellets and concentrate: Export 921,861 895,520 Total revenue from sale of iron ore pellets and concentrate 921,861 895,520 Revenue from logistics and bunker business 61,207 61,247 Revenue from other sales and services provided 3,257 4,236 Total revenue 986,325 961,003 10 4 FERREXPO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Note 6: Revenue continued Export sales of iron ore pellets and concentrate by geographical destination showing separately countries that individually represented more than 10% of export sales in either current or prior year were as follows: Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.16 31.12.15 Central Europe 425,079 431,429 Austria 215,479 188,284 Slovakia 48,397 96,211 Others 161,203 146,934 Western Europe 153,932 105,858 Germany 143,281 102,985 Others 10,651 2,873 North East Asia 155,443 119,170 Japan 96,257 86,343 Others 59,186 32,827 China and South East Asia 129,391 193,566 China 125,788 193,566 Others 3,603 Turkey, Middle East and India 58,016 45,497 Turkey 58,016 45,497 Total exports 921,861 895,520 The Group markets its products across various regions.

FERREXPO PLC 10 7 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 12: Foreign exchange gains and losses Accounting policy Foreign exchange gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
Operating foreign exchange gains and losses are those resulting directly from the Groups operating activities.
Non-operating gains and losses are predominantly those associated with the Groups financing and treasury activities including the translation of interest-bearing loans and borrowings denominated in currencies different from the respective functional currencies and transactional gains and losses from the conversion of cash balances in currencies different from the local functional currencies at exchange rates different from those at the initial recognition date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses for the year ended 31 December 2016 consisted of the following: Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.16 31.12.15 Operating foreign exchange gains losses Revaluation of trade receivables 14,240 25,943 Revaluation of trade payables 388 118 Other 20 36 Total operating foreign exchange gains 13,832 26,025 Non-operating foreign exchange losses gains Revaluation of interest-bearing loans 11,577 39,858 Conversion of cash and cash equivalents 578 26,368 Other 1,844 4,260 Total non-operating foreign exchange losses gains 10,311 17,750 Total foreign exchange gains 3,521 8,275 During the financial year 2016, the Ukrainian Hryvnia has devalued by approximately 13% 2015: 52% compared to the US Dollar from 24.001 as at 31 December 2015 to 27.191 as at the end of this reporting period.
Note 13: Write-offs and impairment losses Accounting policy The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there are indications that assets may be impaired or previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the assets recoverable amounts.
If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement.
Further information on the annual impairment testing of goodwill is provided in Note 18.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
In this case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount, but not exceeding the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the income statement and the basis for future depreciation is adjusted accordingly.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Write-offs and impairment losses for the year ended 31 December 2016 consisted of the following: Year ended Year ended US$000 Notes 31.12.16 31.12.15 Write-off of receivables and prepayments 634 4,598 Write-off write-back of inventories 20 33 59 Write-off of property, plant and equipment 17 1,822 992 Impairment of available-for-sale investments 31 12 24 Total write-offs and impairment losses 2,501 5,555 The write-off of receivables and prepayments during the comparative period ended 31 December 2015 is predominantly related to the cancellation of a contract for equipment ordered and partially prepaid in line with the terms of the contract.
10 8 FERREXPO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Note 14: Finance income and expense Accounting policy Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and the effect of unwinding discounts recorded in previous periods.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method.
Finance expense is expensed as incurred and includes the interest on loans and borrowings and defined benefit plans.
Finance expense also include bank charges, such as arrangement fees, charged in relation to the Groups major debt facilities.
Finance expense also comprises the effect from discounting receivable balances including overdue VAT balances expected to be received more than 12 months after the period end.
Borrowing costs incurred in respect of the financing of construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised up to the date when the asset is ready for its intended use.
See also Note 17 for further details.
Finance income and expense for the year ended 31 December 2016 consisted of the following: Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.16 31.12.15 Finance income Interest income 175 1,268 Other finance income 1,226 Total finance income 175 2,494 Finance expense Interest expense on financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 54,255 61,505 Effect from capitalised borrowing costs 5,269 5,440 Interest on defined benefit plans 2,197 2,880 Bank charges 11,372 12,282 Other finance costs 4,622 570 Total finance expense 67,177 71,797 Net finance expense 67,002 69,303 Fees for liability management activities of the Group for the amount of US$4,554 thousand 2015: nil are included in other finance costs.
Note 15: Taxation Accounting policy Current income tax Current income taxes are computed based on enacted or substantively enacted local tax rates and laws at the reporting date and the expected taxable incomes of the subsidiaries for the respective period.
Current income taxes are recognised as an expense or income in the consolidated income statement unless related to items recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity or if related to the initial accounting for a businesscombination.
Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for taxable temporary differences, if it is probable that they become taxable.
Deferred income tax assets are generally recognised for deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
No deferred assets or liabilities are recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction, other than in a business combination, which affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
FERREXPO PLC 10 9 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 15: Taxation continued Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets in relation to temporary differences on such investments and interests are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there are sufficient taxable profits available against which the benefits of the temporary differences can be utilised and that they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax assets to be utilised.
Additionally, unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.
Income tax effects on items directly recognised in other comprehensive income or equity are also recognised in other comprehensive income or equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
The income tax expense for the year ended 31 December 2016 consisted of the following: Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.16 31.12.15 Current income tax Current income tax charge 40,542 34,180 Amounts related to previous years 1,440 189 Total current income tax 41,982 33,991 Deferred income tax Origination and reversal of temporary differences 216 40,099 Effect from changes in tax laws and rates Total deferred income tax 216 40,099 Total income tax expense credit 42,198 6,108 The amounts related to prior year are predominantly in relation to an allowance on an income tax receivable balance totalling US$2,115 thousand that was recognised during the comparative period ended 31 December 2015.
As a result of the assessment made by the relevant tax authorities during the financial year 2016, an allowance for the full amount was recorded as at 31 December 2016.
Other comprehensive income contained taxes on the following items charged or credited to it for the year ended 31 December 2016: Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.16 31.12.15 Tax effect of exchange differences arising on translating foreign operations 16,607 40,978 Tax effect of remeasurement gains on defined pension liability 246 722 Total income taxes charged to other comprehensive income 16,361 40,256 The weighted average statutory corporate income tax rate is calculated as the average of the statutory tax rates applicable in the countries in which the Group operates, weighted by the profits and losses before tax of the subsidiaries in the respective countries, as included in the consolidated financial information.
The weighted average statutory corporate income tax rate before special items was 8.9% for the financial year 2016 2015: 12.4%.
The rate for the comparative period ended 31 December 2015 excludes the tax effect of the non-recurring charge related to the restricted cash and deposits balances see Note 29, which, if included, would have resulted in a negative weighted averaged statutory corporate income tax rate.
The income tax credit of US$6,108 thousand for the comparative period ended 31 December 2015 results from a deferred tax credit of US$28,420 thousand relating to the recognition of a deferred tax asset in respect of the allowance for the restricted cash and deposits for which the Group expects that it will become tax deductible in a future period.
110 FERREXPO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Note 15: Taxation continued A reconciliation between the income tax charged in the accompanying financial information and income before taxes multiplied by the weighted average statutory tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2016 is as follows: Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.16 31.12.15 Profit before tax 231,398 25,350 Notional tax charge computed at the weighted average statutory tax rate of 8.9% 2015: 12.4% 20,594 3,142 Effect of higher local tax rate on special items 1,003 11,987 Reassessment of prior year temporary differences 1,148 657 Effect from utilisation of non-recognised deferred tax assets 2,165 1 Expenses not deductible for local tax purposes 7,828 7,383 Income exempted for local tax purposes 1,588 5,168 2 Income for local tax purposes 7,767 3 Non-recognition of deferred taxes on current year losses 4,552 3,634 4 Tax related to prior years 1,440 189 5 Other including translation differences 1,460 101 Total income tax expense credit 42,198 6,108 Reconciliation of tax effect on special items: Loss before tax on special items 11,026 138,749 Notional tax credit computed at the weighted average statutory tax rate of 8.9% 2015: 12.4% 981 17,197 Effect of higher local tax rate on special items 1,003 11,987 Effect from utilisation of non-recognised deferred tax assets 2,165 Effect from change in permanent differences 449 688 Non-recognition of deferred tax asset 2,241 Tax credit on special items 1,535 28,420 1 Predominantly related to Ukraine where certain operating expenses are historically not deductible for tax purposes according to the enacted local tax legislation.
2 Reconciling item relates to an adjustment made in Ukraine in respect of sales of pellets to subsidiaries of the Group abroad in order to address the changes in the local transfer pricing law.
3 Non-recognition of deferred taxes on current year losses due to the uncertainty in respect of the timing of the subsidiaries becoming profitable for local tax purposes.
4 Predominantly in relation to an allowance on an income tax receivable balance of US$2,115 thousand that was recognised during the comparative period ended 31 December 2015 and fully provided for following the assessment made by the relevant tax authorities.
5 Increase during the financial year 2016 related to an increase of the tax expense in Ukraine.
The net balance of income tax receivable changed as follows during the financial year 2016: Year ended Year ended US$000 Notes 31.12.16 31.12.15 Opening balance 49,150 67,884 Income statement charge 41,982 33,991 Charge through other comprehensive income 26,966 28,811 Tax refund paid 24,438 11,054 Translation differences 2 5,089 24,608 Closing balance 4,607 49,150 During the financial years 2013, 2014 and 2015, current VAT receivable balances in Ukraine were mainly recovered in exchange for prepayments of corporate profit tax.
As at 31 December 2016, these prepayments totalled US$16,246 thousand 2015: US$54,482 thousand and it is managements view that this balance will be offset with future profits or will be refunded in cash.
The Group received refunds of prepaid corporate profit tax totalling US$26,926 thousand in July and December 2016 in respect of Ferrexpo Poltava Mining FPM.
As a result, the remaining balance of FPM of US$10,616 thousand as at 31 December 2016 is classified as current whereas US$5,630 thousand related to two other Ukrainian subsidiaries are classified as non-current due to the uncertainty in respect of the timing of the recovery.

US$217,560 thousand are related to losses incurred in Ukraine and Austria and those losses do not expire.
The remaining balance of available tax loss carry forwards totalling US$23,510 thousand relates to losses incurred in Hungary of which US$20,564 thousand expire after more than tenyears.
Temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised amount to US$491,963 thousand 2015: US$370,886 thousand.
Other temporary differences of US$9,720 thousand have not been recognised as of 31 December 2016, of which the vast majority relates to temporary differences on property, plant and equipment in Ukraine.
112 FERREXPO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Note 16: Earnings per share and dividends paid and proposed Accounting policy Basic number of Ordinary Shares outstanding The basic number of Ordinary Shares is calculated by reducing the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue by the weighted average of shares held in treasury and employee benefit trust reserve.
The basic earnings per share EPS are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of Ferrexpo plc by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares.
Dilutive potential Ordinary Shares The dilutive potential Ordinary Shares outstanding are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all potentially dilutive Ordinary Shares.
All share awards that are potentially dilutive are considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs for qualifying assets see below if the recognition criteria are met.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
Major spare parts and servicing equipment qualify as property, plant and equipment when they are expected to be used during more than one period.
Expenditure incurred after the assets have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance and overhaul costs, are charged to the income statement in the period the costs are incurred unless it can be demonstrated that the expenditure results in future economic benefits, the expenditure is capitalised as an additional cost.
Upon recognition, items of property, plant and equipment are divided into components, which represent items with a significant value that have different useful lives.
Assets included in property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful life taking into account their own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the asset are located.
The remaining useful lives for major assets are reassessed on a regular basis.
Changes in estimates, which affect the unit of production calculations, are accounted for prospectively.
Except for mining assets, which are depreciated using the unit of production method, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, as follows: Buildings: 2050 years Vessels: 3040 years Plant and equipment: 315 years Vehicles: 715 years Fixtures and fittings: 2.510 years An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item is included in the income statement in the period the item is derecognised.
Assets in the course of construction are initially recognised in assets under construction.
Assets under construction are not depreciated.
On completion of the asset and when available for use, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate asset category in property, plant and equipment and depreciation commences.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Stripping costs included in mining assets and assets under construction Stripping costs in relation to mine exploration, evaluation and development costs incurred are capitalised and included in assets under construction up to the commencement of the production of the mine or area in the mine.
Stripping work comprises overburden removal at the pre-production, mine extension and production stages.
After the commencement of production, the respective capitalised pre-production stripping costs are transferred to mining assets and depreciated using the unit of production method based on the estimated economically recoverable reserves to which they relate.
The production stripping costs are generally charged to the income statement as variable production costs.
The production stripping costs are only capitalised if a stripping activity results in improved access to a component ore body.
If capitalised, the production stripping costs are included in mining assets and depreciated using the same methodology as for the capitalised pre-production stripping costs.
The cost of removal of the waste material during a mines production phase is expensed as incurred.
114 FERREXPO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Note 17: Property, plant and equipment continued Exploration and evaluation assets Costs incurred in relation to the exploration and evaluation of potential iron ore deposits are capitalised and classified as tangible or intangible assets depending on the nature of the expenditures.
Costs associated with exploratory drilling, researching and analysing of exploration data and costs of pre-feasibility studies are included in tangible assets whereas those associated with the acquisition of licences are included in intangible assets.
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditures are carried forward as an asset as long as these costs are expected to be recouped in full through successful development and exploration in a future period.
Exploration and evaluation assets are measured at cost and are neither amortised nor depreciated, but monitored for indications of impairment.
To the extent that the capitalised expenditures are not expected to be recouped the excess is fully provided for in the financial year in which this is determined.
Upon reaching the development stage, exploration and evaluation assets are either transferred to assets under construction or other intangible assets, if those costs were associated with the acquisition of licences.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset.
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur.
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that incurred in connection with the borrowing of the funds.
In the case of general borrowings used to fund the acquisition or construction of a qualifying asset, the borrowing costs to be capitalised are calculated based on a weighted average interest rate applicable to the relevant general borrowings of the Group during a specific period.
See also Note 13 in respect of write-offs and impairments.
Once production commences, stripping costs are transferred to mining assets.
Property, plant and equipment includes capitalised borrowing costs on qualifying assets of US$15,454 thousand 2015: US$13,021 thousand.
The capitalised borrowing costs on general borrowings were determined based on the capitalisation rate of 7.8% 2015: 6.3%, which is the average effective interest rate on general borrowings during the period.
The Group has no specific borrowings in relation to qualifying assets during either reporting period.
The carrying value of equipment held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts at 31 December 2016 was US$2,746 thousand 2015: US$4,396 thousand.
Leased assets and assets under hire purchase contracts are pledged as security for the related finance leases and hire purchase liabilities.
US$47,236 thousand of property, plant and equipment have been pledged as security for liabilities 2015: US$69,340 thousand.
The gross value of fully depreciated property, plant and equipment that is still in use is US$20,553 thousand 2015:US$20,461thousand.
Note 18: Goodwill and other intangible assets Accounting policy Goodwill If the cost of acquisition in a business combination exceeds the identifiable net assets attributable to the Group, the difference is considered as purchased goodwill, which is not amortised but annually reviewed for impairment or in case of an indication of impairment.
In the case that the identifiable net assets attributable to the Group exceed the cost of acquisition, the difference is recognised in profit and loss as a gain on bargain purchase.
For each business combination, the Group measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
If the initial accounting for a business combination cannot be completed by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, only provisional amounts are reported, which can be adjusted during the measurement period of 12 months after acquisition date.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill from business combinations is not amortised, but reviewed for impairment at every balance sheet date and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is never reversed in a subsequent period.
Exploration and evaluation assets See policy disclosed in Note 17.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost and the useful lives are assessed as either finite or indefinite.
Following the initial recognition, the intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
If amortised, the intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, ranging between one and three years.
Capitalised mineral licences are amortised on a unit of production basis.
The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is its fair value as at the date of acquisition.
FERREXPO PLC 117 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 18: Goodwill and other intangible assets continued As at 31 December 2016, goodwill and other intangible assets comprised: Other Exploration intangible US$000 Goodwill and evaluation assets Total Cost: At 1 January 2015 50,009 4,664 8,861 63,534 Additions 685 685 Disposals 51 51 Translation differences 17,071 1,600 2,745 21,416 At 31 December 2015 32,938 3,064 6,750 42,752 Additions 378 378 Disposals 87 87 Translation differences 3,905 359 726 4,990 At 31 December 2016 29,033 2,705 6,315 38,053 Accumulated amortisation and impairment: At 1 January 2015 3,066 3,066 Amortisation charge 494 494 Disposals 50 50 Translation differences 782 782 At 31 December 2015 2,728 2,728 Amortisation charge 438 438 Disposals 74 74 Translation differences 259 259 At 31 December 2016 2,833 2,833 Net book value at: 31 December 2015 32,938 3,064 4,022 40,024 31 December 2016 29,033 2,705 3,482 35,220 The goodwill acquired through business combinations in previous periods has been allocated for impairment purposes to one cashgenerating unit, as the Group only has one operating segment, being the production and sale of iron ore.
This represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The major component of other intangible assets comprises mining licences and purchased software.
Impairment testing Impairment testing was performed at 31 December 2016 based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections over the remaining estimated lives of the GPL and the Yeristovskoye deposits, which are expected to expire in 2038 and 2037, respectively, according to the current approved mine plans.
The estimated production volumes are based on these mine plans and do not take into account the effects of expected future mine life extension programmes.
The cash flow projection is based on a financial long-term model approved by the senior management covering the expected life of the mines.
The production capacity remains at a fixed level once full capacity is reached and therefore no perpetual growth rate is applied for the cash flow projections beyond this point of time.
118 FERREXPO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Note 18: Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The key assumptions used for the impairment testing are: Estimates assumptions Basis Future production: Proved and probable reserves and resource estimates Commodity prices: Contract prices and longer-term price estimates Cost of raw materials and other production distribution costs: Expected future costs Exchange rates: Current market exchange rates Discount rates: Cost of capital risk adjusted for the resource concerned Cash flows are projected based on managements expectations regarding the development of the iron ore and steel market and the cost of producing and distributing the pellets.
The Group takes into account two key assumptions, selling price and total production costs.
Within this, both macro and local factors which influence these are considered.
In determining the future long-term selling price, the Group takes into account external and internal analysis of the longer-term and shorter-term supply and demand dynamics in the local region and throughout the world along with costs of production of competitors and the marginal cost of incremental production in a particular market.
The Group considers local supply demand balances affecting its major customers and the effects this could have on the longer-term price.
The assumptions for iron ore prices ranged from US$55 per tonne to US$62 per tonne of 62% Fe fines CFR North China 2015: US$48 per tonne to US$65 per tonne.
Cost of production and shipping is considered taking into account local inflationary pressures, major exchange rate developments between local currency and the US Dollar, and the longer-term and shorter-term trends in energy supply and demand and the effect on costs along with the expected movements in steel-related commodity prices, which affect the cost of certain production inputs.
For the purpose of the goodwill impairment test, the future cash flows were discounted using the real pre-tax discount rate of 14.0% 2015: 14.0% per annum.
These rates reflect the time value of money and risk associated with the asset, and are in line with the rates used by competitors with a similar background.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Management believes that due to the available headroom resulting from the Groups impairment testing of its operating assets no reasonable change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of these operating assets to materially exceed its value-in-use.

Note 25: Pension and post-employment obligations Accounting policy The defined benefit costs relating to the plans operated by the Group in the different countries are determined and accrued in the consolidated financial statements using the projected unit credit method for those employees entitled to such payments.
The underlying assumptions are defined by management and the defined benefit pension liability is calculated by independent actuaries at the end of each annual reporting period.
Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, are immediately reflected in the statement of financial position.
The corresponding charge or credit is recognised in the other comprehensive income of the period in which it occurred and immediately reflected in retained earnings as not reclassified to the income statement in subsequent periods.
The costs of managing plan assets are deducted from the return on plan assets reflected in other comprehensive income.
All other scheme administration costs are charged to the income statement.
The net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit pension liability or plan assets.
Any past service costs are recognised in the income statement at the earlier of when the plan amendment occurs or when related restructuring costs are recognised.
The service costs including current and past are included in cost of sales, selling and distribution expenses and general and administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement whereas the net finance expenses are included in finance expenses.
The effects from remeasurements are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The defined benefit pension liability is the aggregate of the defined benefit obligation less plan assets of funded schemes.
The Group operates funded and unfunded schemes.
The Groups expenses in relation to defined contribution plans are charged directly to the income statement.
The Group mainly operates defined benefit plans for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in Ukraine and Switzerland.
All local defined benefit pension liabilities are calculated by independent actuaries applying accepted actuarial techniques.
In addition to the afore mentioned schemes, the Group operates a defined benefit scheme in Austria and contribution plans for qualifying employees in the United Kingdom and in Singapore.

The methods and assumptions used for the sensitivity analysis for the prior year are unchanged.
Note 26: Provisions Accounting policy General Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Site restoration Site restoration provisions are made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure and restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs determined by an independent expert in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs.
The provision is discounted, if material, and the unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs.
At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future benefit and depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates.
The provision is reviewed on an annual basis for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or the life ofoperations.
The provision for site restoration changed as follows during the financial year 2016: Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.16 31.12.15 Opening balance 975 2,345 Unwind of the discount 141 253 Arising during the year 76 Released 834 Translation differences 121 789 Closing balance 1,071 975 The costs of restoration of the different deposits in the Groups open pit mines are based on amounts determined by an independent and credited institute taking into account the codes of practice and laws applicable in Ukraine.
The useful lives of the different pits and mines are determined by the same institute based on expected annual stripping and production volumes having taken into account the expected timing and effect of future mine-life extension programmes.
It is expected that the restoration works of the GPL mine will start after the years 2038, 2041 and 2061 depending on the different areas within the mine.
The first restoration work of the Yeristovskoye mine is expected to start after 2032.
The provision represents the discounted value of the estimated costs of decommissioning and restoring the mines at the dates when the deposits are expected to be depleted in the relevant areas within the mine.
The present value of the provision has been calculated using a nominal pre-tax discount rate of 16.0% 2015: 16.0% and the costs are expected to be incurred once the restoration works begin in the different areas of the mines.
Uncertainties in estimating the provision include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives and the discount and inflation rates to be used in the calculations.

Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities e. g. promissory notes, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings and trade and other payables.
Derivative financial instruments The Group does not hold any derivative financial instruments.
Initial measurement Non-derivative financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Any transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets or financial liabilities are added or deducted from its fair value except for financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement.
For those financial assets and financial liabilities, the transactions costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date i. e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Regular way purchases or sales are those that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
The subsequent measurement is based on the classification of the financial instruments.
Subsequent measurement Financial assets Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired along with the amortisation process.
Available-for-sale investments All investments, except for investments in associates, are classified as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are not classified as loans or receivables, held-to-maturity investments or financial assets at fair value through the income statement.
If the fair value can be reliably determined, subsequent measurement of available-for-sale financial assets is made on a fair value basis with unrealised gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income in the net unrealised gains reserve until the investment is derecognised.
On derecognition or when determined to be impaired, the cumulative gains or losses are to be recognised, at which time the cumulative net effect is to be reclassified from the reserve to the income statement.
The fair value of investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted market bid prices at the close of business on the reporting date.
For investments without an active market, the fair value is determined using other valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models and reference to recent transaction prices.
If the fair value of an availablefor-sale equity investment cannot be reliably measured, the investment is measured at cost less any impairment losses.
Other Other non-derivative financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
Financial liabilities Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
13 0 FERREXPO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Note 31: Financial instruments continued Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced either directly or through use of an allowance account.
The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.
If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and it is objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is to be reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
Available-for-sale investments The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an investment or a group of investments is impaired.
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost.
Where there is evidence of impairment, the cumulative loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is to be reclassified from the reserve to the income statement.
Impairment losses on available-for-sale investments are not reversed through the income statement.
The increases in their fair values after impairment are recognised directly in the statement of other comprehensive income.
The accounting classification of each category of financial instruments, and their carrying amounts, are set out below: As at 31.12.16 Financial Availableliabilities for-sale measured at Loans and financial amortised US$000 Notes receivables assets cost Total Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 28 144,751 144,751 Restricted cash and deposits 29 Trade and other receivables 21 81,745 81,745 Other financial assets 9,700 9,700 Total financial assets 236,196 236,196 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables 24 28,807 28,807 Accrued liabilities 27 12,540 12,540 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 30 733,702 733,702 Total financial liabilities 775,049 775,049 FERREXPO PLC 131 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 31: Financial instruments continued As at 31.12.15 Financial Availableliabilities for-sale measured at Loans and financial amortised US$000 Notes receivables assets cost Total Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 28 35,330 35,330 Restricted cash and deposits 29 9,308 9,308 Trade and other receivables 21 83,379 83,379 Other financial assets 5,757 9 5,766 Total financial assets 133,774 9 133,783 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables 24 27,566 27,566 Accrued liabilities 27 14,223 14,223 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 30 903,650 903,650 Total financial liabilities 945,439 945,439 Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk: liquidity risk: market risk including currency and commodity risk.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee and the CFO.
The Group operates a centralised financial risk management structure under the management of the Executive Committee, accountable to the Board.
The Executive Committee delegates certain responsibilities to the CFO.
The CFOs responsibilities include authority for approving all new physical, commercial or financial transactions that create a financial risk for the Group.
Additionally, the CFO controls the management of treasury risks within each of the business units in accordance with a Board-approved Treasury Policy.
Financial instrument risk exposure and management Natural hedges that can be identified and their effectiveness quantified are used in preference to financial risk management instruments.
Derivative transactions may be executed for risk mitigation purposes only speculation is not permitted under the approved Treasury Policy and are designed to have the effect of reducing risk on underlying market or credit exposures.
Appropriate operational controls ensure operational risks are not increased disproportionately to the reduction in market or credit risk.
The Group has not used any financial risk management instruments that are derivative in nature, or other hedging instruments, in this or prior periods.
13 2 FERREXPO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Note 31: Financial instruments continued Credit risk Trade and other receivables The Group through its trading operations enters into binding contracts, which contain obligations that create exposure to credit, counterparty and country risks.
It is the primary objective of the Group to manage such risks to reduce uncertainty of collection from buyers.
A secondary objective is to minimise the cost of reducing risks within acceptable parameters.
Trade finance is used to balance risk and payment.
These risks include the creditworthiness of the buyer, and the political and economic stability of the buyers country.
Trade finance generally refers to the financing of individual transactions or a series of revolving transactions and are often self-liquidating, whereby the lending bank stipulates that all sales proceeds to be collected are applied to settle the loan, the remainder returned to the Group.
Trade finance transactions are approved by the Group Treasurer.
The primary objective is to ensure that the margins paid and conditions applicable should be the same as, or better than, those which other organisations with similar creditworthiness would achieve, and compared with other financing available to the Group.
Credit risk is the risk associated with the possibility that a buyer will default, by failing to make required payments in a timely manner or to comply with other conditions of an obligation or agreement.
Where appropriate, the Group uses letters of credit to assist in mitigating such risks.
Counterparty risk crystallises when a party to an agreement defaults.
Where letters of credit are used to minimise this risk, the Group uses a confirming bank with a similar or higher credit rating to mitigate country and or credit risk of the issuing bank.
Country risk is the potential volatility of foreign assets, whether receivables or investments, that is due to political and or financial events in a given country.
Group Treasury monitors the concentration of all outstanding risks associated with any entity or country, and reports to the Group CFO on a timely basis.
Investment securities Outside Ukraine the Group limits its cash exposure to credit, counterparty and country risk by only investing in liquid securities and with counterparties that are incorporated in an A or better S&P rated OECD country.
A ratings approach is used to determine maximum exposure to each counterparty.
Cash not required within three months for production, distribution and capital expenditures is invested with counterparties rated by S&P or Moodys at a level of long-term BBB S&P or short-term A3 S&P or better.
Recognising that the principal activities of the Group are predominantly in Ukraine, special consideration is given to Ukrainian transactional banking counterparties where the sector is small and constrained by the sovereign credit rating.
Exceptions may be made under the following conditions: the counterparty is resident in Ukraine: and the counterparty is included in the top 15 financial institutions in Ukraine based on the Groups assessment of the financial institution.
Subsequent to the declaration of insolvency of Bank F&C see Note 29 and Note 35, the Group changed its transactional banking arrangements that had previously been with Bank F&C to third party banks in Ukraine.
The Group is currently working with five banks in Ukraine, all of them being subsidiaries of Western banks, and is still exposed to Ukraine country and banking sector risk in this respect.
Guarantees The Groups policy is to provide financial guarantees under limited circumstances only for the benefit of wholly owned or substantially wholly owned subsidiaries.
At 31 December 2016, Ferrexpo AG, Ferrexpo Finance plc and Ferrexpo Middle East FZE were jointly and severally liable under a US$350 million revolving pre-export finance facility, which was fully drawn as of 31 December 2016.
Ferrexpo plc, Ferrexpo AG and Ferrexpo Middle East FZE are guarantors to the Eurobond Notes issued by Ferrexpo Finance plc totalling US$346,385 thousand, which is due for repayment on 7 April 2018 and 2019, respectively.
Additionally, the Notes benefit from a surety agreement provided by FPM.
Certain Group companies act as guarantors for several finance facilities provided to Ukrainian subsidiaries: Ferrexpo AG amounting to US$63,465 thousand 2015: US$87,904 thousand, Ferrexpo Middle East FZE amounting to US$25,108 thousand 2015: US$34,365 thousand and Ferrexpo plc amounting to US$13,307 thousand 2015: US$18,629 thousand.
The total remaining contractual maturities of the guarantees provided under the facilities listed above is US$736,265 thousand 2015: US$913,215 thousand.
FERREXPO PLC 13 3 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 31: Financial instruments continued Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: As at As at US$000 31.12.16 31.12.15 Cash and cash equivalents 144,751 35,330 Restricted cash and deposits 9,308 Trade and other receivables 81,745 83,379 Other financial assets 9,700 5,757 Total maximum exposure to credit risk 236,196 133,774 The carrying amount of restricted cash and deposits is shown net of an allowance for cash and deposits held at Bank F&C, which are currently not available to the Group.
See Note 29 for further information.
Of the total maximum exposure to credit risk, US$47,025 thousand 2015: US$36,611 thousand related to Ukraine.
The total receivables balance relating to the Groups top three customers was US$21,766 thousand 2015: US$18,588 thousand making up 30.8% of the total amounts receivable 2015: 41.7%.
Impairment profile The Groups exposure to credit risk relating to trade and other receivables is disclosed in Note 21.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation by holding surplus cash or undrawn committed credit facilities.
The Group prepares detailed rolling cash flow forecasts, which assist it in monitoring cash flow requirements and optimising its cash return on investments.
Typically the Group intends to ensure that it has sufficient cash on demand and or lines of credit to meet expected operational expenses, including the servicing of financial obligations: this may be impacted by extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities: As at 31.12.16 Less than Between Between More than US$000 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years 5 years Total Interest-bearing Eurobond issued 168,842 168,842 337,684 Syndicated loans secured 175,000 131,250 306,250 Other banks secured 18,310 16,160 9,274 43,744 Other banks unsecured 1,495 1,495 3,752 6,742 Obligation under finance lease 3,684 3,956 2,069 9,709 Interest accrued 10,548 10,548 Trade finance facilities 19,025 19,025 Future interest payable 47,380 30,489 9,308 87,177 Total interest-bearing 275,442 352,192 193,245 820,879 Non-interest-bearing Trade and other payables 28,807 28,807 Accrued liabilities 12,540 12,540 Total non-interest-bearing 41,347 41,347 Total financial liabilities 316,789 352,192 193,245 862,226 13 4 FERREXPO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Note 31: Financial instruments continued As at 31.12.15 Less than Between Between More than US$000 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years 5 years Total Interest-bearing Eurobond issued 333,536 333,536 Syndicated loans secured 166,250 175,000 131,250 472,500 Other banks secured 21,504 18,397 25,470 65,371 Other banks unsecured 1,431 1,558 4,482 899 8,370 Obligation under finance lease 3,444 3,698 6,061 13,203 Interest accrued 10,670 10,670 Future interest payable 52,353 46,404 39,510 6 138,273 Total interest-bearing 255,652 245,057 540,309 905 1,041,923 Non-interest-bearing Trade and other payables 27,566 27,566 Accrued liabilities 14,223 14,223 Total non-interest-bearing 41,789 41,789 Total financial liabilities 297,441 245,057 540,309 905 1,083,712 Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of the Group.
Functional currencies for the Group are primarily the Ukrainian Hryvnia, but also US Dollars, Swiss Francs, Euro and UK Pounds Sterling.
The Groups major lines of borrowings and the majority of its sales are denominated in US Dollars, with costs of local Ukrainian production mainly in Hryvnia.
The value of the Hryvnia is published by the NBU.
The Group has a gross recoverable VAT balance of US$20,565 thousand UAH559,175 million and prepaid corporate profit tax of US$16,246 thousand UAH441,745 million to be recovered from the Ukrainian government tax authority and is reliant on the normal functioning of this system.
The exact timing of recovery is subject to uncertainties, along with the prevailing exchange rate to the US Dollar at the time of repayment.
As a result of the UAH devaluation during the financial year 2016, the recoverable gross VAT balance and prepaid corporate profit tax decreased by US$3,573 thousand 2015: US$25,613 thousand and US$5,059 thousand 2015: US$24,608 thousand, respectively, affecting the Groups cash flow from the refunds in US Dollars.
The devaluation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia reduced the operating costs of the production unit in US Dollar terms and the value of Hryvnia payables recorded in the statement of financial position at the year end in US Dollars.
As the majority of sales and receivables are denominated in US Dollars, a devaluation in the local currency will result in operating exchange gains recorded in the income statement.
With the devaluation of the local currency, US Dollar-denominated loans held by the Ukrainian subsidiary resulted in non-operating exchange losses to the extent these are not matched by US Dollar-denominated assets.
Fixed assets are similarly held in local currency amounts and the devaluation in the currency resulted in reduced net asset values with the effect recorded in the translation reserve.
The NBU manages and determines the official exchange rates.
An interbank market for exchange of currencies exists in Ukraine and is monitored by the NBU.
The Group, through financial institutions, exchanges currencies at bank offered market rates.
Trade receivables are predominately in US Dollars and are not hedged.
Trade payables denominated in US Dollars are also not hedged on the market, but are matched against US Dollar currency receipts.
This includes the interest expense, which is principally payable in US Dollars.
Trade receivables and trade payables in Ukrainian Hryvnia are not hedged as a forward market for the currency is generally not available.
Other Group monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are considered immaterial as the exposure to currency risk mainly relates to corporate costs within Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
FERREXPO PLC 13 5 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 31: Financial instruments continued The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows based on notional amounts: As at 31.12.16 Ukrainian US Swiss Other US$000 Hryvnia Dollars Euro Franc currencies Total Financial assets 1,172 207 768 2,226 4,373 Financial liabilities Other banks secured 24,789 37 24,826 Other banks unsecured 6,904 6,904 Obligation under finance lease 357 357 Interest accrued 246 246 Total borrowings 32,296 37 32,333 Trade and other payables 1,488 1,332 238 569 3,627 Accrued liabilities 2 20 982 1,004 Total financial liabilities 33,786 1,369 258 1,551 36,964 Net financial assets liabilities 32,614 1,162 510 675 32,591 As at 31.12.15 Ukrainian US Swiss Other US$000 Hryvnia Dollars Euro Franc currencies Total Financial assets 2 5,316 5,931 108 2,592 13,949 Financial liabilities Other banks secured 34,418 71 34,489 Other banks unsecured 8,439 8,439 Obligation under finance lease 74 74 Interest accrued 272 272 Total borrowings 43,203 71 43,274 Trade and other payables 2,592 1,097 206 386 4,281 Accrued liabilities 813 813 Total financial liabilities 45,795 1,168 206 1,199 48,368 Net financial assets liabilities 2 40,479 4,763 98 1,393 34,419 Interest rate risk The Group predominantly borrows bank funds that are at floating interest rates and is exposed to interest rate movements.
The interest rate exposure to US Dollars remained relatively low during the period, and no interest rate swaps have been entered into in this or priorperiods.
Commodity risk The Group is exposed to movements in the price of iron ore as an index-based pricing model is applied to long-term contracts.
These contracts have embedded provisional pricing mechanisms, which have the character of commodity derivatives that are carried at fair value through profit and loss.
As a consequence, trade receivables may have to be adjusted in a future period when final invoices can be issued based on changes in iron ore prices and the specific underlying contract terms.
Where pricing terms deviate from the index-based pricing model, derivative commodity contracts may be used to return the effective prices to the index.
Finished goods are held at cost without revaluation to a spot price for iron ore pellets at the end of the reporting period, as long as the recoverable amount exceeds the cost basis.
13 6 FERREXPO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Note 31: Financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis A 20% strengthening of the US Dollar against the following currencies at 31 December would have increased decreased income statement and equity by the amounts shown below.
This assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
Year ended Year ended 31.12.16 31.12.15 Income Income statement statement US$000 equity equity Ukrainian Hryvnia 5,436 6,746 Euro 194 794 Swiss Franc 85 16 Total 5,545 5,968 A 20% weakening of the US Dollar against the above currencies would have an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all the other variables remain constant.
Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the Group does not hold any derivatives e. g. interest rate swaps.
Therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the incomestatement.
Cash flow sensitivity for variable rate instruments An increase of 100 basis points bps in interest rates would have decreased equity and the consolidated result by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
Year ended Year ended US$000 31.12.16 31.12.15 Net finance charge 1,868 4,768 A decrease of 100bps would increase equity and profit by US$1,014 thousand for the year ended 31 December 2016 2015: increase of US$1,730 thousand.
This is on the basis that all the other variables remain constant.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base.
The Board of Directors monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the return on capital, which the Group defines as total shareholders equity, excluding non-controlling interests, and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
Please refer to the statement of changes in equity for details of the capital position of the Group.
The capital base of the Group can be adversely affected by falls in the price of iron ore reducing reported revenues and profitability.
The price that the industry earns for iron ore products is cyclical in nature and the Board of Directors continues to review its capital base in line with industry trends.
In prior years the Board approved investments in growth projects as part of its policy to support a strong capital base.
During the financial years 2015 and 2016, in recognition of the industry trend and to further support the Groups capital base, the Board slowed down investments in major growth projects.
Under consideration of increased iron ore prices and more positive industry trends, suspended investments in major growth projects are accelerating again in 2017.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
The Board continues to support maintaining a sound capital base balanced against these market constraints.
The Board maintains a dividend policy consistent with the Groups profile, reflecting the investment activities the Group has made supporting current and future production growth and the cash generated by existing operations, while maintaining a prudent level of dividend cover supported by an appropriate level of liquidity.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is subject to externally imposed capital requirements other than a bank covenant requirement to maintain consolidated equity of the Group of US$500,000 thousand including non-controlling interests and excluding the translation reserve.
Compliance is ensured by balancing dividend payments against the earnings of the Group.
For more information about the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings see Note 30.
FERREXPO PLC 137 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 31: Financial instruments continued Fair values and impairment testing Set out below are the carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial instruments that are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position: Carrying amount Fair value As at As at As at As at US$000 31.12.16 31.12.15 31.12.16 31.12.15 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 144,751 35,330 144,751 35,330 Restricted cash and deposits 9,308 9,308 Trade and other receivables 81,745 83,379 81,745 83,379 Other financial assets 9,700 5,766 9,700 5,766 Total financial assets 236,196 133,783 236,196 133,783 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables 28,807 27,566 28,807 27,566 Accrued liabilities 12,540 14,223 12,540 14,223 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 733,702 903,650 743,888 766,526 Total financial liabilities 775,049 945,439 785,235 808,315 Other financial assets The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and payables are approximately equal to their carrying amounts due to their short maturity.
The carrying amount and fair value of restricted cash and deposits is shown net of an allowance for cash and deposits held at Bank F&C, which are currently not available to the Group.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings The fair values of interest-bearing loans and borrowings are based on the discounted cash flows using market interest rates except for the fair value of the Eurobond issued, which is based on the market price quotation at the reporting date.
Available-for-sale investments All investments of the Group are listed on page 162 and relate to companies incorporated in Ukraine.
As at 31 December 2016, all investments are fully impaired.
As at the end of the comparative period ended 31 December 2015, the available-for-sale equity investment in PJSC Stakhanov Railcar Company was valued at US$9 thousand based on the quoted market price for its shares on the Ukrainian Stock Exchange.
During the financial year 2016, the investment was fully impaired.
Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position Except for the afore mentioned available-for-sale investments the Group did not have any financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Level 1 to Level 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 in these periods.
As at 9 June 2015, the Group disposed its 15.5% available-for-sale equity investment Level 3 in Ferrous Resources Limited for a total cash consideration of US$41,767 thousand, resulting in a gain in this amount realised in the comparative period ended 31 December 2015 after having been reclassified from other comprehensive income.
13 8 FERREXPO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Note 32: Share-based payments Accounting policy Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the award at the grant date using modelling techniques consistent with the mathematics underlying the Black-Scholes option pricing model extended to allow for the performance conditions.
The fair value is determined by reference to the quoted closing share price on the grant date.
The cost is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, except for market conditions, such as the relative Total Shareholder Return TSR.
Where the vesting of awards is subject to the satisfaction of certain market conditions, a vesting charge is recognised irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where awards terminate before the performance period is complete, any unamortised expense is recognised immediately.
At each reporting date, the cumulative expense of outstanding awards is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in employee benefit trust reserve in equity.
Long-term incentive plan LTIP The LTIP is a share-based scheme whereby certain senior management and executives receive rewards based on the relative TSR.
The LTIP is subject to a performance condition based on the TSR compared to a comparator group, which operate in a similar environment, measured over the vesting period.
Further description is provided in the Remuneration Report.
The cost of equity-settled awards is measured as described above together with an estimate of future social security contributions payable in respect of this value.

Note 35: Commitments, contingencies and legal disputes Accounting policy Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date, i. e. whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset, even if that right is not specified in an arrangement.
Group as a lessee Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance costs and the amortisation of the lease liability in order to achieve a constant interest rate on the remaining outstanding lease liability.
Finance costs are recognised in the income statement.
Leased assets are generally depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
If there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the leaseterm.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Management believes that the ultimate liability, if any, arising from such actions or complaints will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or the results of future operations of the Group.
Deposit Guarantee Fund and Liquidator of Bank F&C The Group recorded a full allowance for the cash balance held in Bank F&C BFC in September 2015 following which it was declared insolvent and put under temporary administration see also Note 29.
It is expected that the liquidation of the bank, which commenced in December 2015, will take several years and the level of potential recoverability of the remaining balance of restricted cash and deposits is still uncertain as at 31 December 2016.
As at 31 December 2016, the balance of restricted cash and deposits which is denominated in Ukrainian Hryvnia with a full allowance amounting to US$156,866 thousand 2015: US$168,575 thousand.
The Groups principal subsidiary, PJSC Ferrexpo Poltava Mining FPM, received a credit of US$9,984 thousand to its account with BFC following the introduction of the temporary administration on 18 September 2015.
FPM filed a claim against BFC under the management of the Administrator, as appointed by the Deposit Guarantee Fund DGF, on 30 October 2015 in the Kyiv City Commercial Court for the release of this amount in accordance with applicable legislation.
Following the hearing held on 4 December 2015, the Kyiv City Commercial Court ruled in favour of FPM.
This court ruling was subsequently appealed.
During the hearing on 25 May 2016, the initial decision in favour of FPM was upheld by the Kyiv Appellate Commercial Court and, on 10 June 2016, the decision was further appealed by BFC under the management of the Liquidator.
On 5 September 2016, the Highest Commercial Court of Ukraine cancelled both previous judgements of the lower court instances and returned the case to the Kyiv City Commercial Court.
FPM subsequently appealed the decision of the Highest Commercial Court of Ukraine to the Supreme Court of Ukraine.
On 17 October 2016, the highest court instance in Ukraine, the Supreme Court of Ukraine, rejected FPMs application to review the decision of the Highest Commercial Court ofUkraine.
On 31 January 2017, FPM brought the new application to the Supreme Court of Ukraine against the decision of the Highest Commercial Court of Ukraine.
On 6 February 2017, the Supreme Court of Ukraine refused to commence the review proceedings in respect of this decision.
As a consequence, the case was heard again by the Kyiv City Commercial Court on 14 March 2017 and this court instance dismissed FPMs claim in full.
Taking into account the latest court decision, the allowance recorded in respect of the restricted cash and deposits was increased by US$ 8,525 thousand at the average rate for December 2016, although FPM is going to appeal against this court decision.
Following commencement of the liquidation of BFC and in accordance with the applicable legislation, FPM, LLC Ferrexpo Yeristovo Mining GOK FYM and LLC Ferrexpo Belanovo Mining GOK FBM, collectively referred to as Ukrainian subsidiaries, submitted on 21 January 2016 their claims for UAH4,262 million.
This represents the total amount of cash held with the bank on the date of introduction of temporary administration after translating in accordance with applicable law all foreign currency amounts into local currency equivalents.
On 22 April 2016, the Liquidator of BFC issued certificates recognising UAH540 million of these claims.
These recognised claims had been included in the ninth rank on the basis that subsidiaries were considered as related parties.
The Ukrainian subsidiaries are currently engaged in court proceedings challenging both the under-recognition of claims and the ranking of the appropriate claims in the localcourts.
On 26 October 2016, FPM brought the lawsuit before the Kyiv Commercial Court against the Liquidator of BFC and the DGF challenging under-recognition and ranking of the claims in the liquidation of BFC.
On 26 December 2016, the court stayed the proceedings in the FPM litigation and ordered expert examination of the banking records and other documents in the case file by an accounting expert.
This order on stay of the proceedings has been appealed by PJSC Ukrainian International Airlines, which seeks to join the proceedings as an interested party.
On 1 February 2017, the Kyiv Appellate Commercial Court has dismissed the appeal of PJSC Ukrainian .
On 13 October 2016, FYM brought the lawsuit before the Kyiv Commercial Court against the Liquidator and the DGF challenging under-recognition and ranking of the claims in the liquidation of BFC.
On 17 October 2016, the Kyiv Commercial Court terminated the proceeding.
On 20 December 2016, the Kyiv Appellate Commercial Court returned the case for consideration to the local court.
The next hearing before the Kyiv Commercial Court has been scheduled for 15 March 2017.
On 26 October 2016, FBM brought the lawsuit before the Kyiv Commercial Court against the Liquidator and the DGF challenging underrecognition and ranking of the claims in the liquidation of BFC.
On 27 December 2016, the Kyiv Commercial Court rejected the claims of FBM in full.
FBM filed an appeal on 26 January 2017.
The hearing before the Kyiv Appellate Commercial Court has been scheduled for 1 March 2017.
An allowance has been recorded in the comparative period ended 31 December 2015 in respect of cash and deposits held at BFC at the time of temporary administration.
It is not expected that the successful determination of these cases results in either a full or partial release of the allowance for restricted cash and deposits at this point of time.

FERREXPO PLC 14 3 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Note 35: Commitments, contingencies and legal disputes continued Salvage of grounded vessel The Group was involved in arbitration proceedings in respect of the costs incurred for the salvage of a grounded vessel off the coast of Singapore carrying the Groups iron ore pellets to China.
Although the Groups customer was at risk in respect of the insurance cover for the pellets shipped, the Group received a claim from the salvage operator as the Group still had the title to the goods during the vessels period of salvage.
The final award from the Arbitrator was received in August 2016.
The decision was in favour of the opposing party, however, no payment was due from the Group as the liability was settled by the Groups insurance company under the existing insurance cover.
Share dispute The Group was involved in a share dispute which commenced in 2005 and has been disclosed in its various public documents since IPO in 2007.
On 20 October 2014, the Kyiv City Commercial Court dismissed the claim of the opposing party in full.
This judgment was confirmed by the Kyiv Appeal Commercial Court and the Higher Commercial Court of Ukraine on 28 January 2015 and 14 April 2015, respectively.
No further court proceedings have been initiated by the opposing party.
Tax and other regulatory compliance Ukrainian legislation and regulations regarding taxation and customs continue to evolve.
Legislation and regulations are not always clearly written and are subject to varying interpretations and inconsistent enforcement by local, regional and national authorities, and other governmental bodies.
Instances of inconsistent interpretations are not unusual.
The uncertainty of application and the evolution of Ukrainian tax laws, including those affecting cross-border transactions, create a risk of additional tax payments having to be made by the Group, which could have a material effect on the Groups financial position and results of operations.
This includes the transfer pricing law, which continues to evolve to increase the power of the tax authorities.
The Group does not believe that these risks are any more significant than those of similar enterprises in Ukraine.
Ukrainian VAT Recoverable VAT amounting to US$595 thousand outstanding at 31 December 2016 2015: US$4,549 thousand is currently in the process of being considered by the Ukrainian court system.
As the VAT is fully recoverable under the relevant Ukrainian legislation, the Group expects to receive positive court decisions for these cases and that the amount is recovered in full.
Consequently, no provision has been made for the VAT in dispute and associated fines and penalties.
Ukrainian withholding tax claims Following a tax audit at PJSC Ferrexpo Poltava Mining FPM claims were made by the Ukrainian tax authorities in relation to allegedly unpaid withholding tax totalling US$6,296 thousand UAH170 million and associated fines and penalties of US$1,555 thousand UAH42 million in respect of interest paid to a subsidiary of the Group in the United Kingdom in 2013 and 2014.
The management of the Group is of the opinion that the arguments of the tax office in respect of the current claim or any future withholding tax claims that may arise in respect of more recent periods are not well founded and applicable relevant tax treaties between the United Kingdom and Ukraine are applicable which would mitigate any claim.
After having taken legal advice, the management of the Group expects to successfully defend any claims made by the tax authorities in the Ukrainian courts.
Consequently, no provision has been made for the withholding tax and associated fines and penalties.

Control is obtained when the Group is exposed, or has the rights, to variable returns from its involvement with an entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity that gives the current ability to direct the relevant activities.
Control can be obtained through voting rights, but also through agreements, statutes, contracts, trust deeds or other schemes.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are shown separately in the Groups consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The share of the profit attributable to non-controlling interests is shown in the consolidated income statement and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

The Group does not have any other interests of 20% or more in undertakings that are not disclosed on page 162, except for the investment in the associate mentioned in Note 38.
Note 38: Investments in associates Accounting policy The Groups investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture.
Under the equity method, the investment in the associate is carried in the statement of financial position at cost plus any post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate.
Goodwill relating to an associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not amortised nor individually tested for impairment.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise any additional impairment loss with respect to the Groups investment in the associate.
The share of profit from an associate is shown on the face of the income statement.
This is the profit attributable to the Group and is therefore the profit after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associate.
