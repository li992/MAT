The 14.3m exceptional restructuring charge relates to asset write downs, redundancy costs and other reorganisation charges in markets experiencing significantly depressed trading conditions Singapore, Australia, Canada and South Africa.
This includes the write-down of surplus equipment to current market values where it is not being relocated to more active parts of the group.
Additional contingent consideration provided relates to the Bencor and Ellington Cross acquisitions.
The goodwill impairment in 2015 relates to Keller Canada.
The results for Keller Canada have been below those expected at the time of the acquisition, primarily due to a severe slowdown in investment in the Canadian oil sands following the very significant reduction in the oil price since the time of acquisition.
Further details are set out in note 13.
14.3m of exceptional credits relate to the contract dispute settled in 2014.
These credits are attributable to insurance proceeds received after an initial settlement with insurers, rental income less operating costs from the acquired processing and warehousing facility note 20 and the release of the portion of the contract dispute provision that was dependent on the valuation of the property.
Contingent consideration released relates to adjustments to estimated amounts payable for the Austral, Franki Africa and Geo-Foundations acquisitions.

Intangible assets arising on acquisition represent customer relationships, customer contracts at the date of acquisition, patents and trade names.
Keller Group plc 103 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 13 Intangible assets continued In 2016, for impairment testing purposes goodwill has been allocated to 18 separate cash-generating units CGUs.
Of these, the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the eight CGUs with the largest goodwill balances is significant in comparison to the total carrying amount of goodwill and comprises 86% of the total.
The relevant CGUs and the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to each are as set out below, together with the pre-tax discount rate and medium-term growth rate used in their value-in-use calculations: 1 2016 2015 Carrying Pre-tax Forecast Carrying Pre-tax Forecast value discount rate growth rate value discount rate growth rate Cash-generating unit Geographical segment m % % m % % Suncoast North America 35.0 12.0 2.0 29.1 12.7 2.0 Keller Canada North America 34.1 11.0 2.0 27.6 11.9 2.0 HJ Foundation North America 22.5 13.9 2.0 18.7 14.9 2.0 Keller Limited EMEA 12.1 10.7 2.0 12.1 11.9 2.0 ASEAN Heavy Foundations APAC 12.0 12.6 2.0 10.3 13.0 2.0 Hayward Baker North America 11.6 12.4 2.0 9.7 13.4 2.0 Waterway APAC 8.2 13.6 2.0 6.9 14.6 1.0 Austral APAC 7.9 13.6 2.0 6.7 14.6 2.0 Other Various 23.1 12.9 166.5 134.0 1 Re-presented to align 2015s carrying amount of goodwill to 2016s CGU allocation as a result of changes in management structure.
The goodwill in the previous CGUs of Resource Piling and Ansah have been aggregated along with the Malaysia heavy foundations business to form the ASEAN Heavy Foundations CGU.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill allocated to each CGU has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation.
The calculations all use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by management covering a three-year period.
The groups businesses operate in cyclical markets, some of which are expected to continue to face uncertain conditions over the next couple of years.
The most important factors in the value-in-use calculations, however, are the forecast revenues and operating margins during the forecast period and the discount rates applied to future cash flows.
The key assumptions underlying the cash flow forecasts are therefore the revenue and operating margins assumed throughout the forecast period.
The discount rates used in the value-in-use calculations are based on the weighted average cost of capital of companies comparable to the relevant CGUs, adjusted as necessary to reflect the risk associated with the asset being tested.
Management considers all the forecast revenues, margins and profits to be reasonably achievable given recent performance and the historic trading results of the relevant CGUs.
Cash flows beyond 2019 have been extrapolated using a steady growth rate of 2%, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which the relevant CGUs operate.
Management believes that, with the exception of Keller Canada, any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amounts of the CGUs identified above are based would not cause any of their carrying amounts to exceed their recoverable amounts.
In 2015, the carrying value of the Keller Canada goodwill was impaired by 31.2m C$60.9m due to the results of Keller Canada being below those expected at the time of the acquisition, primarily due to a severe slowdown in investment in the Canadian oil sands following the very significant reduction in the oil price since the time of acquisition.
Keller Canada continues to operate in a very difficult market.
The assumptions underlying the forecasts used in the value-in-use calculation at 31 December 2016 are for a gradual recovery in the Canadian market in the medium term, albeit to a level lower than that expected at the time of acquisition, such that the compound annual revenue growth rate is 5% over the period under review and operating margins gradually recover to 9%.
Based on the value in use calculation, the recoverable amount of Keller Canada exceeds the carrying amount by 23.7m C$39.4m.
In order for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying amount, forecast revenue growth in each year, at the assumed operating margins, would have to decrease by 5.8%, which would result in a 2.3% compound annual growth rate over the period from 2017 to 2021.
Alternatively, assumed operating margins in each year would have to decrease by 1.7% or the discount rate would have to increase by 2.2%.

As set out in the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts, the groups final liability with regards to the historic contract dispute involving the property is in part dependent on the value of the property.
In order to maximise this value, the group decided to acquire the property with a view to marketing it to third parties.
In accordance with IFRS5, the property is being held at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
At 30 June 2016, the fair value of the property was 48m, based on an external valuation.
The property was impaired by 14m at 30 June 2016, however the group previously held a 14m provision for the diminution in value of the property as part of the overall contract dispute provision, and therefore no additional impairment charge was recognised.
At 31December 2016, the fair value of the property based on an external valuation was 54m.
The 6m reversal of impairment has been recognised as exceptional other operating income note 7.
Rental income less operating costs for the period has been included within exceptional other operating income note 7.

24 Financial instruments Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of the groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates.
The group does not trade in financial instruments nor does it engage in speculative derivative transactions.
Currency risk The group faces currency risk principally on its net assets, most of which are in currencies other than sterling.
The group aims to reduce theimpact that retranslation of these net assets might have on the consolidated balance sheet, by matching the currency of its borrowings, where possible, with the currency of its assets.
The majority of the groups borrowings are held in sterling, US dollars, Canadian dollars, euros, Australian dollars, Singapore dollars and South African rand, in order to provide a hedge against these currency net assets.
The group manages its currency flows to minimise currency transaction exchange risk.
Forward contracts and other derivative financial instruments are used to hedge significant individual transactions.
The majority of such currency flows within the group relate to repatriation of profits, intra-group loan repayments and any foreign currency cash flows associated with acquisitions.
The groups foreign exchange cover is executed primarily in the UK.
At 31 December 2016, the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding was 0.2m, included in current assets 2015: 0.4m, included in current liabilities.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is managed by mixing fixed and floating rate borrowings depending upon the purpose and term of the financing.
Keller Group plc 107 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 24 Financial instruments continued Credit risk The groups principal financial assets are trade and other receivables, bank and cash balances and a limited number of investments and derivatives held to hedge certain of the groups liabilities.
These represent the groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The group has stringent procedures to manage counterparty risk and the assessment of customer credit risk is embedded in the contract tendering processes.
Customer credit risk is mitigated by the groups relatively small average contract size, its diversity, both geographically and in terms of end markets, and by taking out credit insurance in many of the countries in which the group operates.
No individual customer represented more than 5% of revenue in 2016.
The counterparty risk on bank and cash balances is managed by limiting the aggregate amount of exposure to any one institution by reference to their credit rating and by regular review of these ratings.
The ageing oftrade receivables that were past due but not impaired is shown in note 17.
Liquidity risk and capital management The groups capital structure is kept under constant review, taking account of the need for, availability and cost of various sources offinance.
The capital structure of the group consists of net debt, as shown on page 109, and equity attributable to equity holders oftheparent as shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
The group maintains a balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost-effective financing structure with all main borrowings being from committed facilities.
The groups policy continues to be to ensurethat its capital structure is appropriate to support this balance and the groups operations.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The groups debt and committed facilities mainly comprise a $40m private placement repayable in 2018, a $50m private placement repayable in 2021, a $75m private placement repayable in 2024, a $45m revolving credit facility expiring in 2019, a 48m term facility expiring in May 2017 and a 250m syndicated revolving credit facility expiring in 2019.
These facilities are subject to certain covenants linked to the groups financing structure, specifically regarding the ratios of debt and interest to profit.
The group has complied with these covenants throughout the period.
At the year end, the group also had other committed and uncommitted borrowing facilities totalling 69.2m 2015: 51.4m to support local requirements.
Private placements In August 2012, $40m was raised through a private placement with US institutions.
The proceeds of the issue of $40m 5.0% notes due2018 were used to repay existing debt.
In October and December 2014, a further $50m and $75m respectively were raised through a private placement with US institutions.
The proceeds of the issue of $50m 3.81% Series A notes due 2021 and $75m 4.17% Series B notes due 2024 were used to refinance maturing private placements.
The US private placement loans are accounted for on an amortised cost basis, adjusted for the impact of hedge accounting as described below, and retranslated at the spot exchange rate at each period end.
The carrying value of the private placement liabilities at 31December 2016 was 136.3m 2015: 114.7m.
Hedging In June 2006, $185m of floating rate intra-group debt was swapped into sterling floating rates by means of dollar sterling cross-currency interest rate swaps the 2006 swaps.
The 2006 swaps, which matured June 2016, had the same maturity as the intra-group debt and were designated as cash flow hedges of the Companys exposure to the variability of cash flows on the intra-group debt resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the 2006 swaps, a loss of 3.8m 2015: 5.6m, has been taken to the hedging reserve and fully recycled through the income statement during the year.
28.0m was paid to settle the 2006 swap liability on its maturity in June 2016.
The 2012 $40m fixed rate private placement liabilities were swapped into sterling by means of dollar sterling cross-currency fixed interest rate swaps.
Also, on the same date, 25.5m of sterling was swapped into euros by means of sterling euro cross-currency fixed interest rate swaps.
These interest rate swaps the 2012 swaps have the same maturity as the private placement liability.
The dollar sterling swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the Companys exposure to the variability of cash flows on the private placement resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates and the sterling euro swaps have been designated as net investment hedges of the groups eurodenominated net assets.
The fair value of the 2012 swaps at 31 December 2016 represented an asset of 6.9m 2015: 2.8m included in other non-current assets and a liability of 2.5m 2015: nil included in other non-current liabilities.
The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the dollar sterling swaps, a gain of 5.5m 2015: 1.5m, has been taken to the hedging reserve and fully recycled through the income statement during the year.
The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the sterling euro swaps, a loss of 3.8m 2015: gain of 1.7m, has been taken to the translation reserve through other comprehensive income along with the foreign exchange gains and losses arising on retranslation of the euro-denominated assets they hedge.
The 2014 $50m and $75m fixed rate private placement liabilities were swapped into floating rate by means of US dollar interest rate swaps the 2014 swaps.
The 2014 swaps have the same maturity as the private placement liabilities and have been designated as fair valuehedges of the groups exposure to changes in the fair value of the US private placement loans and related interest cash flows due tochanges in US dollar interest rates.
108 Keller Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements The fair value of the 2014 swaps at 31 December 2016 represented an asset of 2.5m 2015: 3.5m which is included in other non-current assets.
The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the 2014 swaps, a loss of 1.2m 2015: gain of 0.8m, has been taken to the income statement along with equal and opposite movement in fair value of the corresponding hedged items.
All hedges are tested for effectiveness every six months using the cumulative dollar offset method.
All hedging relationships remained effective during the year.
The ineffective portion of the movement in the fair value of the hedging instruments was a gain of 0.2m 2015:0.2m.

Keller Group plc 109 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 24 Financial instruments continued The group had unutilised committed banking facilities of 108.3m at 31 December 2016 2015: 127.6m.
This mainly comprised the unutilised portion of the groups 250m facility which expires on 4 September 2019.
In addition, the group had unutilised uncommitted borrowing facilities totalling 40.7m at 31 December 2016 2015: 25.9m.
All of these borrowing facilities are unsecured.
Future obligations under finance leases totalled 3.2m 2015: 3.5m, including interest of 0.3m 2015: 0.3m.
Fair values The fair values of the groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values.
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Derivatives The fair value of interest rate and cross-currency swaps is calculated based on expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
In 2016 and in 2015, the valuation methods of all of the groups derivative financial instruments carried at fair value are categorised as Level 2.
Level 2 is defined as inputs, other than quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Contingent consideration Fair value is calculated based on the amounts expected to be paid, determined by reference to forecasts of future performance of the acquired businesses discounted using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date and the probability of contingent events and targets being achieved.
In 2016 and in 2015, the valuation methods of all of the groups contingent consideration carried at fair value are categorised as Level 3.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the groups contingent consideration are forecast revenue growth rates 2016: 2%-31%, forecast EBITDA margins 2016: 2%-15% and pre-tax discount rates 2016: 15%-32%.
The following table shows a reconciliation from the opening to closing balances for Level 3 fair values: Contingent consideration m At 1 January 2016 9.6 Provision released note 7 4.2 Additional amounts provided note 7 3.9 Paid during the year 1.0 Assumed within business combinations note 4 0.6 Unwind of discounted contingent consideration note 7 0.3 1 Exchange differences 2.0 At 31 December 2016 11.2 1 Included in other comprehensive income.
The fair value measurement of the contingent consideration could be affected if the forecast revenue growth rates or forecast EBITDA margins are different to those stated above.
A higher forecast revenue growth rate or higher EBITDA margin may increase the value of the contingent consideration payable.
Trade and other payables and receivables and construction work in progress For payables and receivables with a remaining life of one year or less, the carrying amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other payables and receivables are discounted using market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate and currency profile The profile of the groups financial assets and financial liabilities after taking account of swaps was as follows: 2016 1 Sterling USD Euro CAD Other Total Weighted average fixed debt interest rate 4.3% 7.5% 16.1% n a Weighted average fixed debt period years 2.3 1.1 1.2 n a m m m m m m Fixed rate financial liabilities 36.7 0.1 1.3 38.1 Floating rate financial liabilities 153.0 103.8 24.1 42.3 28.7 351.9 Financial assets 6.4 30.3 8.4 10.0 29.3 84.4 Net debt 146.6 73.5 52.4 32.4 0.7 305.6 110 Keller Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2015 1 Sterling USD Euro CAD Other Total Weighted average fixed debt interest rate 3.9% 12.6% n a Weighted average fixed debt period years 3.3 1.1 n a m m m m m m Fixed rate financial liabilities 29.8 1.1 30.9 Floating rate financial liabilities 87.7 23.7 67.7 36.1 215.2 Financial assets 2.8 11.4 10.4 2.2 36.3 63.1 Net debt 2.8 76.3 43.1 66.6 0.2 183.0 1 Included within other floating rate financial liabilities are AUD revolver loans of 6.4m 2015: 19.5m, ZAR revolver loans of 5.9m 2015: 3.4m and SGD revolver loans of 12.1m 2015: 9.9m.

Sensitivity analysis At 31 December 2016, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the groups profit before taxation by approximately 2.8m.
The estimated impact of a one percentage point decrease in interest rates is to increase the groups profit before taxation by approximately 2.8m.
The impact of interest rate swaps has been included in this calculation.
It is estimated that a general increase of 10 percentage points in the value of sterling against other principal foreign currencies would have decreased the groups profit before taxation and non-underlying items by approximately 7.2m for the year ended 31 December 2016, with the estimated impact of a 10 percentage points decrease in the value of sterling being an increase of 8.9m in the groups profit before taxation and non-underlying items.
This sensitivity relates to the impact of retranslation of foreign earnings only.
The impact on the groups earnings of currency transaction exchange risk is not significant.
These sensitivities assume all other factors remain constant.

Some of these claims involve or may involve litigation and, in a few instances, the total amounts claimed against the group may be significant in relation to the size of the related contract.
However, the amounts agreed, if any, are generally less than the total amount claimed, in many cases significantly so, and are normally covered by the groups insurance arrangements.
The group has entered into bonds in the normal course of business relating to contract tenders, advance payments, contract performance, the release of retentions and the groups insurance arrangements.
The estimated financial effect of these bonds, apart from the fees paid, is nil 2015: nil.

The average share price during the year was 853.9p.
Under IFRS2, the fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of share options granted is measured based on a stochastic model.
The contractual life of the option is used as an input into this model, with expectations of early exercise being incorporated into the model.
The inputs into the stochastic model are as follows: 2016 2015 Weighted average share price 815p 1,028p Weighted average exercise price 0.0p 0.0p Expected volatility 31.0% 31.0% Expected life 3 years 3 years Risk free rate 0.45% 0.87% Expected dividend yield 3.1% 2.40% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the groups share price over the previous three years, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
The group recognised total expenses included in operating costs of 1.0m 2015: 1.8m related to equity-settled, share-based payment transactions.
The weighted average fair value of options granted in the year was 599.0p 2015: 748.1p.

The Scheme can invest in a wide range of asset classes including equities, bonds, cash, property, alternatives including private equity, commodities, hedge funds, infrastructure, currency, high yield debt and derivatives and annuity policies.
Any investment in derivative instruments is only made to contribute to a reduction in the overall level of risk in the portfolio or for the purposes of efficient portfolio management.
