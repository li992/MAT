27.2 Indirect taxation Group companies may be subject to VAT on transactions which have been treated as exempt supplies of gambling, or on supplies which have been exported outside the scope of VAT where legislation provides that the services are received or used and enjoyed in the country where the service provider is located.
Where group companies have treated supplies of gambling as exempt based on exemptions available to comparable supplies in the place where the customer is located, the right to exemption may be restricted if the supplies do not have similar characteristics or meet the same needs as other exempt gambling from the customers point of view.
Where group companies have determined the taxable amount for supplies of gambling to be the amount of stakes received less amounts that have to be returned to players, the right to a deduction for amounts returned to players may be restricted to the extent that the obligation to make a payment is not enforceable in the place where the customer is located.
Revenues earned from customers located in any particular jurisdiction may give rise to further taxes in that jurisdiction.
If such taxes are levied, either on the basis of current law or the current practice of any tax authority, or by reason of a change in the law or practice, then this may have a material adverse effect on the amount of tax payable by the Group or on its financial position.
Where it is considered probable that a previously identied contingent liability will give rise to an actual outow of funds, then a provision is made in respect of the relevant jurisdiction and period impacted.
Where the likelihood of a liability arising is considered remote, or the possible contingency is not material to the financial position of the Group, the contingency is not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
