STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT RISK REVIEW AND CAPITAL REVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 31.
INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS, JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES Accounting policy Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities, including structured entities, which the Group controls.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The assessment of power is based on the Groups practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity unilaterally forthe Groups own benefit and is subject to reassessment if and when one or more of the elements of control change.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group effectively obtains control.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases, and where any interest in the subsidiary remains, this is re-measured to its fair value and the change in carrying amount is recognised in the incomestatement.
Associates and joint arrangements Joint arrangements are where two or more parties either have rights to the assets, and obligations ofthe joint arrangement joint operations, or have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement joint venture.
The Group evaluates the contractual terms of joint arrangements to determine whether a joint arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture.
As at 31 December 2016, the Group did not have any contractual interest in joint operations.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
TheGroups investment in associates and joint ventures includes goodwill identified on acquisition net of any accumulated impairment loss.
The Groups share of its associates and joint ventures post acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share ofpost-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in reserves.
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate or a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
Unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates and joint ventures.
At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether there is any objective evidence of impairment in the investment in associates and joint ventures.
Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value ofthe Groups investment in an associate or joint venture below its cost, among other factors.
Significant accounting estimates and judgements Impairment testing of investments in associates and joint arrangements is based on judgements including the basis of assumptions and forecasts used for estimating the expected cash flows from the investments and in the calculations of the present values of those cash flows.
The estimation of future cash flows and the level to which they are discounted is inherently uncertain and requires significant judgement.
Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost ofan acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, together with the fair value of any contingent consideration payable.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill see note 17 for details on goodwill recognised by the Group.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Where the fair values of the identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities acquired have been determined provisionally, or where contingent ordeferred consideration is payable, adjustments arising from their subsequent finalisation are not reflected in the income statement if i they arise within 12 months of the acquisition date or relate to acquisitions completed before 1 January 2014 and ii the adjustments arise from better information about conditions existing at the acquisition date measurement period adjustments.
Such adjustments are applied as at the date of acquisition and, if applicable, prior year amounts are restated.
All changes that are not measurement period adjustments are reported in income other than changes in contingent consideration not classified as financial instruments, which are accounted for in accordance with the appropriate accounting policy, and changes in contingent consideration classified as equity, which is not re-measured.
Changes in ownership interest in a subsidiary, which do not result in a loss of control, are treated as transactions between equity holders and are reported in equity.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is re-measured at the acquisition date fair value with the resulting gain or loss recognised in the income statement.
In the Companys financial statements, investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are held at cost less impairment and dividends from pre-acquisition profits received prior to 1 January 2009, if any.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated in the Group accounts.

This country contributes 3.9 per cent of the Groups operating profit and 0.4 per cent of the Groups assets.
Whilst the Groups subsidiaries are subject to local statutory capital and liquidity requirements in relation to foreign exchange remittance, these restrictions arise in the normal course of business and do not significantly restrict the Groups ability to access or use assets and settle liabilities of the Group.
The Group does not have significant restrictions on its ability to access or use its assets and settle its liabilities other than those resulting from theregulatory framework within which the banking subsidiaries operate.
These frameworks require banking operations to keep certain levels ofregulatory capital, liquid assets, exposure limits and comply with other required ratios.
These restrictions are summarised as follows: Regulatory and liquidity requirements: The Groups subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital, leverage ratios, liquidity andexposure ratios which therefore restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to distribute cash or other assets to the parent company.
The subsidiaries are also required to maintain balances with central banks and other regulatory authorities in the countries in which they operate.
At 31 December 2016, the total cash and balances with central bank was $71 billion 2015: $65 billion of which $9 billion 2015: $9 billion is restricted.
See liquid asset disclosure on page 176.

INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS, JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES continued The following table sets out the summarised financial statements of Permata Tbk prior to the Groups share of joint ventures being applied: 2016 2015 $million $million Current assets 6,484 8,918 Non-current assets 5,697 4,183 Current liabilities 9,896 10,739 Non-current liabilities 963 1,107 Net assets 1,322 1,255 Operating income 608 623 Of which: Interest income 1,083 1,205 Interest expense 641 742 Expenses 329 573 Impairment 923 25 Operating profit 644 25 Taxation 161 5 Loss profit after tax 483 20 The above amounts of assets and liabilities include the following: Cash and cash equivalents 1,964 1,814 Other comprehensive loss for the year 4 Total comprehensive loss income for the year 487 20 Dividends received from the joint venture during the year 6 In December 2016 Permata established a portfolio of non-performing loans that are beyond its risk appetite which are to be liquidated.
This resulted in an incremental impairment of $140 million, representing the difference between the carrying amount of the liquidation portfolio on ahold to collect basis and the amount expected to be realised upon liquidation.
This is consistent with the Groups restructuring actions.
Accordingly, the Group has recorded its $62 million share of this incremental impairment as restructuring and it has been normalised from the underlying results of the Group.
Non-current assets are primarily loans to customers and current liabilities are primarily customer deposits based on contractual maturities.
