FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 CONSOLIDATED 121 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Accounting policies THE COMPANY Rolls-Royce Holdings plc the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2016 consist of the consolidation of the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and include the Groups interest in jointly controlled and associated entities.
BASIS OF PREPARATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE In accordance with European Union EU regulations, these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, as adopted for use in the EU effective at 31 December 2016 Adopted IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its individual company financial statements under FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
They are set out on pages 167 to 169 and the accounting policies in respect of Company financial statements are set out on page 168.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except where Adopted IFRS requires the revaluation of financial instruments to fair value and certain other assets and liabilities on an alternative basis most significantly post-retirement scheme obligations are valued on the basis required by IAS 19 Employee Benefits and on a going concern basis as described on page 53.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling which is the Companys functional currency.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
KEY AREAS OF JUDGEMENT Introduction The Group generates a significant portion of its revenues and profit on aftermarket arrangements arising from the installed original equipment OE fleet.
As a consequence, the Group will often agree contractual prices for OE deliveries that take into account the anticipated aftermarket arrangements.
Accounting policies reflect this aspect of the business model, in particular thepolicies for the recognition of contractual aftermarket rights and the linkage of OE and actual aftermarket arrangements.
When a civil large engine is sold, the economic benefits received usually far exceed the cash receivable under the contract, due to the rightsto valuable aftermarket spare parts business.
However, because the value of this right cannot be estimated with enough precision, accounting standards require that the revenue recognised in the accounts on sale of the engine is restricted to a total amount that results in a break even position.
The amount of the revenue recognised in excess of cash receivable is recognised as an intangible asset, which is called a contractual aftermarket right CAR.
There is only one circumstance where accounting standards require the recognition of more of the value of the aftermarket rights whenanengine is sold.
This occurs where a long-term aftermarket contract generally a TotalCare agreement TCA and an engine salecontract have been negotiated together.
In this circumstance, the part of the aftermarket rights covered by the TCA can be valued much more precisely and is recognised at the time of the engine sale through accounting for the engine sale and TCA as a single contract.
Nevertheless, the accounting profit recognised is still less than the economic benefits on the sale as there will be other valuable aftermarket rights for instance for the period beyond the TCA term or for the sale of parts which are outside the scope of the TCA whichcannot be recognised.
The Group enters into arrangements with long-term suppliers to share the risks and rewards of major programmes risk and revenue sharing arrangements RRSAs.
The accounting policy for these arrangements has been chosen, consistent with Adopted IFRS, to reflect their commercial effect.
The key judgements in determining these accounting policies are described below.
Contractual aftermarket rights On delivery of Civil Aerospace engines, the Group has contractual rights to supply aftermarket parts to the customers and its intellectual rights, warranty arrangements and, where relevant, statutory airworthiness or other regulatory requirements provide reasonable control over this supply.
The Directors consider that these rights meet the definition of an intangible asset in IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
However, the Directors do not consider that it is possible to determine a reliable fair value for this intangible asset.
Accordingly, an intangible asset CAR is only recognised on the occasions where the contractual price of the engine is below the cost of manufacture and then only to the extent of this deficit, as this amount is reliably measurable.
An equal amount of revenue is recognised at the same point.
Where a long-term aftermarket contract is linked to the OE contract see page 122, the contractual price of the engine including amounts allocated from the aftermarket contract is above its cost of manufacture: consequently no CAR is recognised.
122 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Measure of performance on long-term aftermarket contracts A large proportion of the Groups activities relate to long-term aftermarket contracts, in particular TotalCare and similar arrangements in Civil Aerospace.
Under these contracts, the Groups primary obligation is to maintain customers equipment in an operational condition and it achieves this by undertaking various activities, such as engine monitoring, line maintenance and repair and overhaul, over the period of the contract.
In general, the Directors consider that the stage of performance of the contract should be by reference to the obligation to maintain an operational fleet and that this is best measured by the operation of the fleet.
Accordingly, stage of performance is measured by reference to flying hours of each fleet under contract.
Linkage of OE and long-term aftermarket contracts Where the key terms of a long-term aftermarket contract are substantively agreed eg.
in a term sheet at the same time as an OE contract with the operator, the Directors consider these to be linked for accounting purposes and they are treated as a single contract, as this best reflects the overall commercial effect.
Where the OE contract is not with the operator, eg.
where it is with an OE manufacturer or a lessor, the contracts are not linked as they were not negotiated on a unified basis.
Sales of spare engines to joint ventures Whether the sales price reflects fair value when the Group sells spare engines to a joint venture company.
Risk and revenue sharing arrangements RRSAs with key suppliers workshare partners are a feature of our Civil Aerospace business.
Under these contractual arrangements, the key commercial objectives are that: i during the development phase the workshare partner shares in the risks of developing an engine by performing its own development work, providing development parts and paying a non-refundable cash entry fee: and ii during the production phase it supplies components in return for a share of the programme revenues as a life of type supplier ie.
as long as the engine remains in service.
The share of development costs borne by the workshare partner and of the revenues it receives reflect the partners proportionate cost of providing its production parts compared to the overall manufacturing cost of the engine.
The share is based on a jointly-agreed forecast at the commencement of the arrangement.
These arrangements are complex and have features that could be indicative of: a collaboration agreement, including sharing of risk and cost in a development programme: a long-term supply agreement: sharing of intellectual property: or a combination of these.
In summary, and as described below, the Directors view is that the development and production phases of the contract should be considered separately in accounting for the RRSA, which results in the entry fee being matched against the non-recurring costs incurred by the Group.
Having considered the features above, the Directors consider that there is no directly applicable IFRS to determine an accounting policy for the recognition of entry fees of this nature in the income statement.
Consequently, in developing an accounting treatment for such entry fees that best reflects the commercial objectives of the contractual arrangement, the Directors have analysed these features in the context of relevant accounting pronouncements including those of other standard setters where these do not conflict with IFRS and have weighed the importance of each feature in faithfully representing the overall commercial effect.
The most important considerations that need to be balanced are: the transfer of development risk: the workshare partner receiving little standalone value from the payment of the entry fee: and the overall effect being collaboration between the parties which falls short of being a joint venture as the Group controls the programme.
Also important in the analysis is the fact that, whilst the Group and the workshare partner share risks and rewards through the life of the contract, these risks and rewards are very different during the development and production phases.
In this context, the entry fee might be considered to represent: an amount paid as an equalisation of development costs: a payment to secure a long-term supply arrangement: a purchase of intellectual property: or some combination thereof.
The accounting under these different scenarios could include: recognition of the entry fee to match the associated costs in the income statement: being spread over the life of the programme as a reduction in the cost of supply during production: or being spread over the time period of the access to the intellectual property by the workshare partner.
The Directors consider that the most important features of the arrangement are the risk sharing and that the entry fee represents a contribution to the development costs that the Group incurs in excess of its proportionate programme share.
The key judgements taken in reaching this view are: the entry fee is determined by the parties on that basis and the contract specifies that, in the event that a derivative engine is to be developed, additional entry fees will also be calculated on this basis: the workshare partners describe the entry fee in this way: although the workshare partner receives little stand-alone value from paying the entry fee, the entry fee together with its own development activities represent its aggregate investment in the collaboration: the amount of the entry fee does not include any amount in excess of that necessary to equalise forecast development costs: the Group is not on risk for the full development costs it incurs but for that amount less the entry fees received.
The resulting accounting policy described on page 125 represents the commercial effect of the contractual arrangements in that the Group recognises only those development costs to which it is exposed and thus reflects the significant transfer of development risk to the workshare partner and the costs of supply of parts during the production phase is measured at the workshare partners share of programme revenues which we consider to be a commercial fair value.
The Directors do not consider that accounting which would result in entry fees only being recognised in the production phase would appropriately reflect the sharing of development risk.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that the policy adopted best reflects the commercial objectives of the arrangements, the nature of the relationship with the workshare partner and is in accordance with Adopted IFRS.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 CONSOLIDATED 123 1 Accounting policies continued As described in the 2013 Annual Report, an alternative view is that the RRSA contract cannot be divided into separate development and production phases, as the fees and development components received by the Group during the development phase are exchanged for the obligation to pay the supplier a predetermined share of any sales receipts during the production phase.
On this basis, the entry fees received would be deferred in their entirety and recognised over the period of production.
The size of the difference between the two approaches is monitored and is not currently expected to become material in the foreseeable future.
The impact of the different approaches on profit before tax and net assets, which is not considered to be material, is as follows: 2016 2015 Reported Underlying profit Reported Underlying profit profit before tax before tax Net assets profit before tax before tax Net assets m m m m m m Adopted policy 4,636 813 1,864 160 1,432 5,016 Difference 2 2 442 28 28 435 1 Alternative policy 4,638 811 1,422 132 1,404 4,581 1 If the alternative policy were adopted, the difference would be included in profit before financing, which would change from 41m as reported to 39m 2015: 1,501m to 1,473m.
Internally-generated development costs IAS 38 requires that internally-generated development costs should only be recognised if strict criteria are met, in particular relating to technical feasibility and generation of future economic benefits.
The Directors consider that, due to the complex nature of new equipment programmes, these criteria are not met until relatively late in the programme Civil Aerospace programmes represent around half of development costs recognised: for these, the criteria are generally satisfied around the time of the initial engine certification.
Customer financing contingent liabilities The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of financing support provided to customers.
In order to assess whether a provision should berecognised, judgement as to the likelihood of these crystallising is required.
This judgement is based on an assessment on the knowledge of the customers fleet plans, the underlying value of the security provided and, where appropriate, the customers creditworthiness.
KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY In applying the accounting policies, estimates are made in many areas: the actual outcome may differ from that calculated.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are set out below.
The estimation of the relevant assets and liabilities involves the combination ofanumber of assumptions.
Sensitivities are disclosed in the relevant notes where this is appropriate and practicable.
Forecasts and discount rates The carrying values of a number of items on the balance sheet are dependent on the estimates of future cash flows arising from the Groups operations, in particular: The assessment of whether the goodwill carrying value at 31 December 2016: 1,537m, 31 December 2015:1,503m arising on the consolidation of acquired businesses is impaired is dependent of the present value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the business.
The assessment as to whether there are any indications of impairment of development, participation, certification, customer relationships andcontractual aftermarket rights recognised as intangible assets carrying values at 31 December 2016: 2,846m, 31 December 2015: 2,533m is dependent on estimates of cash flows generated by the relevant assets and the discount rate used to calculate a present value.
These estimates include the performance of long-term contractual arrangements as described below, as well as estimates for future market share, pricing and unit cost for uncontracted business.
The risk of impairment is generally higher for newer programmes and for customer specific intangible assets CARs for launch customers and typically reduces as programmes become more established.
Assessment of long-term contractual arrangements The Group has long-term contracts that fall into different accounting periods and which can extend over significant periods the most significant of these are long-term service arrangements in the Civil Aerospace business.
The estimated revenues and costs are inherently imprecise and significant estimates are required to assess: engine flying hours, time on wing and other operating parameters: the pattern of future maintenance activity and the costs to be incurred: life-cycle cost improvements over the term of the contracts and escalation of revenues and costs.
The estimates take account of the inherent uncertainties and the risk of non-recovery of any resulting contract balances.
In addition many of the revenues and costs are denominated in currencies other than that of the relevant Group undertaking.
These are translated at an estimated long-term exchange rate, based on historical trends.
In 2016, the US dollar long-term exchange rate was reduced by five cents, resulting in a one-off benefit to profit before tax of 35m.
124 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Post-retirement benefits The Groups defined benefit pension schemes and similar arrangements are assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19.
The accounting valuation, which is based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice, resulted in a net deficit of 29m before deferred taxation being recognised on the balance sheet at 31 December 2016 31 December 2015: net deficit 77m.
The size of the net surplus deficit is sensitive to the market value of the assets held by the schemes and to actuarial assumptions, which include price inflation, pension and salary increases, the discount rate used in assessing actuarial liabilities, mortality and other demographic assumptions and the levels of contributions.
Further details are included in note 19.
Provisions As described in the accounting policy on page 128, the Group measures provisions carrying value at 31 December 2016: 759m, 31December 2015: 640m at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
These estimates take account of information available and different possible outcomes.
Taxation The tax payable on profits is determined based on tax laws and regulations that apply in each of the numerous jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Where the precise impact of these laws and regulations is unclear, or uncertain, then reasonable estimates may be used todetermine the tax charge included in the financial statements.
The main area of uncertainty is in relation to cross-border transactions, entered into in the normal course of business, as the amount of income or profit taxable in each country involved can be subjective and therefore open to interpretation by the relevant tax authorities.
This can result in disputes and possibly litigation.
Tax provisions require management to make judgements and estimates of exposures in relation to tax audit issues and other areas of uncertainty.
Contingent liabilities, including in respect of any tax disputes or litigation, are covered in note 23 contingent liabilities.
Allprovisions are in current liabilities.
Any liability relating to interest or penalties on tax liabilities is included in the tax charge.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised, based on managements assumptions relating to the amounts and timing of future taxable profits.
Further details on the Groups tax position can be found on page 184.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Groups significant accounting policies are set out below.
These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and by all Group entities.
Basis of consolidation The Group consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings together with the Groups share of the results of joint arrangements and associates made up to 31 December.
In line with common practice in Germany, a small number of immaterial subsidiaries of Rolls-Royce Power Systems are not consolidated and are carried at cost in other investments.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has power over an entity, exposure to variable returns from its involvement with an entity and the ability to use its power over an entity so as to affect the Companys returns.
A joint arrangement is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement.
Joint arrangements may be either joint ventures or joint operations.
An associate is an entity, being neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement, in which the Group holds a long-term interest and where the Group has a significant influence.
The results of joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Joint operations are accounted for using proportionate accounting.
During the year, the Group has reassessed the categorisation of joint arrangements.
As a result of this review, certain entities, previously classified as joint ventures, have been reclassified as joint operations from 1 January 2016.
This reclassification does not affect profit before tax or net assets, but the Groups share of the individual income statement and balance sheet categories are included on a proportional basis, rather than as a single figure.
The adjustment to the opening balance was to reclassify 57m of investments in joint ventures to: property, plant and equipment 41m, inventory 19m, receivables 18m, cash 5m, payables 17m and borrowings 9m.
Prior year figures have not been restated.
Any subsidiary undertakings, joint arrangements or associates sold or acquired during the year are included up to, or from, the date ofchange of control.
Transactions with non-controlling interests are recorded directly in equity.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Adjustments are made to eliminate the profitor loss arising on transactions with joint arrangements and associates to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 CONSOLIDATED 125 1 Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenues comprise sales to outside customers after discounts, excluding value added taxes.
Sales of products both OE and spare parts are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods aretransferred to the customer, the sales price agreed and the receipt of payment can be assured this is generally on delivery.
On occasion, theGroup may participate in the financing of OE, most commonly by the provision of guarantees as described in note 18.
In such circumstances, the contingent obligations arising under these arrangements are taken into account in assessing when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer.
As described on page 121, a sale of OE at a contractual price below its cost of manufacture isconsidered to give rise to revenue to the extent that an intangible asset contractual aftermarket right is recognised at the same time.
Sales of services are recognised by reference to the stage of completion based on services performed to date.
As described on page 122, the assessment of the stage of completion is dependent on the nature of the contract, but will generally be based on: flying hours or equivalent for long-term aftermarket arrangements where the service is provided on a continuous basis: costs incurred to the extent these relate to services performed up to the reporting date: or achievement of contractual milestones where relevant.
As described on page 122, sales of products and services are treated as though they are a single contract where these components have been negotiated as a single commercial package and are so closely interrelated that they do not operate independently of each other and are considered to form a single transaction with an overall profit margin.
The total revenue is allocated between the two components such that the total agreed discount to list prices is allocated to revenue for each of the two components pro rata, based on list prices.
The revenue is then recognised for each component on this basis as the products are delivered and services provided, as described above.
Where the contractual price of the OE component is below the revenue allocated from the combined arrangement, this will give rise toanasset included in amounts recoverable on contracts.
This asset reduces as services are provided, increases as costs are incurred, andreduces to zero by the end of the contract.
Where the balance is a liability, it is recognised in accruals and deferred income.
Provided that the outcome of construction contracts can be assessed with reasonable certainty, the revenues and costs on such contracts are recognised based on stage of completion and the overall contract profitability.
Full provision is made for any estimated losses to completion ofcontracts, having regard to the overall substance of the arrangements.
Progress payments received, when greater than recorded revenue, are deducted from the value of work in progress except to the extent that payments on account exceed the value of work in progress on any contract where the excess is included in accruals and deferred income within trade and other payables.
The amount by which recorded revenue of long-term contracts is in excess of payments on account is classified as amounts recoverable on contracts and is separately disclosed within trade and other receivables.
TotalCare arrangements As described above, these are accounted for on a stage of completion basis, with the stage of completion based on the proportion of flying hours completed compared to the total estimated under the contract.
In making the assessment of future revenues, costs and the level of profit recognised the Group takes account of: i the forecast utilisation of the engines by the operator: ii the forecast costs to maintain the engines in accordance with the contractual requirements the principal variables being the time between shop visits and the cost of each shop visit: and iii the recoverability of any contract asset arising.
The Group benchmarks the forecast costs against previous programmes, recognising that the reliability of the forecasts will improve as operational experience of the engine increases.
To the extent that actual costs differ from forecast costs or that forecast costs change, the cumulative impact is recognised in the period.
An allowance is made against forecast contract revenues given the potential for reduced engine flying hours based on historical forecasting accuracy, the risk of aircraft being parked by the customer and the customers creditworthiness.
Again, changes in this allowance are recognised in the period.
Risk and revenue sharing arrangements RRSAs As described on page 122, the Group enters into arrangements with certain workshare partners under which these suppliers: i contribute to the forecast costs of developing an engine by performing their own development work, providing development parts and paying a non-refundable cash entry fee: and ii supply components for the production phase for which they receive consideration, which isan agreed proportion of the total programme revenues.
Both the suppliers contributions to the forecast non-recurring development costs and their consideration are determined by reference to their proportionate forecast scopes of supply relative to that of the engine overall.
Once the forecast costs and the scopes of supply have been agreed at the inception of the contract, each party is then accountable for its own incurred costs.
No accounting entries are recorded when the suppliers undertake development work or when development components are supplied.
Cash sums received are recognised in the income statement, as a reduction in research and development costs incurred, to match the expensing of the Groups related costs where the cash sums are received in advance of the related costs being expensed or where the related costs are capitalised as intangible assets, the recognition of the cash received is deferred in accruals and deferred income to match the recognition of the related expense or the amortisation of the related intangible asset respectively.
The payments to suppliers of their shares of the programme revenues for their production components are charged to cost of sales as programme revenues arise.
The Group has arrangements with partners who do not undertake development work or supply parts.
Such arrangements are considered to be financial instruments as defined by IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are accounted for using the amortised costmethod.
126 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Government investment Where a government or similar body has previously invested in a development programme, the Group treats payments to that body as royalty payments, which are matched to related sales.
Government grants Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as to match them with the related expenses that they are intended to compensate.
Where grants are received in advance of the related expenses, they are included in the balance sheet as deferred income.
Non-monetary grants are recognised at fair value.
Interest Interest receivable payable is credited charged to the income statement using the effective interest method.
Where borrowing costs are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, such costs are capitalised as part of the specific asset.
Taxation The tax charge credit on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax: Current tax is the expected tax payable for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and anyadjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts ofthe assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes and is calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled.
Tax is charged or credited in the income statement or other comprehensive income OCI as appropriate, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is not recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill or for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised.
Foreign currency translation Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting Group undertaking are translated into thefunctional currency at the exchange rates ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the rate ruling at the year end.
Exchange differences arising on foreign exchange transactions and the retranslation of assets and liabilities into functional currencies at the rate ruling at the year end are taken into account in determining profit before taxation.
The trading results of Group undertakings are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the year.
The assets and liabilities of overseas undertakings, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the year end.
Exchange adjustments arising from the retranslation of the opening net investments, and from the translation of the profits or losses ataverage rates, are recognised in OCI.
The cumulative amount of exchange adjustments was, on transition to IFRS in 2004, deemed to be nil.
Financial instruments IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement requires the classification of financial instruments into separate categories forwhich the accounting requirement is different.
The Group has classified its financial instruments as follows: Short-term investments are generally classified as available for sale.
Short-term deposits principally comprising funds held with banks and other financial institutions, trade receivables and short-term investments not designated as available for sale are classified as loans and receivables.
Borrowings, trade payables, financial RRSAs, and C Shares are classified as other liabilities.
Derivatives, comprising foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and commodity swaps are classified as fair value through profit or loss.
Financial instruments are recognised at the contract date and initially measured at fair value.
Their subsequent measurement depends ontheir classification: Available for sale assets are held at fair value.
Changes in fair value arising from changes in exchange rates are included in the income statement.
All other changes in fair value are taken to equity.
On disposal, the accumulated changes in value recorded in equity are included in the gain or loss recorded in the income statement.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 CONSOLIDATED 127 1 Accounting policies continued Loans and receivables and other liabilities are held at amortised cost and not revalued except for changes in exchange rates and forecast contractual cash flows, which are included in the income statement unless they are included in a fair value hedge accounting relationship.
Where such a hedging relationship exists, the instruments are revalued in respect of the risk being hedged, with the change in value included in the income statement.
Fair value through profit or loss items are held at fair value.
Changes in fair value are included in the income statement unless the instrument is included in a cash flow hedge.
If the instruments are included in an effective cash flow hedging relationship, changes invalue are taken to equity.
When the hedged forecast transaction occurs, amounts previously recorded in equity are recognised intheincome statement.
Financial instruments are derecognised on expiry or when all contractual rights and obligations are transferred.
Hedge accounting The Group does not generally apply hedge accounting in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts or commodity swaps held to manage the cash flow exposures of forecast transactions denominated in foreign currencies or in commodities respectively.
The Group applies hedge accounting in respect of transactions entered into to manage the fair value and cash flow exposures of its borrowings.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are held to manage the fair value exposures of borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and are designated as fair value hedges.
Interest rate swaps are held to manage the interest rate exposures and are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges of fixed and floating rate borrowings respectively.
Changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and changes in fair value of the related hedged item are recognised directly in the income statement.
Changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges and are effective are recognised directly in equity.
Any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationships is included in the income statement.
The amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement to match the recognition of the hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, for cash flow hedges and if the forecast transaction remains probable, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
The portion of a gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve will be recycled to profit when the foreign operation is sold.
Business combinations and goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities unless the fair value cannot be measured reliably, in which case the value is subsumed into goodwill.
Where fair values of acquired contingent liabilities cannot be measured reliably, the assumed contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the same manner as other .
Goodwill recognised represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value to the Group of the net of theidentifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
On transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004, business combinations were not retrospectively adjusted to comply with Adopted IFRS and goodwill was recognised based on the carrying value under the previous accounting policies.
Goodwill in respect of the acquisition of a subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint arrangements and associates is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Certification costs and participation fees Costs incurred in respect of meeting regulatory certification requirements for new civil aero engine aircraft combinations including payments made to airframe manufacturers for this and participation fees are carried forward in intangible assets to the extent that they can be recovered out of future sales and are charged to the income statement over the programme life on a straight-line basis, up to a maximum of 15 years from the entry into service of the product.
Research and development In accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets, expenditure incurred on research and development is distinguished as relating either to a research phase or to a development phase.
All research phase expenditure is charged to the income statement.
Development expenditure is capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset only if it meets strict criteria, relating in particular to technical feasibility and generation of future economic benefits.
As described on page 123, the Group considers that it is not possible to distinguish reliably between research and development activities until relatively late in the programme.
Expenditure capitalised is amortised over its useful economic life on a straight-line basis, up to a maximum of 15 years from the entry into service of the product.
128 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Contractual aftermarket rights As described under key judgements on page 121, the Group may sell OE to customers at a price below its cost, on the basis that it also receives valuable aftermarket rights.
Such a sale is considered to give rise to an intangible asset which is recognised, in accordance with IAS 38, at the same time as the revenue at an amount equal to the cash deficit and is amortised on a straight-line basis over the period that highly probable aftermarket sales are expected to be earned.
Customer relationships The fair value of customer relationships recognised as a result of a business combination relate to the acquired companys established relationships with its existing customers that result in repeat purchases and customer loyalty.
Amortisation occurs on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of 15 years.
Software The cost of acquiring software that is not specific to an item of property, plant and equipment is classified as an intangible asset and amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of five years.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value, of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives.
No depreciation is provided on assets in the course of construction.
Estimated useful lives are as follows: Land and buildings, as advised by the Groups professional advisers: freehold buildings five to 45 years average 26 years : leasehold buildings lower of advisers estimates or period of lease: no depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Plant and equipment five to 25 years average 12 years.
Aircraft and engines five to 20 years average 13 years.
Where the Group obtains effective control of customers installed engines as a result of a TotalCare Flex arrangement, the fair value of these engines is recognised as an addition shown separately in note 10.
The corresponding liability is recognised either as deferred revenue or a financial liability depending on the precise nature of the arrangement.
Operating leases Payments made and rentals received under operating lease arrangements are charged credited to the income statement on a straightlinebasis.
Impairment of non-current assets Impairment of non-current assets is considered in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent of other assets, impairment is considered for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually.
Other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investments are assessed for any indications of impairment annually.
If any indication of impairment is identified, an impairment test is performed to estimate the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be below the carrying value, the carrying value is reduced to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss recognised as an expense.
The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use or fair value less costs to sell, if this is readily available.
The value in use is the present value of future cash flows using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset.
Inventories Inventories and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a first-in, first-out basis.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads, including depreciation of property, plant and equipment, that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling prices less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, investments in money-market funds and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less on inception.
The Group considers overdrafts repayable on demand to be an integral part of its cash management activities and these are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 CONSOLIDATED 129 1 Accounting policies continued Post-retirement benefits Pensions and similar benefits principally healthcare are accounted for under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value, using a discount rate derived from high-quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency of the plan, whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value.
Surpluses in schemes are recognised as assets only if they represent economic benefits available to the Group in the future.
A liability is recognised to the extent that the minimum funding requirements in respect of past service will give rise to an unrecognisable surplus.
The service and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement: Current service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees.
Past service costs and settlements are recognised immediately.
Financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses and movements in unrecognised surpluses and minimum funding liabilities are recognised immediately in OCI.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payments The Group provides share-based payment arrangements to certain employees.
These are principally equity-settled arrangements and are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares or options that will vest, except where additional shares vest as a result of the total shareholder return TSR performance condition in the Performance Share Plan PSP.
Cash-settled share options grants in the International ShareSave plan are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The Group recognises a liability at the balance sheet date based on these fair values, taking into account the estimated number of options that will actually vest and the relative completion of the vesting period.
Changes in the value of this liability are recognised in the income statement for the year.
The cost of shares of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc held by the Group for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of employee share plans is deducted from equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
See note 21 for a further description of the share-based payment plans.
Customer financing support In connection with the sale of its products, the Group will, on occasion, provide financing support for its customers.
These arrangements fall into two categories: credit-based guarantees and asset-value guarantees.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, credit-based guarantees are treated as insurance contracts.
The Group considers asset-value guarantees to be non-financial liabilities and accordingly these are also treated as insurance contracts.
As described on page 123, the Directors consider the likelihood of crystallisation in assessing whether provision is required for any contingent liabilities.
The Groups contingent liabilities relating to financing arrangements are spread over many years and relate to a number of customers and a broad product portfolio, and are reported on a discounted basis.
Revisions to Adopted IFRS in 2016 There were no changes to accounting standards that had a material impact on the 2016 financial statements.
Revisions to IFRS not applicable in 2016 Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB are only applicable if endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments will simplify the classification of financial assets for measurement purposes, but is not anticipated to have a significant impact on the financial statements.
130 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective for the year beginning 1 January 2018, provides a single, principles-based five-step model to be applied to all sales contracts, based on the transfer of control of goods and services to customers.
It replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts currently included in IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IAS 18 Revenue.
The Group has undertaken significant analysis of how IFRS 15 should be implemented and has taken tentative accounting policy decisions.
Based on this analysis, we expect that adoption of IFRS 15 will have a significant impact on the timing of recognition of revenue on individual long-term contracts, most particularly in the Civil Aerospace business.
The most significant changes are: IFRS 15 contains more specific requirements on the combination of contracts.
Contracts can only be combined if they are with the same counterparty or related counterparties.
The existing standards require contracts with different counterparties to be combined where that reflects the overall substance of a transaction.
As a result, it will no longer be possible to link contracts entered into at the same time for: i installed OE, with an airframer: and ii long-term service agreements LTSAs, relating to that OE, with the aircraft operator.
For similar reasons, it will no longer be possible to recognise an intangible asset in respect of contractual aftermarket rights relating to future aftermarket business with an operator when OE is sold to an airframer.
For each performance obligation identified, IFRS 15 requires revenue to be recognised based on the transfer of control of the relevant goods or services.
In contrast, under the existing standards, revenue is recognised based on when risk and reward is transferred.
As a result it will no longer be possible to use flying hours or equivalent as a basis for measuring the stage of completion of LTSAs.
Compared to IAS 11, IFRS 15 includes only limited guidance on accounting for costs incurred to fulfil a performance obligation and in general these will be recognised as incurred.
It is no longer possible to defer or accrue costs to report a consistent margin percentage over the term of the LTSAs.
In summary, the impact of these changes will be that, upon adoption of IFRS 15: Revenues and costs relating to deliveries of engines will be recognised when they are is delivered.
The revenue recognised will comprise that included in the contract with the airframer reduced if applicable by any OE concession agreed with the operator which IFRS 15 describes as a payment to a customers customer.
Consequently, the revenues and costs recognised on OE deliveries will more closely match the related cash flows.
No contractual aftermarket revenue will be allocated to the OE delivery where contracts are currently combined linked accounting and no intangible asset will be recognised where contracts are not currently combined unlinked accounting.
This will result in a loss being recognised on engine deliveries when the direct costs exceed the direct revenues.
Revenues on LTSAs will be recognised as services are performed rather than as the equipment is used engine flying hours as is the case under the current accounting policy.
The stage of completion will be measured using the actual costs incurred to date compared to the estimated costs to complete the performance obligation.
In practice the bulk of the revenue and costs will relate to overhaul activity which occurs at distinct points of time during the period of the LTSA.
As the first major overhaul typically occurs some years after delivery, this change will generally defer the recognition of revenue on LTSAs, as compared to the current accounting policy.
Taken together, had IFRS 15 been applicable with effect from 1 January 2015, the Group currently estimates the results for the year ended 31 December 2015 would have been as follows: IAS 11 and IAS 18 IFRS 15 Reported Underlying Reported Underlying bn bn bn bn Revenue Civil Aerospace original equipment 3.3 2.6 Civil Aerospace aftermarket services 3.7 3.5 Other segments 6.4 6.4 Total revenue 13.7 13.4 12.8 12.5 Gross profit Civil Aerospace 1.5 0.6 Other segments 1.7 1.7 Total gross profit 3.3 3.2 2.4 2.3 Profit before financing and taxation 1.5 1.5 0.6 0.6 Net financing 1.3 0.1 1.3 0.1 Taxation 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.1 Profit for the year 0.1 1.1 0.6 0.4 Net assets 5.0 2.0 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 CONSOLIDATED 131 1 Accounting policies continued The Group plans to adopt IFRS 15 in 2018 using the full retrospective approach.
The comparative 2017 results included in the 2018 financial statements will be restated, with an adjustment to equity as at 1 January 2017.
The Group will continue to work during 2017 to design, implement and refine procedures to apply the new requirements of IFRS 15 and to finalise accounting policy choices.
As a result of this ongoing work, it is possible that some changes to the impact above may result.
IFRS 16 Leases effective for the year ending 31 December 2019, not yet endorsed by the EU will require all leases to be recognised on the balance sheet.
Currently, IAS 17 Leases only requires leases categorised as finance leases to be recognised on the balance sheet, with leases categorised as operating leases not recognised.
In broad terms, the impact will be to recognise a lease liability and corresponding asset forthe operating lease commitments set out in note 22.
The Group does not consider that any other standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable, will have a significant impact on the financial statements.
2 Segmental analysis The analysis by business segment is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, on the basis of those segments whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Board the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8, as follows: Civil Aerospace development, manufacture, marketing and sales of commercial aero engines and aftermarket services.
Defence Aerospace development, manufacture, marketing and sales of military aero engines and aftermarket services.
Power Systems development, manufacture, marketing and sales of reciprocating engines and power systems.
Marine development, manufacture, marketing and sales of marine-power propulsion systems and aftermarket services.
Nuclear development, manufacture, marketing and sales of nuclear systems for civil power generation and naval propulsion systems.
The operating results are reviewed by the Board and are prepared on an underlying basis, which the Board considers reflects better the economic substance of the Groups trading during the year and provides financial measures that, together with the results prepared in accordance with Adopted IFRS, allow better analysis of the factors affecting the years results compared to the prior year.
The principles adopted to determine underlying results are: Underlying revenues and costs Where revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group undertaking and the Group hedges the net exposure, these reflect the achieved exchange rates arising on derivative contracts settled to cover the net exposure.
These achieved exchange rates are applied to all relevant revenues and costs, including those for which there is a natural offsetting position, rather than translating the offsetting transactions at spot rates.
The underlying profits would be the same under both approaches, but the Board considers that the approach taken provides a better indication of trends over time.
Underlying profit before financing In addition to the impact of exchange rates on revenues and costs above, adjustments have been made to exclude one-off past service costs or credits on post-retirement schemes, exceptional restructuring costs associated with the substantial closure or exit of a site, facility or line of business or other major transformation activities, the effect of acquisition accounting, the effect of business disposals, the impairment of goodwill, and in 2016 financial penalties from agreements with investigating bodies.
Underlying profit before taxation In addition to those adjustments in underlying profit before financing: Includes amounts realised from settled derivative contracts and revaluation of relevant assets and liabilities to exchange rates forecast to be achieved from future settlement of derivative contracts.
Excludes unrealised amounts arising from revaluations required by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, changesin value of financial RRSA contracts arising from changes in forecast payments andthe net impact of financing costs related to post-retirement scheme benefits.
Taxation The tax effect of the adjustments above are excluded from the underlying tax charge.

DEFERRED TAXATION ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Following announcements in the Summer Budget 2015 and the Budget 2016, the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020.
The Summer Budget 2015 had originally announced that the rate would reduce to 18% from 1 April 2020.
This reduction was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015 and so the prior year deferred tax assets and liabilities were calculated at this rate.
The subsequent announcement in the Budget 2016 that the rate will reduce to 17% from 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016.
As this reduction was substantively enacted prior to the year end, the closing deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated at this rate.
The resulting charges or credits have been recognised in the income statement except to the extent that they relate to items previously charged or credited to OCI or equity.
Accordingly, in 2016, 30m has been charged to the income statement 2015: 18m credited and 2m has been charged directly to equity 2015: 3m.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 CONSOLIDATED 139 5 Taxation continued The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to 276m 2015: 347m.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the potential withholding tax due on the remittance of undistributed profits as the Group is able to control the timing of such remittances and it is probable that consent will not be given in the foreseeable future.
6 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share EPS are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares held under trust, which have been treated as if they had beencancelled.
Diluted EPS are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year for the bonus element ofshare options.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 CONSOLIDATED 141 9 Intangible assets continued GOODWILL In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill as follows: CASH-GENERATING UNIT CGU OR GROUP OF CGUs Primary reporting 2016 2015 segment m m Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG Power Systems 871 739 Marine arising from the acquisitions of Vinters Limited, Scandinavian Electric Holding AS and ODIM ASA Marine 401 516 Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG Civil Aerospace 236 202 Other Various 29 46 1,537 1,503 Goodwill has been tested for impairment during 2016 on the following basis: The carrying values of goodwill have been assessed by reference to value in use.
These have been estimated using cash flows from the most recent forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on market conditions.
Given the long-term and established nature of many of the Groups products product lives are often measured in decades, these forecasts generally cover the next five-ten years.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the forecasts are based on a range of growth rates 2.0-3.5% that reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate.
The key assumptions for the impairment tests are the discount rate and, in the cash flow projections, the programme assumptions, the growth rates and the impact of foreign exchange rates on the relationship between selling prices and costs.
Impairment tests are performed using prevailing exchange rates.
Prior to 2016, goodwill in the Marine business was considered as separate CGUs, based on the original acquisitions including ODIM ASA, Scandinavian Electric Holdings and Vinters Limited formerly Vickers plc.
However, following re-organisations, including those resulting from the current transformation programme, we now consider that the Marine business excluding the UK marine defence business is a single CGU.
The Marine business has continued to be impacted by the low crude oil price and over supply of vessels to its offshore support customers.
The downturn has been deeper and more prolonged than forecast a year ago and, as a consequence, the Group has recognised an impairment loss of 200m to the carrying value of goodwill of the CGU.
This is included in cost of sales in the income statement, but excluded from the underlying results.
The impairment loss is based on a value in use calculation using cash flows forecast over a ten-year period which is considered to take account of the cyclicality of the market.
The impairment test indicated a recoverable amount of 473m including allowance for identified risks of 18m compared with a pre-impairment carrying value of 673m.
The Group has also recognised other impairments to goodwill of 19m, including 14m in relation to its North American civil nuclear business.
This reflects the current weakness in the services market, although the Directors expect these to recover in the medium term.
The principal value in use assumptions for goodwill balances considered to be individually significant are: Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG Discount rate 11.7% 2015: 11.7%.
Volume of equipment deliveries, pricing achieved and cost escalation.
These are based on current and known future programmes, estimates of capture of market share and long-term economic forecasts.
The principal foreign exchange exposures are on translating income in a variety of non-functional currencies into euros.
For the purposes of the impairment only, cash flows from recent management forecasts for a five-year period have been included.
Cash flows beyond five years are assumed to grow at 2% 2015: 2%.
Reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the goodwill to fall below its carrying value, which include a reduction in the level of cash generation of 13%, or an increase in the assumed discount rate of 1.5%.
At 31 December 2016, the value in use exceeded the carrying value by 440m.
Marine business Discount rate 13%, including an allowance of 0.8% to reflect uncertainties in market recovery and the achievement of cost savings, 2015: 13%.
Volume of equipment deliveries, capture of aftermarket and cost escalation.
These are based on current and known future programmes, estimates of customers fleet requirements and long-term economic forecasts.
The principal foreign exchange exposures are on translating income in a variety of non-functional currencies into Norwegian kroner.
For the purposes of the impairment test only, cash flows beyond the ten-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 2.5% 2015: 2.5%.
Any further deterioration of the market would require additional impairment.
For example if the market recovery were delayed by one year, compared to that assumed, this would result in an additional impairment of around 60m.
Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG Discount rate 13% 2015: 13%.
Volume of engine deliveries, flying hours of installed fleet and cost escalation.
The principal foreign exchange exposure is on translating US dollar income into euros.
The Directors do not consider that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the goodwill to fall below its carrying value.
The overall level of business would need to reduce by around 70% to cause an impairment of this balance.
142 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 9 Intangible assets continued OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Certification costs and participation fees, development costs and contractual aftermarket rights have been reviewed for impairment inaccordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Where an impairment test was considered necessary, it has been performed on the following basis: The carrying values have been assessed by reference to value in use.
These have been estimated using cash flows from the most recent forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on market conditions over the lives of the respective programmes.
The key assumptions underlying cash flow projections are assumed market share, programme timings, unit cost assumptions, discount rates, and foreign exchange rates.
The pre-tax cash flow projections have been discounted at 9-13% 2015: 9-13%, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for the estimated programme risk, for example taking account of whether or not the forecast cash flows arise from contracted business.
No impairment is required on this basis.
However, a combination of adverse changes in assumptions eg.
market size and share, unit costs and programme delays and other variables eg.
discount rate and foreign exchange rates, could result in impairment in future years.

On 28 November 2016, and following due diligence, the Group confirmed the valuation of 720m.
Under the agreement, consideration will be settled over a two-year period following completion in eight evenly spaced instalments of equal value.
The updated agreement allows flexibility to settle the consideration either in cash, in the form of Rolls-Royce shares or any mixture of the two, as preferred by Rolls-Royce.
A decision as to whether each payment will be settled in cash, shares or cash and shares will be determined by Rolls-Royce during the payment period.
Completion remains subject to regulatory clearances and is expected in 2017.

Fair values have been determined with reference to available market information at the balance sheet date, using the methodologies described below.
A These primarily comprise unconsolidated companies where fair value approximates to the book value.
B F air values are assumed to approximate to cost either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of the investments is reset after periods not exceeding six months.
C F air values of derivative financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash ows using prevailing interest rate curves.
Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
These financial instruments are included on the balance sheet at fair value, derived from observable market prices Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group uses various financial instruments to manage its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates.
Where the effectiveness ofa hedging relationship in a cash flow hedge is demonstrated, changes in the fair value that are deemed effective are included in the cash flow hedge reserve and released to match actual payments on the hedged item.
The Group uses commodity swaps to manage its exposure to movements in the price of commodities jet fuel and base metals.
To hedge the currency risk associated with a borrowing denominated in US dollars, the Group has currency derivatives designated as part of fair value hedges.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage its exposure to movements in interest rates.

RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange rate risk: liquidity risk: credit risk: interest rate risk: and commodity price risk.
The Board has approved policies for the management of these risks.
Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Group has significant cash ows most signicantly US dollars, followed by the euro denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant trading entity.
To manage its exposures to changes in values of future foreign currency cash ows, so as to maintain relatively stable long-term foreign exchange rates on settled transactions, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign currency transactions.
For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.
The Group also has exposures to the fair values of non-derivative financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies.
To manage the risk of changes in these fair values, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign exchange contracts, which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes.
The Group regards its interests in overseas subsidiary companies as long-term investments.
The Group aims to match its translational exposures by matching the currencies of assets and liabilities.
Where appropriate, foreign currency financial liabilities may be designated as hedges of the net investment.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to hold financial investments and maintain undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the Group has available funds to meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
The Group holds cash and short-term investments, which together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk is a key component of the Groups risk management activities.
The Group has credit policies covering both trading and financial exposures.
Credit risks arising from treasury activities are managed by a central treasury function in accordance with the Group credit policy.
The objective of the policy is to diversify and minimise the Groups exposure to credit risk from its treasury activities by ensuring the Group transacts strictly with BBB or higher-rated financial institutions based on pre-established limits per financial institution.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk to individual customers or counterparties.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its xed rate borrowings fair value risk, oating rate borrowings and cash and cash equivalents cash ow risk.
Interest rate derivatives are used to manage the overall interest rate prole within the Group policy, which is to maintain a higher proportion of net debt at floating rates of interest as a natural hedge to the net cash position.
These are designated as either fair value or cash ow hedges as appropriate.
Commodity risk The Group has exposures to the price of jet fuel and base metals arising from business operations.
To minimise its cash ow exposures to changes in commodity prices, the Group enters into derivative commodity transactions.
Other price risk The Groups cash equivalent balances represent investments in money-market instruments, with a term of up to three months.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 CONSOLIDATED 155 17 Financial instruments continued Some of the Groups borrowings are subject to the Group meeting certain obligations, including customary financial covenants.
If the Group fails to meet its obligations these arrangements give rights to the lenders, upon agreement, to accelerate repayment of the facilities.
There are no rating triggers contained in any of the Groups facilities that could require the Group to accelerate or repay any facility for a given movement in the Groups credit rating.
In addition, the Group has 2,280m 2015: 1,780m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities available for at least the next two years.

The main interest rate sensitivity for the Group arises as a result of the gross up of net cash and this is mitigated as described under the interest rate risk management policies on page 185.
C SHARES AND PAYMENTS TO SHAREHOLDERS The Company issues non-cumulative redeemable preference shares C Shares as an alternative to paying a cash dividend.
C Shares in respect of a year are issued in the following year.
Shareholders are able to redeem any number of their C Shares for cash.
Any C Shares retained attract a dividend of 75% of LIBOR on the 0.1p nominal value of each share, paid on a twice-yearly basis, and have limited voting rights.
The Company has the option to compulsorily redeem the C Shares, at any time, if the aggregate number of C Shares in issue is less than 10% of the aggregate number of C Shares issued, or on the acquisition or capital restructuring of the Company.
Movements in issued and fully paid C Shares during the year were as follows: 2016 2015 Nominal Nominal value value Millions m Millions m At 1 January 28,960 29 22,005 22 Issued 300,993 301 429,536 430 Redeemed 301,828 302 422,581 423 At 31 December 28,125 28 28,960 29 Payments to shareholders in respect of the year represent the value of C Shares to be issued in respect of the results for the year.

Prior figures have not been restated.
Provisions for warranties and guarantees primarily relate to products sold and generally cover a period of up to three years.
Provisions for contract loss and restructuring are generally expected to be utilised within two years.
In connection with the sale of its products the Group will, on some occasions, provide nancing support for its customers generally inrespect of civil aircraft.
The Groups commitments relating to these nancing arrangements are spread over many years, relate toanumber of customers and a broad product portfolio and are generally secured on the asset subject to the financing.
These include commitments of US$3.2bn 2015:US$3.1bn to provide borrowing facilities to enable customers to purchase aircraft of which approximately US$421m could be called during 2017.
These facilities may only be used if the customer is unable to obtain financing elsewhere and are priced at a premium to the market rate.
Consequently the Directors do not consider that there is a significant exposure arising from the provision ofthese facilities.
Customer financing provisions cover guarantees provided for asset value and or financing.
These guarantees, the risks arising and the process used to assess the extent of the risk are described under the heading Customer financing in the Financial review on page 39.
It is estimated that the provision will be utilised as follows: 2016 2015 m m Potential claims with specific claim dates: In one year or less 2 3 In more than one year but less than five years 12 12 In more than five years 5 5 19 20 Commitments on delivered aircraft in excess of the amounts provided are shown in the table below.
These are reported on a discounted basis at the Groups borrowing rate to reect better the time span over which these exposures could arise.
These amounts do not represent values that are expected to crystallise.
The commitments are denominated in US dollars.
As the Group does not generally adopt cash flow hedge accounting for future foreign exchange transactions, this amount is reported, together with the sterling equivalent at the reporting date spot rate.
The values of aircraft providing security are based on advice from a specialist aircraft appraiser.

The Groups captive insurance company retains a portion of the exposures it insures on behalf of the remainder of the Group.
Significant delays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost and timing of which cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date.
The insurance provisions are based on information currently available, however it is inherent in the nature of the business that ultimate liabilities may vary.
Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected liability as well as claims incurred but not yet reported.
Other provisions comprise a number of liabilities with varying expected utilisation rates.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 CONSOLIDATED 157 19 Post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes: The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets held in a separate trustee administered funds.
Employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on either their final or career average salaries and length of service.
Overseas defined benefit schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans and provide benefits in line with local practice.
Additionally in the US, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the Groups employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees.
The valuations of the defined benefit schemes are based on the most recent funding valuations, where relevant, updated by the scheme actuaries to 31 December 2016.
The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity, interest rate, inflation and investment risks.
In the UK, and in the principal US pension schemes, the Group has adopted investment policies to mitigate some of these risks.
This involves investing a significant proportion of the schemes assets in Liability Driven Investment portfolios, which hold investments designed to offset interest rate and inflation rate risks.
In addition, in the UK, the scheme has invested in a longevity swap, which is designed to offset longevity risks in respect of approximately two thirds of current pensioners.
During the year, the Group has restructured its UK defined benefit arrangements.
Four of the five UK schemes have been merged together into a consolidated scheme, renamed the Rolls-Royce UK Pension Fund.
All future defined benefit accrual will be provided from this scheme, limited to employees who joined the Company before 1 April 2007.
The scheme merger will simplify future administration and governance.
As part of this merger, the three transferring schemes are being wound up.
Members of these schemes with benefits below statutory limits were offered lump sums in exchange for their existing benefits, which resulted in a settlement charge of 2m.
The liabilities of the fifth scheme, the Vickers Group Pension Scheme, have been fully bought-out with a UK insurance company, Legal & General Assurance Company Limited, resulting in a settlement charge of 301m.
This scheme is expected to be wound up in 2017.
Neither of these transactions required any additional funding by the Group.

The Consumer Price Index is assumed to be 1.1% lower.
Discount rates are determined by reference to the market yields on AA rated corporate bonds.
The rate is determined by using the profile of forecast benefit payments to derive a weighted average discount rate from the yield curve.
The inflation assumption is determined by the market implied assumption based on the yields on long-term indexed linked government securities and increases in salaries are based on actual experience, allowing for promotion, of the real increase above inflation.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the UK pension schemes are derived from the SAP actuarial tables, with future improvements in line with the CMI 2016 Proposed 2015 core projections and long-term improvements of 1.5%.
Where appropriate, these are adjusted to take account of the relevant schemes actual experience.
Other assumptions have been set on advice from the relevant actuary, having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and the assumptions used in the most recent funding valuation.
The rate of increase of pensions in payment is based on the rules of the relevant scheme, combined with the inflation assumption where the increase is capped.
Assumptions for overseas schemes are less significant and are based on advice from local actuaries.

2 Under the longevity swap, the Rolls-Royce UK Pension Fund has agreed an average life expectancy of pensioners with a counterparty.
If pensioners live longer than expected the counterparty will make payments to the Fund to offset the additional cost of paying pensioners.
If the reverse applies the cost of paying pensioners will be reduced but the scheme will be required to make payments to the counterparty.
The longevity swap is valued at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 Level 3.
The investment strategy for the UK scheme is controlled by the Trustee in consultation with the Company.
The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.
The longevity swap is valued by the scheme actuaries based on the difference between the agreed longevity assumptions at inception and actual longevity experience.
All other fair values are provided by the fund managers.
Where available, the fair values are quoted prices eg.
listed equity, sovereign debt and corporate bonds.
Unlisted investments private equity are included at values provided by the fund manager in accordance with relevant guidance.
Other significant assets are valued based on observable inputs such as yield curves.
FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS The Group expects to contribute approximately 210m to its defined benefit schemes in 2017.
In the UK, the funding is based on a statutory triennial funding valuation process.
This includes a negotiation between the Group and the Trustee on actuarial assumptions used to value obligations Technical Provisions or TPs which may differ from those used for accounting set out above.
In particular, the discount rate used to value TPs must be prudent and take account of the investment strategy, rather than being based on yields of AA corporate bonds.
Following the triennial valuation process, a Schedule of Contributions SoC must be agreed which sets out the required contribution for current service.
If the scheme is in deficit, the SoC must also include agreed contributions from the employer to eliminate any deficit.
The most recent update provided to the Trustee, as at 30 September 2016, showed that the UK scheme was estimated to be 108% funded on a provisional TPs basis calculated using a discount rate equal to UK Government bond yields plus 0.5%.
Contributions to this scheme are currently being paid in line with the SoCs of the predecessor schemes in place pre-merger, which result in an average contribution rate of 30.8% of salary.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 CONSOLIDATED 161 19 Post-retirement benefits continued The first consolidated funding valuation is planned to be undertaken as at 31 March 2017.
Any adjustment to contributions payable following this valuation are expected to take effect in 2018.
Sensitivities The calculations of the defined benefit obligations are sensitive to the assumptions set out above.
The following table summarises how the estimated impact of a change in a significant assumption would affect the UK defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2016, while holding all other assumptions constant.
This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
For the most significant funded schemes, the investment strategies hedge the risks from interest rates and inflation measured on a proxy solvency basis.
For the UK scheme, the interest rate and inflation hedging is currently based on UK Government bond yields without any adjustment for any credit spread.
The longevity risk of approximately two thirds of UK pensioner liabilities is also hedged.
Where appropriate, the table also includes the corresponding movement in the value of the plan assets.
2016 2015 m m 1 Reduction in the discount rate of 0.25% Obligation 625 524 Plan assets LDI portfolio 630 569 1 Increase in inflation of 0.25% Obligation 320 249 Plan assets LDI portfolio 272 231 Real increase in salaries of 0.25% Obligations 115 91 One year increase in life expectancy Obligations 415 308 1 The differences between the sensitivities on obligations and plan assets arise largely due to differences in the methods used to value the obligations for accounting purposes and the adopted proxy solvency basis.
On a UK Government bond yield basis the correlation is approximately 86% for discount rates and 89% for inflation.

FAIR VALUES OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PLANS The weighted average fair value per share of equity-settled share-based payment plans granted during the year, estimated at the date ofgrant, are as follows: 2016 2015 PSP 25% TSR uplift 714p 1,015p PSP 30% TSR uplift 731p n a PSP 50% TSR uplift 795p 1,036p ShareSave three-year grant n a 192p ShareSave five-year grant n a 219p APRA n a n a PSP The fair value of shares awarded under the PSP is calculated using a pricing model that takes account of the non-entitlement to dividends orequivalent during the vesting period and the market-based performance condition based on expectations about volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the group of FTSE 100 companies and which incorporates into the valuation the interdependency between share price performance and TSR vesting.
This adjustment increases the fair value of the award relative to the share price at the date of grant.
ShareSave The fair value of the options granted under the ShareSave plan is calculated using a binomial pricing model that assumes that participants will exercise their options at the beginning of the six-month window if the share price is greater than the exercise price.
Otherwise it assumes that options are held until the expiration of their contractual term.
This results in an expected life that falls somewhere between the start and end of the exercise window.
APRA The fair value of shares awarded under APRA is calculated as the share price on the date of the award, excluding expected dividends orequivalent.

On 6 December 2012, the Company announced that it had passed information to the Serious Fraud Office SFO, following a request from the SFO for information about allegations of malpractice in overseas markets.
On 23 December 2013, the Company announced that it had been informed by the SFO that it had commenced a formal investigation.
Since the initial announcement, the Company continued its investigations and engaged with the SFO and other authorities in the UK, the US and elsewhere in relation to the matters of concern.
In January 2017, after full cooperation, the Company concluded deferred prosecution agreements with the SFO and the US Department of Justice and a leniency agreement with the MPF, the Brazilian federal prosecutors which are described on page 8.
Prosecutions of individuals may follow and investigations may be commenced in other jurisdictions.
In addition, we could still be affected by actions from customers and customers financiers.
The Directors are not currently aware of any matters that are likely to lead to a financial loss, but cannot anticipate all the possible actions that may be taken or their potential consequences.
Contingent liabilities exist in respect of guarantees provided by the Group in the ordinary course of business for product delivery, performance and reliability.
The Group has, in the normal course of business, entered into arrangements in respect of export finance, performance bonds, countertrade obligations and minor miscellaneous items.
Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which are for substantial amounts.
As a consequence of the insolvency of an insurer as previously reported, the Group is no longer fully insured against known and potential claims from employees who worked for certain of the Groups UK-based businesses for a period prior to the acquisition of those businesses by the Group.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the Directors do not expect any of these arrangements, legal actions or claims, after allowing for provisions already made, to result in significant loss to the Group.
The Groups share of equity accounted entities contingent liabilities is 12m 2015: 11m.
