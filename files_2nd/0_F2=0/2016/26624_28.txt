Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements 1.
Basis of preparation Accounting policies The audited consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and interpretations IFRICs as adopted by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Mans principal accounting policies have been consistently applied across the Group in the preparation of the financial statements.
Accounting policies are included in the relevant sections, and significant policies are outlined on page 105.
The impact, if any, of new accounting standards and amendments applicable to the year ended 31 December 2016 and accounting standards that are not yet effective are detailed on page 105.
Consolidated group and presentation currency The consolidated group is Man Group plc the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group or Man.
The stand-alone Parent Company financial statements of Man Group plc have been included as separate financial statements on pages 136 to 138.
Mans presentation currency is United States Dollars USD.
The consolidated financial information contained within these financial statements incorporates the results, cash flows and financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries Note 31 for the year to 31 December 2016.
Subsidiaries are entities including structured entities controlled by Man and are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to Man until the date that control ceases.
Control exists when Man has the power to direct the relevant activities, exposure to significant variable returns and the ability to utilise power to affect those returns.
All intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The acquisition date is the date on which Man effectively obtains control of the acquiree.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value at the acquisition date of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and equity instruments issued by the Group.
The fair value of an acquisition is calculated at the acquisition date by recognising the acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities at their fair values at that date, and costs relating to acquisitions are recognised in the Group income statement as incurred.
Any contingent consideration will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date, with any subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration recognised in the Group income statement and classified as an adjusting item.
Mans relationship with independent fund entities Man acts as the investment manager advisor to fund entities.
Man assesses such relationships on an ongoing basis to determine whether each fund entity is controlled by the Group and therefore consolidated into the Groups results.
Having considered all significant aspects of Mans relationships withfund entities, the directors are of the opinion that, although Man manages the assets of certain fund entities, where Man does not hold an investment in the fund entity the characteristics of control are not met, and that for most fund entities: the existence of independent boards of directors at the fund entities: rights which allow for the removal of the investment manager advisor: the influence of investors: limited exposure to variable returns: and the armslength nature of Mans contracts with the fund entities, indicate that Man does not control the fund entities and their associated assets, liabilities and results should not be consolidated into the Group financial statements.
Assessment of the control characteristics for all relationships with fund entities led to the consolidation of eleven funds for the year ended 31 December 2016 2015: nine, as detailed in Note 14.
An understanding of the aggregate funds under management FUM and the fees earned from fund entities is relevant to an understanding of Mans results and earnings sustainability, and this information is provided in the Chief Financial Officers review on pages 31 and 33.
Judgemental areas and accounting estimates Whether the Group controls certain funds through its investments in fund products and is required to consolidate them Note 14.2 and classification ofadjusting items Note 2 are the most significant areas of judgement.
The determination of fair values of goodwill and acquired intangibles Note 11, valuation of contingent consideration in relation to acquisitions Note 26 and recognition of deferred tax assets Note 8 are the key areas of estimation uncertainty.
These judgements and estimates have been an area of focus for the Group Board, and in particular the Audit and Risk Committee, during the year.
The report of the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee discusses the involvement of the Committee in this evaluation on pages 57 and 58.
Going concern Mans business activity is discussed on pages 1 to 45, together with the significant risk factors pages 36 to 39.
Mans liquidity and capital positions areset out in Note 13 and 21 respectively.
The directors monitor Mans capital and liquidity positions and forecasts throughout the year, and in addition they have approved a budget, medium-term financial plan, and a capital and liquidity plan, which cover the foreseeable future and include rigorous analysis of stressed capital and liquidity scenarios.
The directors have concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that Man has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Group and Parent Company financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis using the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of certain financial instruments that are held at fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale.
The directors have also made a longer-term viability statement, as set out on page 37.
Financial reporting controls Details of the Groups systems of internal control are included in the Corporate governance report as provided on pages 46 to 55.

Annual Improvements to IFRSs 20122014 Cycle and amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure initiative, and the IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation were adopted by Man in the current year, which have not had a significant impact.
The following standards and interpretations relevant to the Groups operations were issued by the IASB but are not yet mandatory: IFRS 9: Financial Instruments IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 16: Leases IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 replaces the classification and measurement models for financial instruments in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement with three classification categories: amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss and fair value through other comprehensive income.
Under IFRS 9, the Groups business model and the contractual cash flows arising from its investments in financial instruments will determine the appropriate classification.
All equity investments within the scope of IFRS 9 are to be measured at fair value, with gains or losses reported either in the Group income statement or, by election, through other comprehensive income.
However, where fair value gains and losses are recorded through other comprehensive income there will no longer be a requirement to transfer gains or losses to the Group income statement on impairment or disposal.
In addition, IFRS 9 introduces an expected loss model for the assessment of impairment.
The current incurred loss model under IAS 39 requires the Group to recognise impairment losses when there is objective evidence that an asset is impaired.
Under the expected loss model, impairment losses are recorded if there is an expectation of credit losses, even in the absence of a default event.
As a result of the nature of the assets and liabilities held on the Group balance sheet, the Group does not anticipate that IFRS 9 will have a material impact on its reported results.
IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and has yet to be endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 15 establishes a single, principles-based revenue recognition model to be applied to all contracts with customers.
Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service.
IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations.
New disclosures requirements are also introduced.
The group has considered the timing of management and performance fee recognition as a result of the future IFRS 15.
IFRS 15 is more prescriptive in terms of its recognition criteria whereas current IFRSs allow room for more judgement.
Certain specific requirements exist under the new standard in respect of variable fee income such that it is only recognised where the amount of revenue would not be subject to significant future reversals.
It is also noted that unless control of distinct goods or services are transferred on the outset, upfront fees would be regarded as advance payment and recognised in the future when those services are provided.
We have considered these key changes within the terms of our existing investment management agreements in place and as a result it is not anticipated that IFRS 15 will have a material impact on the reported results.
IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted subject to EU endorsement.
IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases and requires all operating leases in excess of one year, where the Group is the lessee, to be included on the Groups balance sheet, and recognising a right-of-use asset and a related lease liability representing the obligation to make lease payments.
The right-ofuse asset will be assessed for impairment annually incorporating any onerous lease assessments and amortised on a straight-line basis, with the lease liability being amortised using the effective interest method.
Certain optional exemptions are available under IFRS 16 for short-term less than 12 months and low-value leases.
The Group is currently performing its assessment of the anticipated impact of adoption of IFRS 16 on its reported results, however, we expect that, largely as a result of the Riverbank House premises lease as outlined in Note 28, this will result in a significant gross up of the Groups reported assets and liabilities.
No other standards or interpretations issued and not yet effective are expected to have an impact on the Groups financial statements.

Adjusted profit before tax Statutory loss profit before tax is adjusted to give a better understanding of the underlying profitability of the business.
The directors consider that in order to assess underlying operating performance, the Groups profit period on period is most meaningful when considered on a basis which excludes acquisition and disposal related items including non-cash items such as amortisation of acquired intangible assets and deferred tax movements relating to the recognition of tax losses in the US, impairment of assets, restructuring costs, and certain non-recurring gains or losses, which therefore reflects therecurring revenues and costs that drive the Groups cash flow and inform the base on which the Groups variable compensation is assessed.
The directors are consistent in their approach to the classification of adjusting items period to period, maintaining an appropriate symmetry between losses and gains and the reversal of any accruals previously classified as adjusting items.
These are explained in detail either below or in the relevant note.
Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m Note 2016 2015 Statutory loss profit before tax 272 184 1 Adjusting items : Acquisition and disposal related Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles 11 379 41 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 11 94 92 Revaluation of contingent consideration 26 40 62 Unwind of contingent consideration discount 7 19 17 Other costs professional fees and other integration costs 6 2 4 Recycling of FX revaluation to the Group income statement on liquidation of subsidiaries 6 2 1 Compensation restructuring 5 17 Other costs restructuring 6 4 7 Litigation, regulatory and other settlements 6 6 Adjusted profit 205 400 2 Tax on adjusted profit 28 39 Adjusted profit after tax 177 361 Note: 1 Tax on adjusting items is $28 million 2015: $15 million, which relates to amortisation of acquired intangible assets of $15 million 2015: $14 million, impairment of acquired intangible assets of $9 million 2015: nil, compensation restructuring costs of $3 million 2015: nil and other restructuring costs of $1 million 2015: $1 million.
2 The difference of $34 million 2015: $26 million between tax on statutory loss profit and tax on adjusted profit is made up of a tax credit of $28 million 2015: $15 million credit on adjusting items as above and a tax credit of $6 million 2015: $11 million relating to the recognition of a deferred tax asset which is classified as an adjusting item Note 8.
Details of the 2016 GLG and FRM goodwill and acquired intangibles impairments of $281 million and $98 million, respectively, are further detailed in Note 11 2015: impairment of $41 million relating to FRM.
Amortisation of acquired intangible assets primarily relates to the investment management agreements recognised on the acquisition of GLG and Numeric.
The revaluation of contingent consideration is an adjustment to the fair value of expected acquisition earn-out payments.
The credit of $40 million in the current year primarily relates to Numeric, with a $28 million fair value decrease in the contingent consideration largely as a result of a decrease in forecast management fees on long only products and a decrease in forecast net inflows, partially offset by higher than forecast FUM due to higher sales than expected for 2016.
The revaluation expense in 2015 largely relates to Numeric $61 million, primarily as a result of higher management fee margins than previously forecast, as well as higher than forecast FUM due to flows and performance in 2015.
The unwind of the discount on contingent consideration in 2016 primarily relates to Numeric $18 million, with the remainder arising from the FRM, Pine Grove, and BAML fund of funds contingent consideration and is included within finance expense Note 7.
In 2015, this related to the contingent consideration of Numeric, FRM, Pine Grove, BAML fund of funds, NewSmith and Silvermine.
In 2016, the acquisition related professional fees and other integration costs of $2 million relate to expenses incurred in association with the acquisition of Aalto which completed on 1 January 2017.
The prior year cost of $4 million related to the acquisitions of the Silvermine, NewSmith, BAML fund of funds and Numeric businesses.
In each of 2016 and 2015, some of the Groups foreign subsidiaries were liquidated, which had accumulated foreign currency translation reserves at the date of liquidation of $2 million loss and $1 million gain, respectively.
Upon liquidation of these subsidiaries the related foreign currency translation loss gain was recycled to the Group income statement.
Compensation restructuring costs of $17 million in 2016 relate to termination expenses incurred due to the restructuring of certain areas of the business.
Compensation costs incurred as part of restructuring are accounted for in full at the time the obligation arises, and include payments in lieu of notice, enhanced termination costs, and accelerated share-based and fund product based charges.
Other restructuring costs of $4 million in 2016 largely relate to a reassessment of our onerous property lease provision relating to Riverbank House ourmain London office and headquarters due to the finalisation of a contractual market-linked rental increase and a reassessment of the related sub-tenancy projections.
The market-linked increase was effective for rental periods from November 2015 and estimation of this for the year ended 31 December 2015 resulted in a similar restructuring charge.
The Riverbank House premises onerous lease was recorded as an adjusting item upon initial recognition.
The credit of $6 million to litigation, regulatory and other settlements in 2015 related to an insurance recovery of costs incurred in association with legal claims, which were included as an adjusting item in previous years.

Revenue Fee income is Mans primary source of revenue, which is derived from the investment management agreements that are in place with the fund entities.
Fees are generally based on an agreed percentage of the valuation of net asset value NAV or FUM and are typically charged in arrears.
Management fees net of rebates, which include all non-performance related fees and interest income from loans to fund products, are recognised in the year in which the services are provided.
Performance fees net of rebates relate to the performance of the funds managed during the year and are recognised when the quantum of the fee can beestimated reliably and has crystallised.
This is generally at the end of the performance period or upon early redemption by a fund investor.
Until the performance period ends, market movements could significantly move the NAV of the fund products.
For AHL, GLG and FRM strategies, Man will typically only earn performance fee income on any positive investment returns in excess of the high water mark, meaning we will not be able to earn performance fee income with respect to positive investment performance in any year following negative performance until that loss is recouped, at whichpoint a fund investors investment surpasses the high water mark.
Numeric performance fees are earned only when performance is in excess of a predetermined strategy benchmark positive alpha, with performance fees being generated for each strategy either based on achieving positive alpha which resets at a predetermined interval, i. e. every one to three years or exceeding high water mark.
Rebates relate to repayments of management and performance fees charged, typically in association with institutional investors, and are presented net within gross management and other fees and performance fees in the Group income statement.
Analysis of FUM, margins and performance is provided in the Chief Financial Officers Review on pages 31 to 33.
Distribution costs and asset servicing Distribution costs are paid to external intermediaries for their marketing and investor servicing, largely in relation to retail investors.
Distribution costs aretherefore variable with FUM and the associated management fee revenue.
Distribution costs are expensed over the period in which the service is provided.
Distribution costs have decreased largely as a result of the continued mix shift towards institutional FUM and the roll-off of guaranteed productFUM.
Asset servicing includes custodial, valuation, fund accounting and registrar functions performed by third-parties under contract to Man, on behalf of the funds.
The cost of these services vary based on FUM, transaction volumes, the number of funds, and fund NAVs.
The cost is recognised in the period in which the service is provided.
Compensation Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m 2016 2015 Salaries 159 158 Variable cash compensation 141 212 Share-based payment charge 18 18 Fund product based payment charge 37 35 Social security costs 23 33 Pension costs 10 6 Compensation costs before adjusting items 388 462 Restructuring Note 2 17 Total compensation costs 405 462 Compensation is the Groups largest cost and an important component of Mans ability to retain and attract talent.
In the short term, the variable component of compensation adjusts with revenues and profitability of the relevant business units.
In the medium term, the active management of headcount can reduce fixed compensation, if required.
Total compensation costs excluding adjusting items have decreased by 16% compared to 2015, largely due to the decrease in management and performance fee revenues year on year, as reflected in decreased variable cash compensation and associated social security costs.
Salaries are in line with prior year as a result of an increase in headcount due to continued investment in the business, which has been offset by a more favourable hedged pound sterling to USD rate in 2016 1.51 compared to the hedged rate in 2015 1.66.
Compensation costs before adjusting items are 48% of net revenue 2015: 43%.
Net revenue is defined as gross management and other fees, performance fees, income or gains on investments and other financial instruments, and share of post-tax profit of associates, less distribution costs.
Salaries and variable cash compensation are charged to the Group income statement in the period in which the service is provided, and include partner drawings.
The compensation ratio has increased as a result of the lower level of performance fee revenue.
The accounting for share-based and fund product based compensation arrangements is detailed in Note 20.
Pension costs relate to Mans defined contribution and defined benefit plans Note 22.

Income and expenses are allocated to these different jurisdictions based on transfer pricing methodologies set in accordance with the laws of the jurisdictions in which Man operates and international guidelines as laid out by the OECD.
The effective tax rate results from the combination of taxes paid on earnings attributable to the tax jurisdictions inwhich they arise.
The majority of the Groups profit was earned in the UK, Switzerland and the US.
The current effective tax rate of 2% 2015: 7% differs from the applicable underlying statutory tax rates principally as a result of the impairment of the GLG and FRM goodwill and intangibles being largely non-deductible for tax purposes, which is partially offset by the incremental recognition of the US deferred tax asset of $6 million 2015: $11million, as detailed on page 110, and the reassessment of tax exposures in Europe and Asia-Pacific during the year.
The effective tax rate is otherwise consistent with this earnings profile.
The effective tax rate on adjusted profits Note 2 is 14% 2015: 10%.
Accounting for tax involves a level of estimation uncertainty given the application of tax law requires a degree of judgement, which tax authorities maydispute.
Tax liabilities are recognised based on the best estimates of probable outcomes, with regard to external advice where appropriate.
Theprincipal factors which may influence our future tax rate are changes to tax regulation in the territories in which we operate, the mix of income andexpenses by jurisdiction, and the timing of recognition of available tax losses.
The current tax liabilities, as shown on the Group balance sheet, of $6 million 2015: $32 million comprise a gross current tax liability of $9 million 2015: $35 million net of a current tax asset of $3 million 2015: $3 million.
The tax credit on Mans total loss before tax is lower 2015: expense on profit before tax is lower than the amount that would arise using the theoretical effective tax rate applicable to the profits losses of the consolidated companies as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December $m 2016 2015 Loss profit before tax 272 184 Theoretical tax credit expense at UK rate: 20.00% 2015: 20.25% 54 37 Effect of: Overseas tax rates compared to UK 11 8 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous periods 7 17 Impairment of goodwill and other adjusting items Note 2 43 9 Share-based payments 2 2 Recognition of US deferred tax asset 6 11 Other 5 5 Tax credit expense 6 13 The effect of overseas tax rates compared to the UK includes the impact of the 0% effective tax rate of our US business, which made a loss for the year as a result of goodwill and intangibles impairment.
In the current year the adjustments to the tax charge in respect of previous periods largely relates to a $6 million credit due to the reassessment of tax exposures in Europe and Asia-pacific.
In 2015, adjustments in respect of previous periods primarily related to the reassessment of tax exposures in the UK and Switzerland.
The impairment of goodwill and other adjusting items reflects that there is no tax relief for the impairment of goodwill recognised in jurisdictions outside the US.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates expected to be applied when the deferred tax asset or liability is realised.

The credit to other comprehensive income and equity of $3 million 2015: $4 million relates to movements in the pension accrual, unrealised cash flow hedge balance and employee share schemes.
The Group has accumulated deferred tax assets in the US of $192 million 2015: $172 million.
The increase of $20 million is principally as a result of an increase in deferred tax assets due to goodwill and intangibles impairment.
These assets principally comprise accumulated operating losses from existing operations of $103 million 2015: $105 million and future amortisation of goodwill and intangibles assets generated from acquisitions of $72 million 2015: $59 million that will be available to offset future taxable profits in the US.
From the maximum available deferred tax assets of $192 million 2015: $172 million, a deferred tax asset of $25 million has been recognised on the Group balance sheet 2015: $19 million, representing amounts which can be offset against probable future taxable profits, an increase of $6 million from that recognised at 31 December 2015.
Probable future taxable profits are considered to be forecast profits for the next three years only, consistent with the Groups business planning horizon.
As a result of the recognised deferred tax asset and the remaining unrecognised available US deferred tax assets of $167 million 2015: $153 million, Man does not expect to pay federal tax on any taxable profits it may earn in the US for a number of years.
Accordingly, any movements in this US tax asset are classified as an adjusting item in Note 2.
The gross amount of losses for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised is $160 million 2015: $172 million, which will expire over a period of 12 to 20 years.
Earnings per ordinary share EPS The calculation of basic EPS is based on post-tax loss of $266 million 2015: profit of $171 million, and ordinary shares of 1,679,099,266 2015: 1,694,081,544, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares on issue during the period after excluding the shares owned by the Man Employee Trusts.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares on issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, being ordinary shares of 1,695,995,147 2015: 1,714,925,166.

The 2015 impairment of $41 million relates to FRM.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of identifiable net assets of the acquired business at the date ofacquisition.
Goodwill is carried on the Group balance sheet at cost less accumulated impairment, has an indefinite useful life, is not subject to amortisation and is tested for impairment annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Investment management agreements IMAs, distribution channels and brand names IMAs, distribution channels and brand names are recognised at the present value of the expected future cash flows and are amortised on a straightline basis over their expected useful lives, which are between three and 13 years IMAs and brands, and nine and 12 years distribution channels.
Man Group plc Annual Report 2016 111 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued 11.
Goodwill and acquired intangibles continued Allocation of goodwill to cash generating units For statutory accounting impairment review purposes, the Group has identified four cash generating units CGUs : AHL, GLG, FRM and Numeric.
Further details of these are provided below.
Calculation of recoverable amounts for cash generating units An impairment expense is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows CGUs.
The recoverable amounts of the Groups CGUs are assessed each year using a value in use calculation.
The value in use calculation gives a higher valuation compared to a fair value less cost to sell approach, as this would exclude some of the revenue synergies available to Man through its ability to distribute products using its well established distribution channels, which may not be fully available to other market participants.
The value in use calculations at 31 December 2016 use cash flow projections based on the Board approved financial plan for the year to 31 December 2017 and a further two years of projections 2018 and 2019, plus a terminal value.
The valuation analysis is based on best practice guidance whereby a terminal value is calculated at the end of a short discrete budget period and assumes, after this three year budget period, no growth in asset flows above the long-term growth rate.
In order to determine the value in use of each CGU, it is necessary to notionally allocate the majority of the Groups cost base relating to operations, product structuring, distribution and support functions, which are managed on a centralised basis.
During H2 2016, the directors reassessed the allocation methodology for the Groups shared costs which are not directly attributable to an individualCGU, in order to ensure that this best represents the proportionate share of costs attributable to the value of each.
Under the previous , under certain stressed scenarios, CGUs may have been disproportionately affected by the performance of other CGUs.
Thisexercise involved assessment of the fixed cost margins of each CGU prior to acquisition by Man, and subsequently allocating other shared items e. g. interest and depreciation to each CGU based on their proportionate net contribution to the profits of the Group.
This has resulted in a value in use output for each CGU which the directors feel best represents each CGUs individual performance and contribution to the Group.
Had we applied the revised shared costs allocation methodology at year end 31 December 2015 there would have been no change in the impairment assessment performed noimpairment recognised.
The value in use calculations for AHL, FRM and GLG continue to be presented on a post-tax basis, consistent with the prior year, given most comparable market data is available on a post-tax basis.
The Numeric CGU value in use calculation has also been presented on a post-tax basis, compared with pre-tax for the year ended 31 December 2015, in order to aid comparability between the CGUs.
In determining the value of Numerics future tax obligations, we have considered the forecast consumption of available US tax losses Note 8.
The value in use calculations presented on a post-tax basis are not significantly different to their pre-tax equivalent.
The assumptions applied in the value in use calculation are derived from past experience and assessment of current market inputs.
A bifurcated discountrate has been applied to the modelled cash flows to reflect the different risk profile of net management fee income and net performance fee income.
The discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital using a risk free interest rate, together with an equity risk premium and an appropriate market beta derived from consideration of Mans beta, similar alternative asset managers, and the asset management sector as a whole.
The terminal value is calculated based on the projected closing FUM at 31 December 2019 and applying a mid-point of a range of historical multiples to the forecast cash flows associated with management and performance fees.
The recoverable amount of each CGU has been assessed at 31 December 2016.
The key assumptions applied to the value in use calculations for each of the CGUs are provided below.
Key assumptions: AHL GLG FRM Numeric Compound average annualised growth in FUM over three years 12% 3% 1% 9% Discount rate 1 Management fees 11% 11% 11% 11% 2 Performance fees 17% 17% 17% 17% 3 Terminal value mid-point of range of historical multiples Management fees 13.0x 13.0x 5.3x 14.0x Performance fees 5.5x 5.5x 2.1x 6.0x Notes: 1 The pre-tax equivalent of the net management fees discount rate is 13%, 13%, 13% and 15% for each of the AHL, GLG, FRM and Numeric CGUs, respectively.
2 The pre-tax equivalent of the net performance fees discount rate is 20%, 20%, 20% and 22% for each of the AHL, GLG, FRM and Numeric CGUs, respectively.
3 The implied terminal growth rates for the AHL, GLG, FRM and Numeric CGUs are 2%, 2%, -10% and 4%, respectively.
The results of the valuations are further explained in the following sections, including sensitivity tables which show scenarios whereby the key assumptions are changed to stressed assumptions, indicating the modelled headroom or impairment that would result.
Each assumption, or set of assumptions, is stressed in isolation.
The results of these sensitivities make no allowance for actions that management would take if such market conditions persisted.

Goodwill and acquired intangibles continued AHL cash generating unit The AHL value in use calculation at 31 December 2016 indicates a value of $2.5 billion, with around $2.0 billion of headroom over the carrying value ofthe AHL business.
Therefore, no impairment charge is deemed necessary at 31 December 2016 2015: nil.
The valuation at 31 December 2016 is around $1.2 billion lower than the value in use calculation at 31 December 2015, primarily due to lower opening FUM as a result of lower than forecast performance of quant alternative products in 2016, as well as a reduction in forecast investment performance and an increase in shared costs as a result of reassessment of the Groups shared costs allocations as previously detailed.

3 An increase decrease of $233 million.
GLG cash generating unit The GLG value in use calculation at 31 December 2016 indicates a value of $289 million, which suggests an impairment of $281 million 2015: nil based on the carrying value of the GLG business.
The valuation at 31 December 2016 is around $600 million lower than the value in use calculation at 31 December 2015, primarily due to a lower opening FUM as a result of lower performance and net flows compared to that previously forecast, as well as a weakening of industry growth forecasts during the year, partially offset by a decrease in shared costs as a result of the reassessment of the Groups shared costs allocations.
The GLG CGU impairment of $281 million impairs the total GLG goodwill balance of $222 million, and further impairs the other acquired intangibles balances relating to investment management agreements, distribution channels and brands by a total of $59 million.

FRM cash generating unit The FRM value in use calculation at 31 December 2016 indicates a value of $39 million, which suggests an impairment of $98 million based on the carrying value of the FRM business.
The valuation at 31 December 2016 is $160 million lower than the value in use calculation at 31 December 2015, primarily as a result of the faster than previously anticipated 2016 and forecast FUM mix shift towards lower margin infrastructure mandates and reduced prospects for the traditional fund of funds business, partially offset by a decrease in shared costs as a result of the reassessment of the Groups shared costs allocations.
The FRM CGU impairment of $98 million erodes the total FRM goodwill balance of $97 million, and further impairs the other acquired intangibles balances relating to investment management agreements and brands by a total of $1 million.

Goodwill and acquired intangibles continued Numeric cash generating unit The Numeric value in use calculation at 31 December 2016 indicates a value of $469 million, with around $190 million of headroom over the carrying value of the Numeric business.
The valuation at 31 December 2016 is around $140 million higher than the value in use calculation at 31 December 2015, primarily as a result of higher opening FUM due to higher sales of long only products than forecast and a decrease in shared costs as a result of the reassessment of the Groups shared costs allocations, partially offset by a decrease in the forecast management fees on new sales and net inflows on long only products.

Liquidity resources support ongoing operations and potential liquidity requirements under stressed scenarios.
The amount of potential liquidity requirements is modelled based on scenarios that assume stressed market and economic conditions.
With the exception of committed purchase arrangements Note 28.4, the funding requirements for Man relating to the investment management process are discretionary.
The liquidity profile ofMan is monitored on a daily basis and the stressed scenarios are updated regularly.
The Board reviews Mans funding resources at each Board meeting and on an annual basis as part of the strategic planning process.
Mans available liquidity is considered sufficient to cover current requirements and potential requirements under stressed scenarios.
In September 2014, Man issued $150 million ten-year fixed rate reset callable guaranteed subordinated notes Tier 2 notes, with associated issuance costs of $1 million.
The Tier 2 notes were issued with a fixed coupon of 5.875% until 15 September 2019.
The notes may be redeemed in whole at Mans option on 16 September 2019 at their principal amount, subject to FCA approval.
If the notes are not redeemed at this time then the coupon willreset to the five-year mid-swap rate plus 4.076% and the notes will be redeemed on 16 September 2024 at their principal amount.

Cash, liquidity and borrowings continued Borrowings are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The difference between the amount repayable at maturity on the borrowings and the carrying value is amortised over the period up to the expected maturity of the associated debt in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
Cash and cash equivalents at year end comprises $222 million 2015: $250 million of cash at bank on hand, $102 million 2015: $336 million in short-term deposits and $65 million 2015: nil of US Treasury bills.
Cash ring-fenced for regulated entities totalled $28 million 2015: $35 million.
Cashis invested in accordance with strict limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite, which consider both the security and availability of liquidity.
Accordingly, cash is held in on-demand deposit bank accounts and short-term bank deposits, and is invested in short-term US Treasury bills.
At 31 December 2016, the $324 million cash balance excluding US Treasury bills and cash held by consolidated fund entities is held with 18 banks 2015: $586 million with 22 banks.
The single largest counterparty bank exposure of $88 million is held with an BBB rated bank 2015: $100 million with an A rated bank.
At 31 December 2016, balances with banks in the AA ratings band aggregate to $109 million 2015: $239 million and balances with banks in the A ratings band aggregate to $127 million 2015: $293 million.
During October 2016, the Group reduced $500 million of the $1 billion syndicated revolving loan facility.
The remaining $500 million facility was undrawn at 31 December 2016.
The previous committed revolving credit facility of $1,525 million was refinanced during 2015 and replaced with a newcommitted syndicated revolving loan facility of $1 billion undrawn at 31 December 2015.
The new facility was put in place as a five-year facility and includes the option for Man to request the banks to extend the maturity date by one year on each of the first and second anniversaries.
The participant banks have the option to accept or decline Mans request.
Before the first anniversary in June 2016, the banks were asked to extend thematurity date of the facility by a year and banks with participations totalling 98% of the facility accepted the request.
As a result of the maturity extension and following the cancellation of $500 million of the facility, $10 million is scheduled to mature in June 2020, with the remainder maturing inJune 2021.
Tomaintain maximum flexibility, the facility does not include financial covenants.
Disclosures in relation to financial guarantees and commitments are included in Note 28.
Foreign exchange and interest rate risk Man is subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities.
In respect of Mans monetary assets and liabilities which earn incur interest indexed to floating rates, as at 31 December 2016 a 50bp increase decrease in these rates, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a $1 million increase decrease 2015: $2 million increase or $1million decrease innet interest income.
A 10% strengthening weakening of the USD against all other currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a foreign exchange loss gain of $3 million 2015: $2 million loss gain, with a corresponding impact on equity.
This exposure is based on USD balances held by non-USD functional currency entities and non-USD balances held by USD functional currency entities within the Group.
In certain circumstances, the Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its risk associated with foreign exchange movements.
Where fixed foreign currency denominated costs are hedged, the associated derivatives may be designated as cash flow hedges.
Effective unrealised gains or losseson these instruments are recognised within the cash flow hedge reserve in equity and, when realised, these are reclassified to the Group income statement in the same line as the hedged item.
The realisation of foreign currency operating cash flows and the associated forward foreign currency derivative contracts generally arise on a monthly basis.
The fair value of derivatives held in relation to the Groups cash flow hedges at 31 December 2016 is a liability of $18 million 2015: $7 million.
The Group also hedges its exposure to net investments in foreign operations through forward foreignexchange contracts where appropriate, with any effective gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in thecumulative translation adjustment reserve within equity Note 21.
The fair value of derivatives held in relation to the Groups net investment hedges at 31 December 2016 is an asset of $1 million 2015: nil.
Any ineffective portion of these hedges is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included within income or gains on investments and other financial instruments.

Investments in fund products Man uses capital to invest in our fund products as part of our ongoing business to build our product breadth and to trial investment research developments before we market the products to investors.
These seeding investments are generally held for less than one year.
Where Man is deemed not to control the fund, these are classified as investments in fund products.
Investments in fund products are classified at fair value through profit or loss, with movements in fair value of $55 million for the year ended 31 December 2016 2015: $14 million being recognised through income or gains on investments and other financial instruments.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade date.
Investments in fund products are not actively traded and the valuation at the fund level cannot be determined by reference to other available prices.
The fair values of investments in fund products are derived from the reported NAVs of each of the fund products, which in turn are based upon the value of the underlying assets held within each of the fund products and the anticipated redemption horizon of the fund product.
The valuation of theunderlying assets within each fund product is determined by external valuation service providers based on an agreed valuation policy and methodology.
Whilst these valuations are performed independently of Man, Man has established oversight procedures and due diligence processes to ensure that the NAVs reported by the external valuation service providers are reliable and appropriate.
Man makes adjustments to these NAVs where the anticipated redemption horizon, events or circumstances indicate that the NAVs are not reflective of fair value.
The fair value hierarchy offinancial assets is disclosed in Note 26.
Investments in fund products expose Man to market risk and therefore this process is subject to limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite.
The largest single investment in fund products is $186 million 2015: $170 million.
The market risk from seeding investments is modelled using a value at risk methodology using a 95% confidence interval and one-year time horizon.
The value at risk is estimated to be $72 million at 31 December 2016 2015: $55 million.
Fund investments for deferred compensation arrangements At 31 December 2016, investments in fund products included $75 million 2015: $71 million of fund products related to deferred compensation arrangements.
Employees are subject to mandatory deferral arrangements and as part of these arrangements employees can elect to have their deferral in a designated selection of Man fund products.
Changes in the fair value of the fund product awards are recognised over the relevant vesting period, which means the compensation expense changes based on the value of the fund products.
The associated fund product investments are held to offset this change in compensation during the vesting period and at vesting the value of the fund investment is delivered to the employee.
The fund product investments are recorded at fair value with any gains or losses during the vesting period recognised as income or gains on investments and other financial instruments in the Group income statement.

Consolidation of investments in funds Seed capital invested into funds may at times be significant, and therefore the fund may be deemed to be controlled by the Group Note 1.
The fund isconsolidated into the Groups results from the date control commences until it ceases.
In 2016, eleven 2015: nine investments in funds have met the control criteria and have therefore been consolidated Note 31, either classified as held for sale or consolidated on a line-by-line basis as detailed below.
Held for sale Where the Group acquires the controlling stake and actively markets the products to third-party investors, allowing the Group to redeem their share, anditis considered highly probable that it will relinquish control within one year from the date of initial investment, the investment in the controlled fund is classified as held for sale.
The seeded fund is recognised on the Group balance sheet as non-current assets and liabilities held for sale, with the interests of any other parties included within non-current liabilities held for sale.
Amounts recognised are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The non-current assets and liabilities held for sale are as follows: 31 December 31 December $m 2016 2015 Non-current assets held for sale 263 188 Non-current liabilities held for sale 132 69 Investments in fund products held for sale 131 119 Investments cease to be classified as held for sale when the fund is no longer controlled by the Group, at which time they are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Note 14.1.
Loss of control may eventuate through sale of the investment or a dilution in the Groups holding.
Ifa held for sale fund remains under the control of the Group for more than one year, and it is unlikely that the Group will reduce or no longer control its investment in the short-term, it will cease to be classified as held for sale and will be consolidated on a line-by-line basis as below.
Three investments in funds which were classified as held for sale in 2015 have been consolidated on a line-by-line basis for the year ending 31 December 2016 2015: two held for sale funds at 31 December 2014.
Line-by-line consolidation The investments relating to the six funds 2015: three which are controlled and are consolidated on a line-by-line basis are included within the Group balance sheet and income statement as follows: 31 December 31 December $m 2016 2015 Balance Sheet Cash and cash equivalents 37 21 Transferrable securities1 490 329 Trade and other payables 2 1 Net assets of line-by-line consolidated fund entities 525 349 Third-party interest in consolidated funds 240 136 Net investment held by Man 285 213 Income statement 2 Net gains losses on investments 45 16 3 Management fee expenses 9 4 3 Performance fee expenses 2 4 Other costs 3 Net gains losses of line-by-line consolidated fund entities 31 20 Third-party share of gains losses relating to interests in consolidated funds 15 9 Gains losses attributable to net investment held by Man 16 11 Notes: 1 Included within Investments in fund products and other investments.

Investments in fund products and other investments continued 14.3.
Loans to fund products Loans to fund products are short-term advances primarily to Man guaranteed products, which are made to assist with the financing of the leverage associated with the structured products.
The loans are repayable on demand and are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The average balance during the year is $33 million 2015: $75 million.
Loans to fund products have decreased compared to the prior year as guaranteed product FUM has decreased together with the associated leveraging.
The liquidity requirements of guaranteed products together with commitments to provide financial support Note 28 which give rise to loans to funds are subject to our routine liquidity stress testing and any liquidity requirements are met by available cash resources, or the syndicated revolving credit facility.
Loans to fund products expose Man to credit risk and therefore the credit decision making process is subject to limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite.
The carrying value represents Mans maximum exposure to this credit risk.
Loans are closely monitored against the assets held in the funds.
The largest single loan to a fund product at 31 December 2016 is $4 million 2015: $7 million.
Fund entities are not externally rated, but our internal modelling indicates that fund products have a probability of default that is equivalent to a credit rating of A.
Structured entities A structured entity is an entity designed so that its activities are not governed by way of voting rights, for example where contractual arrangements are the dominant factor in affecting an investors returns.
Man has evaluated all exposures and concluded that where Man holds an investment, loan, fees receivable, guarantee or commitment with an investment fund or a collateralised loan obligation, this represents an interest in a structured entity.
The activities of these entities are governed by investment management agreements or, in the case of a collateralised loan obligation, the indenture.
The key considerations in assessing whether the Group controls a structured entity, and therefore should be consolidated into the Groups financial statements, are outlined in Note 1.
Consolidated structured entities are detailed in Note 14.2.
Mans maximum exposure to loss from unconsolidated structured entities is the sum total of any investment held, fee receivables, accrued income, and loans to the fund entities, and is $420 million for the year ended 31 December 2016 2015: $450 million.

Feereceivables and accrued income represent management and performance fees from fund products and are received in cash when the funds net asset values are determined.
The majority of fees are deducted from the NAV of the respective funds by the independent administrators and therefore the credit risk of fee receivables is minimal.
No balances are overdue or delinquent at year end.

All provisions are current, other than onerous property lease contracts as outlined below, given the Group does not have the unconditional right to defer settlement.
The $3 million charge for onerous property lease contracts is included as an adjusting item as outlined in Note 2.
Provisions for onerous property leasecontracts represent the present value of the future lease payments that the Group is presently obliged to make under non-cancellable onerous operating lease contracts, less the future benefit expected to be generated from these, including sub-lease revenue where applicable.
The unexpired terms of the onerous leases range from two to 19 years, with all onerous property lease contracts therefore non-current.
Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the obligation arises, following communication of the formal plan.

Investments in associates Associates are entities in which Man holds an interest and over which it has significant influence but not control, and are accounted for using the equity method.
In assessing significant influence Man considers the investment held and its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee through its voting or other rights.
Further details of Mans equity investment holdings are included in Note 31.
Under the equity method associates are carried at cost plus or minus our share of cumulative post-acquisition movements in undistributed profits orlosses.
Gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interests in these entities.
An impairment assessment of the carrying value of associates is performed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, and any impairment is expensed in the Group income statement.
Mans investments in associates are as follows: Year ended 31 December 2016 Year ended 31 December 2015 Nephila Nephila $m Capital Ltd Other Total Capital Ltd Other Total At beginning of the year 28 2 30 28 2 30 Share of post-tax profit loss 3 1 2 3 3 Dividends received 1 1 3 3 At year end 30 1 31 28 2 30 Nephila Capital Limited is an alternative investment manager based in Bermuda specialising in the management of funds which underwrite natural catastrophe reinsurance and invest in insurance-linked securities and weather derivatives.

Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life, which for leasehold improvements is over the shorter of the life of the lease and the improvement up to 24 years and for equipment is between three and ten years.
Deferred compensation arrangements Man operates equity-settled share-based payment schemes as well as fund product based compensation arrangements.
Details of these schemes can be found in the Directors remuneration report on pages 64 to 89.
For compensation plans whereby deferred compensation is invested in fund products managed by Man, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the fund units is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, with a corresponding liability.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, which is remeasured at each reporting date, and equates to the fair value of the underlying fund products at settlement date.
During the year, $55 million 2015: $53 million relating to share-based payment and deferred fund product plans is included within compensation costs Note 5, consisting of share-based payments of $18 million 2015: $18 million and deferred fund product plans of $37 million 2015: $35 million.
The unamortised deferred compensation at year end is $43 million 2015: $49 million and has a weighted average remaining vesting period of 1.9 years 2015: 2.1 years.

Deferred compensation arrangements continued 20.1 Employee Trusts The Employee Trusts have the obligation to deliver shares, options and fund product based payments which have been granted to employees.
Mancontributed funds, in order for the Trusts to meet their current period obligations, of $38 million 2015: $37 million.
The Employee Trusts are fully consolidated into Man and shares held are treated as treasury shares for EPS purposes Note 9.
The shares held by theEmployee Trusts are deducted from Tier 1 Capital Note 21.
The Employee Trusts are controlled by independent trustees and their assets are held separately from those of Man.
At 31 December 2016, the net assets of the Employee Trusts amounted to $69 million 2015: $80 million.
These assets include 19,614,073 2015: 22,077,638 ordinary shares in the Company, $10 million notional value options over Man shares 2015: $11 million, and $24million of fund units 2015: $29 million to deliver against the future obligations.
The shares are recorded at cost and shown as a deduction from shareholders funds.

20.2 Share-based payments In respect of equity-settled share-based payment schemes, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the share awards and options granted is recognised as an expense, with the corresponding credit being recognised in equity.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awards and options at grant date.
The fair value of the share awards and options granted in exchange for employee services is calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model that takes into account the effect of both financial and demographic assumptions.
Forfeiture and early vesting are based on historical observable data.
Changes to the original estimates, ifany, are included in the Group income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Share options The fair values of share options granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: Sharesave share option schemes Grant date 15 09 2016 Weighted average share price at grant date $ 1.16 1.5 Weighted average exercise price at grant date $ 0.90 1.2 Share options granted in the period 3,589,100 Vesting period years 35 Expected share price volatility % 45 Dividend yield % 6 Risk-free rate % 0.2 Expected option life years 3.3 Number of options assumed to vest 2,732,645 Average fair value per option granted $ 0.4 The expected share price volatility is based on historical volatility over the past ten years.

Capital management Investor confidence is an important element in the sustainability of our business.
That confidence comes, in part, from the strength of our capital base.
Man has maintained significant surplus capital and available liquidity throughout the recent periods of market volatility.
Details of the Groups syndicated revolving loan facility, which provides additional liquidity, are provided in Note 13.
This capital has given Man flexibility to support our investors, intermediaries and financial partners, and to allow them to make informed decisions regarding their investment exposures.
This confidence gives ourbusiness credibility and sustainability.
We have a conservative capital and liquidity framework which allows us to invest in the growth of our business.
We utilise capital to support the operation of the investment management process and the launch of new fund products.
We view this as a competitive advantage which allows us to directly align our interests with those of investors and intermediaries.
Man monitors its capital requirements through continuous review of its regulatory and economic capital, including monthly reporting to the RiskandFinance Committee and the Board.
Man Group plcs distributable reserves are $1.8 billion 2015: $1.9 billion before payment of the proposed final dividend Note 10.
Further details of the Groups regulatory capital position are included in the Chief Financial Officers review onpage 35.
Mans dividend policy is that we will pay out at least 100% of adjusted net management fee earnings per share in each financial year by way of ordinary dividend.
In addition, Man expects to generate significant surplus capital over time, primarily from net performance fee earnings.
Available capital surpluses will be distributed to shareholders over time, by way of higher dividend payments and or share repurchases, while maintaining a prudent balance sheet, after taking into account required capital including liabilities for future earn-out payments and potential strategic opportunities.
Further details are provided within the Chief Financial Officers Review on page 35.
Share capital and capital reserves Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
Own shares held through the Employee Trusts are recorded at cost, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of tax, and are deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are transferred to employees or sold.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.

Pension Man operates 12 2015: 12 defined contribution plans and two 2015: two funded defined benefit plans.
Defined contribution plans Man pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
Man has no further payment obligation once the contributions have been paid.
Defined contribution pension costs totalled $10 million for the year to 31 December 2016 2015: $9 million and are recognised as pension costs in the Group income statement when they are due.
Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan creates a financial obligation to provide funding to the pension plan to provide a retired employee with pension benefits usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
As with the vast majority of similar arrangements, Man ultimately underwrites the risks related to the defined benefit plans.
These risks include investment risks and demographic risks, such as members living longer than expected.
The two defined benefit plans operated are the Man Group plc Pension Fund in the UK the UK Plan and the Man Group Pension Plan in Switzerland theSwiss Plan.
At 31 December 2016, the UK plan comprised 93% 31 December 2015: 91% of the Groups total defined benefit pension obligations.
Man Group plc Annual Report 2016 125 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements continued 22.
Pension continued The UK Plan is approved by HMRC for tax purposes, and is operated separately from Man and managed by independent trustees.
The trustees are responsible for payment of the benefits and management of the UK Plans assets.
Under UK regulations, Man and the trustees of the UK Plan are required to agree a funding strategy and contribution schedule for the UK Plan.
In order to maintain flexibility with regards to the funding of the UK Plan, Man set up the Man Group Reservoir Trust the Reservoir Trust in 2010.
Man contributed $76 million 50 million of assets to the Reservoir Trust on 31 March 2010 and has committed to ensure the Reservoir Trust value remains at least 69 million from 1 April 2013 or at the level of the funding deficit in the UK Plan, if lower.
The Reservoir Trust gives the pension trustees comfort that Man can fund a deficit at 31 December 2017 and in the event that the UK Plan is fully funded, allows Man to recover the assets so that the UK Plan is not over funded.
The Reservoir Trust is treated as an asset of the UK plan as: 1 the Reservoir Trust is legally separate from Man and exists solely to fund employee benefits: 2 the assets of the Reservoir Trust are passed to the UK Plan in the event of any default or insolvency situation, such that they are not available to Mans creditors: and 3 the funding position of the UK Plan is in deficit.
The latest funding valuation of the UK Plan was carried out by independent qualified actuaries as at 31 December 2014 and indicated a deficit of 11million, after including 59 million of assets in the Reservoir Trust.
To remove the funding deficit, Man agreed to make a cash payment of 11.8 million to the UK Plan during 2015 along with a further payment in March 2018 of up to 69.0 million from the Reservoir Trust to cover any remaining funding deficit.
Cash contributions of 2.3 million were made to the UK Plan in the year to 31 December 2016 all In respect of top-up payments to the Reservoir Trust in line with the requirements of the Reservoir Trust.
If the contributions currently agreed are insufficient to pay the benefits due, Man will need to make further contributions.
For the UK Plan, the Group has concluded that it has no requirement to adjust the balance sheet to recognise either a current surplus or a minimumfunding requirement on the basis that the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of a current or projected future surplus at some pointin the future.
For the Swiss Plan, there is a small asset restriction at the 2016 year end.
The Swiss Plan holds some of its assets in an employer contribution reserve, which can be used to reduce the Groups future contributions into the plan.
As the employer contribution reserve is less than the measured surplus as at 31 December 2016, the surplus has been restricted to the value of the employer contribution reserve.
The UK Plan was closed to new members in May 1999, and to future accrual in May 2011.
Employed members of the UK Plan retain enhanced benefits, including a link to salary, on their accrued benefits in the UK Plan.
Future benefits are provided via a defined contribution plan.
In Switzerland, the Group operates a retirement foundation with assets which are held separately from the Group.
This foundation covers the majority of employees in Switzerland and provides benefits on a cash balance basis.
Each employee has a retirement account to which the employee and the Group make contributions at rates set out in the plan rules based on a percentage of salary.
Every year the pension fund commission composed of employer and employee representatives decides the level of interest, ifany, to apply to retirement accounts based on their agreed policy.
At retirement an employee can take their retirement account as a lump sum or have this paid as a pension.
The amounts recognised in the Group balance sheet are determined as follows: 31 December 31 December $m 2016 2015 Present value of funded obligations 426 422 Fair value of plan assets 455 471 Surplus 29 49 Amount not recognised due to asset ceiling Swiss Plan see above 2 1 Net pension asset in the Group balance sheet at year end 27 48 The decrease in the net pension asset from 31 December 2015 to 31 December 2016 Is driven by the UK plan, largely as a result of the significant decrease in the discount rate assumption due to the large fall in corporate bond yields over the year, partially offset by assets performing above the liability growth rate discount rate and the top-up payments made to the Reservoir Trust.
Our economic capital model includes capital in respect of a possible deficit in the pension plans.

These mortality tables are assumed to be projected by year of birth with allowance for future improvements in longevity in line with the 2015 CMI projections with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% p. a. for males and females.
At 31 December 2016, mortality rates in the Swiss Plan were updated to be in line with the Swiss BVG 2015 generational tables 2015: in line with the Swiss BVG 2010 generational tables.
Illustrative life expectancies are set out in the table below the UK Plan life expectancies are based on the S2NA tables.

Pension continued The assets held by the two plans as at 31 December 2016 are as follows: UK Plan Swiss Plan $m % $m % Swiss equities 4 10 Non-Swiss equities 6 17 Index-linked government bonds 40 10 Absolute return bonds 43 10 Swiss bonds 12 33 Non-Swiss bonds 5 14 Property 6 16 Hedge funds 1 3 LDI 97 23 Diversified growth funds 95 23 Cash 63 15 1 3 Other 2 4 Reservoir Trust fund of hedge funds 80 19 Total assets 418 100 37 100 The plans do not invest directly in property occupied by Man or in Mans own transferable financial securities.
The UK Plans investment strategy is broadly split into growth and matching portfolios.
The matching portfolio is invested primarily in government and corporate bonds the latter through the Absolute return bonds holding, and LDI funds.
These are primarily intended to match the movement in the UK Plans funding liabilities, and therefore remove most of the interest rate risk and some of the inflation rate risk on a Technical Provisions basis.
As the Swiss Plan is essentially a defined contribution plan with guarantees, the assets held aim to be at least as much as the total of the member account balances at any point in time.
Member account balances cannot reduce, but interest is only applied to the account balances when sufficient surplus assets are available.
As such there is no specific asset liability matching strategy in place, but if the liabilities the sum of the member account balances ever exceed the value of the assets, the Company will consider how to remove a deficit as quickly as possible.
Segmental analysis The criteria for identifying an operating segment is that it is a component of Man whose results are regularly reviewed by the Board and the Executive Committee to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance.
Management information regarding revenues, gross management fee margins, investment performance and distribution costs relevant to the operation of the investment managers, products and the investor base are reviewed by the Board and the Executive Committee.
A centralised shared infrastructure for operations, product structuring, distribution and support functions for each of the four investment managers which Man incorporates AHL, GLG, FRM and Numeric means that operating costs are not allocated to constituent parts of the investment management business.
As a result, performance is assessed, resources are allocated and other strategic and financial management decisions are determined by the Board and the Executive Committee on the basis of the investment management business of Man as a whole.
Accordingly, we operate and report as a single segment investment management business, together with relevant information regarding FUM flows, gross margins and distribution costs, to allow for analysis of the direct contribution of products and the respective investor base.

Foreign currencies The majority of revenues, assets, liabilities and financing are denominated in USD and therefore Mans presentation currency is USD.
For consolidated entities with a USD functional currency, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at each balancesheet date rate.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at the spot rate at the date of the transaction or, if appropriate, the average rate for the month in which the transaction occurs.
Resulting exchange differences are recognised in the Group income statement.
For consolidated entities that have a functional currency other than USD, the assets and liabilities are translated into USD at the balance sheet date rate.
Income and expenses are translated at the average rate for the period in which the transactions occur.
Resulting exchange differences are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Fair value of financial assets liabilities Man discloses the fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities using three levels, as follows: Level 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities can be analysed as follows: 31 December 2016 31 December 2015 $m Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets held at fair value: Investments in fund products and other investments Note 14 3 207 68 278 4 162 62 228 Investments in line-by-line consolidated funds Note 14 490 490 329 329 Derivative financial instruments Note 15 2 2 2 2 3 699 68 770 4 493 62 559 Financial liabilities held at fair value: Derivative financial instruments Note 16 22 22 8 8 Contingent consideration Note 16 161 161 206 206 22 161 183 8 206 214 During the year, there were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances that affected the fair value of Mans financial assets andno significant transfers of financial assets or liabilities held at fair value between categories.
For investments in fund products, Level 2 investments comprise holdings primarily in unlisted, open-ended, active and liquid funds, such as seeding investments, which have daily or weekly pricing derived from third-party information.
A transfer into Level 3 would be deemed to occur where the level of prolonged activity, as evidenced by subscriptions and redemptions, is deemed insufficient to support a Level 2 classification.
This, as well as other factors such as a deterioration of liquidity in the underlying investments, would result in a Level 3 classification.
The material holdings within this category are priced on a recurring basis based on information supplied by thirdparties without adjustment.
Liquidity premium adjustments of $1 million 2015: $2 million have been applied to gated, suspended, side-pocketed or otherwise illiquid Level 3 investments.
The range of liquidity premium adjustments is from 12% to 33% based on the expected timeframe for exit, with a larger liquidity adjustment applied where the exit is further in the future.
Reasonable changes in the liquidity premium assumptions would not have a significant impact on the fair value.

Fair value of financial assets liabilities continued The fair values of non-current assets and liabilities held for sale Note 14.2 are equal to the carrying values of $263 million 2015: $188 million and $132 million respectively 2015: $69 million, and would be classified within Level 2.
In 2015, non-current assets and liabilities held for sale would have been classified as Level 2 $108 million and Level 3 $11 million.
The fair value of borrowings Note 13 is $157 million 2015: $157 million and would have been classified as Level 1.
The basis of measuring the fair value of Level 3 investments is outlined in Note 14.1.
The movements in Level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value are as follows: Year ended 31December 2016 Year ended 31December 2015 Financial assets Financial Financial liabilities at fair value liabilities at fair Financial assets at at fair value through profit value through fair value through through profit $m or loss profit or loss profit or loss or loss Level 3 financial assets liabilities held at fair value At beginning of the year 62 206 42 145 Assets reclassified from held for sale 11 Purchases 8 25 23 Total gains in the Group statement of comprehensive income 1 20 9 79 Profit loss included in income statement 1 20 9 79 Included in other comprehensive income Sales or settlements 14 25 14 41 At year end 68 161 62 206 Total gains losses for the year included in the Group statement of comprehensive income for assets liabilities held at year end 1 20 9 79 The financial liabilities in Level 3 primarily relate to the contingent consideration payable at 31 December 2016 to the former owners of Numeric $150million, with the remaining $11 million relating to contingent consideration for other smaller acquisitions.
In 2015, these largely related to the contingent consideration payable in relation to the Numeric and FRM acquisitions.

The call and put option structure means that it is virtually certain that Man will elect to, or be obliged to, purchase the interests held by Numeric management at five call option or five and a half put option years post-closing 5 September 2014.
The maximum aggregate amount payable by Man in respect of the option consideration is capped at $275 million.
The fair values are based on discounted cash flow calculations, which represent the expected future profits of each business as per the earn-out arrangements.
The fair values are determined using a combination of inputs, such as weighted average cost of capital, net management fee margins, performance, operating margins and the growth in FUM, as applicable.
The post-tax discount rates applied are 11% for management fees and 17% for performance fees.
The most significant inputs into the valuations at 31 December 2016 are as follows: Numeric Weighted average net management fee margin over the remaining earn-out period 0.4% Compound average annualised growth in FUM over the remaining earn-out period 9% A 0.1% increase decrease in the weighted average net management fee margin would result in a $59 million increase decrease in the contingent consideration creditor at 31 December 2016.
A 1% increase decrease in the compound average annualised growth in FUM over the remaining earn-out period would result in a $5 million increase decrease in the contingent consideration creditor at 31 December 2016.
Increases decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration creditor would have a corresponding expense gain in the Group income statement.

The commitment has now expired.
Post balance sheet events On 1 January 2017, the Board completed the acquisition of Aalto Invest Holding AG Aalto, with an estimated acquisition fair value of approximately $78million.
Aalto is a US and Europe-based real asset focused investment manager with $1.8 billion of funds under management at 1 January 2017.
Theestimated acquisition fair value largely represents goodwill in the acquired business, and also includes other acquired intangible assets such as investment management agreements.
The acquisition consideration is structured to align Aaltos interests with those of Man, and comprises an upfront payment of $25 million and four earn-out payments.
The earn-out payments are dependent on levels of run rate management fees measured following one, four, six and eight years from completion, and are capped at $207 million in aggregate.

Mans participation in the profits of Nephila is governed by the share class rights and therefore does not relate proportionately to the ownership interest held.
Man considers that this equity interest, Mans ability to veto Nephilas annual business plan, and the presence of a Man member on the Nephila board of directors provides Man with the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions, and equates to significant influence.
