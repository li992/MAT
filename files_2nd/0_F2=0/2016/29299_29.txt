INCOME TAX CONTINUED The total tax charge for the year differs from that resulting from applying the standard rate of corporate tax in the UK at 31 December 2016 of 20.0% 31 December 2015: 20.0%.
Due to the effect of Other items presented of the Consolidated Income Statement and their impact on a Group blend rate of tax, the reconciliation of total income tax expenses has been presented against the UK standard rate of tax, reflecting the tax residency of SIG plc.
The differences are explained in the following reconciliation: 2016 2015 m % m % Loss profit on ordinary activities before tax 106.3 51.3 Tax at 20.0% 2015: 20.0% thereon 21.3 20.0 10.3 20.0 Factors affecting the income tax expense for the year: non-deductible and non-taxable items 3.4 3.2 4.8 9.4 impairment charges 25.6 24.1 losses arising in the year not recognised for deferred tax purposes 1.4 1.3 losses utilised not previously recognised 0.3 0.6 other adjustments in respect of previous years 1.1 1.0 1.4 2.7 effect of overseas tax rates 4.5 4.2 2.4 4.7 effect of change in rate on deferred tax 0.2 0.2 0.8 1.6 Total income tax expense 12.3 11.6 15.0 29.2 The effective tax rate for the Group on the total loss before tax of 106.3m is negative 11.6% 2015: positive 29.2%.
The effective tax charge for the Group on profit before tax before Other items of 77.5m is 25.2% 2015: 24.2%, which comprises a tax charge of 25.9% 2015: 25.0% in respect of current year profits and a tax credit of 0.7% 2015: 0.8% in respect of prior years.
The current tax charge in the UK is minimal due to the use of 20.4m of brought forward non-trade tax losses.
There is a corresponding tax charge within the current year deferred tax movement relating to the utilisation of these losses.
The factors that will affect the Group's future total tax charge as a percentage of underlying profits are: the mix of profits between the UK and overseas: in particular, France Germany Belgium the Netherlands corporate tax rates greater than the rate in the UK and Ireland Poland corporate tax rates less than the rate in the UK.
If the proportion of profits from these jurisdictions changes, this could result in a higher or lower Group tax charge: the impact of non-deductible expenditure and non-taxable income: agreement of open tax computations with the respective tax authorities: and the recognition or utilisation with corresponding reduction in cash tax payments of unrecognised deferred tax assets see Note 23.
In addition to the amounts charged to the Consolidated Income Statement, the following amounts in relation to taxes have been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income with the exception of deferred tax on share options which has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
2016 2015 m m Deferred tax movement associated with remeasurement of defined benefit pension liabilities 2.3 0.2 Deferred tax on share options 0.6 0.1 Tax credit charge on exchange and fair value movements arising on borrowings and derivative financial instruments 6.3 1.5 Effect of change in rate on deferred tax 0.5 0.7 Total 7.5 2.5 These items will not subsequently be reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement.

The Directors have proposed a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2016 of 1.83p per ordinary share 2015: 2.91p.
The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
No dividends have been paid between 31 December 2016 and the date of signing the Accounts.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group had two share-based payment schemes in existence during the year ended 31 December 2016 2015: three.
The Group recognised a total credit of 0.3m 2015: charge of 0.1m in the year relating to share-based payment transactions issued after 7 November 2002 with a corresponding entry to the share option reserve.
There were no options granted during the year and therefore the weighted average fair value of each option granted in the year was nil p 2015: 163p.
Details of each of the schemes are provided below.
a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the existing LTIP policy, Executive Directors can be awarded an annual grant of nil paid share options up to a maximum value of 150% of base salary.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP continued There were no LTIP awards in 2016.
The criteria and vesting conditions of the previous LTIP options are as follows: 2015 Awards 2014 Award EPS ROCE EPS ROCE Weighting of criteria 33% 67% 33% 67% Vesting Conditions: Does not vest 38p 11.0% 35p 9.2% Vests proportionately 38p - 48p 11.0% - 14.0% 35p - 45p 9.2% - 13.0% Vests in full 48p 14.0% 45p 13.0% Proportion that vests at entry level 25% 0% 25% 0% Exercise period 310 years 310 years The right to exercise options terminates upon the employee ceasing to hold office with the Group, subject to certain exceptions and the discretion of the Board.
Awards have also been made annually since 2011 through a shadow Cash LTIP scheme that requires the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the share appreciation rights to the employee at the date of exercise.
This scheme has exactly the same conditions and vesting criteria as the LTIP, the difference being that the award is settled in the cash value of the equity in the event of the options being exercised, rather than through the issue of shares.
This scheme has been accounted for in the same way as the equity-settled scheme, with the exception that the liability is recognised within accruals as opposed to equity.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP continued No options were granted during the year and so the weighted average fair value of LTIP options granted during the year was nil p. The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years.
The expected percentage of total options exercised is based on the Directors' best estimate for the effects of behavioural considerations.
b Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP is offered to UK employees.
The SIP is an HM Revenue & Customs approved scheme and operates by inviting participants, including Executive Directors, to purchase shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner on a monthly basis.
The Company gives one matching share for each share purchased by the employee up to a maximum of 20 each month.
No performance criteria are attached to these matching shares, other than to avoid forfeiture the participants must remain within the plan for a minimum of two years.
In 2016, 167,546 2015: 108,120 matching shares were granted during the year.
Given the nature of the scheme, the fair value of the matching shares equates to the cost of the Company acquiring these shares.
Included within plant and machinery additions are assets in the course of construction of 0.2m 2015: 8.6m.
Of the 4.1m impairment charges, 0.3m relates to the cessation of the UK eCommerce project, 3.6m relates to the agreed sale of the Group's Carpet & Flooring business and 0.2m relates to the agreed sale, subject to contract, of the Drywall Qatar business.
"DIVESTMENTS AND EXIT OF NON-CORE BUSINESSES EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE The Group has recognised a total charge of 40.1m in respect of ""profits and losses on agreed sale or closure of non-core businesses and associated impairment charges"" within Other items of the Consolidated Income Statement."
Divestment of Carpet & Flooring At the 31 December 2016 the Group Board resolved to dispose of its UK specialist flooring distribution operation, Carpet & Flooring.
On 17 February 2017 the disposal was agreed with Endless LLP, a UK based private equity investor, and it completed on 28 February 2017.

The Group currently has sixteen CGUs.
Summary analysis The recoverable amounts of goodwill in respect of all CGUs are fully supported by the value in use calculations in the year and are as follows: 2016 2015 m m UK Distribution 102.5 98.1 UK Exteriors 112.8 110.6 Larivire 68.7 144.7 Other CGUs 68.7 84.1 Total goodwill 352.7 437.5 Impairment review process The Group tests goodwill and the associated intangible assets and property, plant and equipment of CGUs annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that an impairment may be required.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these calculations are those regarding discount rates, sales and operating profit growth rates.
These assumptions have been revised in the year in light of the current economic environment.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money for the Group.
In respect of the other assumptions, external data and management's best estimates are applied.
For the majority of CGUs, the Group performs goodwill impairment reviews by forecasting cash flows based upon the following year's budget, which anticipates sales growth, and a projection of sales and cash flows based upon industry growth expectations 0%-4% over a further period of four years.
Where detailed five year forecasts for a CGU have been prepared and approved by the Board, which can include higher growth rates or varied results reflecting specific economic factors, these are used in preparing cash flow forecasts for impairment review purposes.
The forecasts used in the annual impairment reviews have been prepared taking into account current economic conditions.
After this period, the sales growth rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are no more than 1% and operating profit growth no more than 4% in perpetuity.
The discount rates applied to all impairment reviews represent pre-tax rates.
GOODWILL CONTINUED Impairment review process continued Long-term operating Pre-tax profit growth discount rate % rate % UK 1.8 9.4 France 1.4 11.0 Germany and Austria 1.3 11.1 Poland 3.0 11.6 Ireland 3.5 9.4 Air Handling 1.5 11.1 Benelux 1.5 10.4 2016 impairment review results The most recent results of the impairment review process indicated that the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets associated with the Groups Larivire, Poland, Carpet & Flooring and Drywall Qatar CGUs were no longer supportable.
Increased market and macroeconomic uncertainty and challenging market conditions have led to the lowering of expectations in the future profitability of the Larivire CGU.
As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of 100.4m has been recognised as at 31 December 2016.
The carrying value of the CGU after the impairment charge is 97.5m.
Due to a change in the short-term forecast profitability of the Poland CGU, an impairment charge of 10.2m has been made to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in respect of this CGU to 1.2m.
There are no intangible assets in respect of this CGU.
On 17 February 2017 the Group agreed to the sale of the Carpet & Flooring business Note 11.
The market value of the sale indicated that at 31 December 2016 the carrying value of the goodwill relating to this CGU was impaired in full and, as a result, an impairment charge of 17.3m has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
In addition, the Group resolved to exit the Drywall Qatar business.
The Group has agreed, subject to contract, to dispose of its controlling interest in Drywall Qatar Note 11.
The intangible assets of 4.7m associated with this CGU have been impaired in full based on its revised value in use Note 13.
The carrying values of the Groups other CGUs remain supportable.
Sensitivity analysis A number of reasonably possible sensitivities have been performed on the Groups significant CGUs to highlight the changes in market conditions that would lead to verge of impairment.
The table below sets out the amount that the assumption would have to change by for there to be no headroom.
The Larivire CGU has been excluded from the 2016 sensitivity analysis on the basis that it has been impaired at the 2016 year end.
The results are as follows: 2016 Long-term operating Like-for-like market profit growth rate volume average % average % per per annum Discount rate % Gross margin % annum Headroom Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity Assumption Sensitivity UK Distribution 35.5m 0.2 1.9 9.4 1.8 24.7 0.4 1.8 1.5 UK Exteriors 133.1m 0.3 8.4 9.4 5.9 29.9 2.5 1.8 4.8 Germany and Austria 42.7m 0.1 3.6 11.1 7.0 26.9 1.1 1.3 4.6 The recoverable amount of goodwill in respect of Germany and Austria is 3.0m 2015: 2.6m.

GOODWILL CONTINUED The sensitivities noted above are the amounts by which the related assumption would have to vary before an impairment is indicated.
Revenue is the key assumption in the forecasts used in the goodwill impairment reviews, and therefore a 5% reduction in revenue has been determined as a reasonably possible change for the purposes of the disclosure requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
If a 5% reduction in revenue were to arise from that forecast in the goodwill impairment reviews, an impairment would arise in two CGUs, UK Distribution 71m and Germany and Austria 19m.
The Board has actively reviewed the forecasts associated with UK Distribution and Germany and Austria, noting the conservative assumptions used, the continued pattern of strong results in challenging economic environments and the outperformance of the markets in which they operate, and is satisfied that no impairments are necessary.
The current forecasts provide headroom of 35m in UK Distribution and 43m in Germany and Austria.
If a 5% reduction in revenue were to arise from that forecast in the goodwill impairment reviews, a further impairment of PLN 36m would arise in the Poland CGU and 59m in the Larivire CGU.

The 4.7m customer relationships impairment charges in the year relate to the Groups Drywall Qatar business.
At the December 2016 Group Board meeting, the Board resolved to exit the Drywall Qatar business and therefore the intangible assets associated with this business were impaired in full based on its revised value in use.
The computer software impairment charges in the year relate to the cessation of the UK eCommerce project.

Dependent upon future profits, a further 15.5m may be paid to the vendors of recent acquisitions who are employed by the Group.
These payments are contingent upon the vendors remaining within the business and, as required by IFRS 3, this will be treated as remuneration and will be charged to the Consolidated Income Statement as earned.
The related accrual of potential consideration in the year to 31 December 2016 is a credit of 0.3m 31 December 2015: charge of 10.2m.
Added to the 0.8m acquisition expenses is a 5.1m net decrease in contingent consideration based solely on a reassessment of post-acquisition performance of the acquired businesses: this has led to a net credit within Other items in the Consolidated Income Statement of 4.6m in respect of acquisitions see Note 2.

ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED In addition, 0.5m of deferred and contingent consideration not subject to the vendors remaining within the business has been recognised within goodwill and intangible assets in the year.
The Directors have made a provisional assessment of the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Any further adjustments arising will be accounted for in 2017.
These fair value adjustments may relate primarily to: a the review of the carrying value of all non-current assets to ensure that they accurately reflect their fair value b the alignment of valuation and provisioning methodologies to those adopted by the Group c an assessment of all provisions and payables to ensure they are accurately reflected in accordance with the Group's policies.
The fair value of financial assets includes trade receivables with a fair value of 6.0m and a gross contractual value of 6.1m.
The best estimate at the date of acquisition of the contractual cash flows not able to be collected is 0.1m.
Included within goodwill is the benefit of staff acquired as part of the business and strategic acquisition synergies which are specifically excluded in the identification of intangible assets on acquisition in accordance with the relevant accounting standards.
The goodwill of 10.8m arising from the acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Post-acquisition revenue and operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2016 for all 2016 acquisitions amounted to 34.8m and 1.3m respectively.
The Directors estimate that the combined pre-acquisition revenue and operating profit of the 2016 acquisitions for the period from 1 January 2016 to the acquisition dates was 4.9m and 0.3m respectively.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES CONTINUED Included within prepayments and accrued income is 56.1m 2015: 53.2m due in relation to supplier rebates where there is no right to offset against trade payable balances.
The average credit period on sale of goods and services for continuing operations on a constant currency basis is 45 days 2015: 45 days.
No interest is charged on receivables.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of 21.0m at 31 December 2016 2015: 18.8m.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
Included within the Group's trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 114.3m 2015: 138.6m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided, as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of these receivables is 35 days overdue 2015: 34 days.
Ageing analysis of trade receivables for which no provision for impairment has been made 2016 2015 m m Neither past due nor renegotiated 288.5 240.4 Renegotiated 2.7 1.0 Balances overdue which have no provision for impairment: 1-30 days 80.0 90.2 31-60 days 16.1 29.7 61-90 days 6.1 8.9 91-120 days 6.5 4.5 121-180 days 2.7 2.8 180 days 2.9 2.5 114.3 138.6 Total trade receivables for which no provision for impairment has been made 405.5 380.0 Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts 2016 2015 m m At 1 January 18.8 20.7 Utilised 6.8 6.9 Added on acquisition 0.1 0.5 Charged to the Consolidated Income Statement 5.0 6.0 Exchange differences 3.9 1.5 At 31 December 21.0 18.8 In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date and makes a provision for impairment accordingly.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The Directors therefore believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are trade receivables with a gross balance of 32.5m 2015: 25.7m and a provision for impairment of 21.0m 2015: 18.8m.
The provision for impairment represents the difference between the carrying amount of the specific trade receivable and the present value of the expected recoverable amount.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Trade receivable credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are set, reviewed and approved by operational management on a regular basis.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of typically small to medium sized customers, spread across a number of different market sectors and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer.

The private placement debt repayable in 2018 is denominated in Sterling.
The debt was swapped from fixed to floating rate debt using an interest rate swap.
The 24.3m of private placement debt repayable in 2026 that was denominated in US Dollar was swapped into Sterling through the use of cross-currency swaps.
The remainder of the private placement debt at 31 December 2016 is denominated in Euros.
The private placement debt in the table above is valued before application of the cross-currency swaps associated with the US Dollar denominated debt but after application of the interest rate swap associated with the Sterling denominated private placement debt, and therefore differs from the value of private placement debt of 198.4m as disclosed in Note 19 Financial Instruments.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of non-current liabilities approximates to their fair value, with the exception of the private placements notes, the fair value of which is disclosed in Note 19 on page 120.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED a Net investment hedges As at 31 December 2016 the Group held two 31 December 2015: zero cross-currency derivative financial instruments which receive fixed 20.9m and pay fixed 26.6m.
These derivative financial instruments were designated as the hedging instruments in the net investment hedge of the Groups Euro-denominated net assets.
The hedge relationships were fully effective and the fair value changes on those derivatives were recognised in equity hedging and translation reserve.
As at 31 December 2015 the Group held one cross-currency forward contract that was designated as a net investment hedge.

This is designated and effective as a net investment hedge of the Groups Euro denominated assets.
b Cash flow hedges With regard to cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in equity and is subsequently removed and included in the Consolidated Income Statement within Finance costs in the same period that the hedged item affects the Consolidated Income Statement.
The cash flow hedges described below are expected to impact upon both profit and loss and cash flow annually over the life of the hedging instrument and the related debt as interest falls due, and upon maturity of the debt and related hedging instrument.
As at 31 December 2016, the Group held two 31 December 2015: two cross-currency derivative financial instruments which swap fixed US Dollar denominated debt held in the UK into fixed Sterling denominated debt.
In addition, as at 31 December 2015, the Group held one cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instrument which swapped fixed rate US Dollar denominated debt into variable rate Sterling denominated debt.
These derivative financial instruments form a cash flow hedge as they fix the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
All of these derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
At 31 December 2016, the weighted average maturity date of these swaps is 9.6 years 2015: 0.8 years.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that details the effects on the Groups profit or loss and other equity of reasonably possible fluctuations in market rates.
This sensitivity analysis has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the following hypothetical variations in market rates on the fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities: i a 1% 100 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates.
ii a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against all other currencies to which the Group is exposed.
a Interest rate sensitivity The Group is currently exposed to Sterling, Euro and US Dollar interest rates.
The Group also has a minimal exposure to Polish Zloty interest rates.
In order to illustrate the Groups sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, the following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 100 basis point change in each respective interest rate.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit or loss and other equity.

DEFERRED TAX CONTINUED The deferred tax charge within the Consolidated Income Statement for 2016 includes a credit of 0.2m 2015: 0.8m arising from the change in domestic tax rates in the countries in which the Group operates.
Given current and forecast trading the Directors consider that recognition of the deferred tax assets above is appropriate.
The majority of the deferred tax asset associated with the retirement benefit obligations is in respect of the UK defined benefit scheme.
Payments against the deficit will be deductible for tax purposes on a paid basis and the Group expects to receive the tax benefit, therefore the associated deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Deferred tax has not been recognised on 13m of tax losses being carried forward on the basis that the realisation of their future economic benefit is uncertain.
The unrecognised potential deferred tax asset in relation to these tax losses is 2.8m 2015: 3.0m.
At the balance sheet date, no deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of 21m 2015: 22m relating to undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

GUARANTEES AND OTHER FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS CONTINUED c Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes, six 2015: six of which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable salary.
Of these schemes, one 2015: one has assets held in a separate trustee administered fund and five 2015: five are overseas book reserve schemes.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes, all of which are independently managed.
The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme.
The trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
In the Netherlands, the Company participates in the industry-wide pension plan for the construction materials industry BPF HiBiN.
The pension plan classifies as a multi-employer defined benefit scheme under IAS 19, but is recognised in the Accounts as a defined contribution scheme since the pension fund is not able to provide sufficient information to allow SIG's share of the assets and liabilities to be separately identified.
Therefore, the Group's annual pension expense for this scheme is equal to the required contribution each year.
The coverage ratio of the multi-employer union plan decreased to 97.6% as at 31 December 2016 2015: 105.3%.
No change was made to the pension premium percentage of 22.2% 2015: 22.2%.
The coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the funds assets by the total sum of pension liabilities and is based upon market interest rates.
The Group's total pension charge for the year including amounts charged to interest was 8.8m 2015: 7.8m, of which a charge of 2.5m 2015: 2.2m related to defined benefit pension schemes and 6.3m 2015: 5.6m related to defined contribution schemes.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations In accordance with IAS 19 the Group recognises all actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they arise in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The actuarial valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes are assessed by an independent actuary every three years who recommends the rate of contribution payable each year.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the SIG plc Retirement Benefits Plan, the UK scheme, was conducted at 31 December 2013 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 131.4m and their actuarial value covered 90% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The other five schemes are book reserve schemes whereby the sponsoring company does not hold any separate assets to fund the pension scheme but makes a reserve in its accounts.
Therefore, these schemes do not hold separate scheme assets.
The liabilities of the schemes are met by the sponsoring companies.
The schemes typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk.
The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members on death in service is reinsured by an external insurance company.
Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields: if the return on plan assets falls below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.
Currently the plan has relatively balanced investments in line with the Trustees Statement of Investment Principles between equity securities and debt instruments.
Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the trustees of the pension fund consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in growth assets to leverage the return generated by the fund.
Interest rate risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability but this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plans debt investments.
Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.
Salary risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants.
As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plans liability.
However, a pensionable salary cap was introduced from 1 July 2012 of 2.5% per annum.
Consolidated Income Statement charges The pension charge for the year including amounts charged to interest of 0.5m 2015: 0.7m relating to the defined benefit pension schemes was 2.5m 2015: 2.2m, including a curtailment loss of 0.9m.
On 30 June 2016 the UK defined benefit pension scheme was closed to future benefit accrual.
The change in assumptions associated with the closure resulted in a curtailment loss of 0.9m which has been charged within Other items in the Consolidated Income Statement.
In accordance with IAS 19, the charge for the defined benefit schemes has been calculated as the sum of the cost of benefits accruing in the year, the increase in the value of benefits already accrued and the expected return on assets.
The actuarial valuations described previously have been updated at 31 December 2016 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The UK defined benefit scheme is closed to new members and has an age profile that is rising.
The four overseas book reserve schemes remain open to new members.
GUARANTEES AND OTHER FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS CONTINUED c Pension schemes continued Consolidated Balance Sheet liability The balance sheet position in respect of the six defined benefit schemes can be summarised as follows 2016 2015 m m Pension liability before taxation 37.1 23.8 Related deferred tax asset 7.2 5.2 Pension liability after taxation 29.9 18.6 The actuarial loss of 12.5m 2015: gain of 1.9m for the year, together with the associated deferred tax credit of 2.3m 2015: charge of 0.2m and deferred tax charge of 0.5m 2015: 0.7m in respect of the change in the UK standard rate of corporation tax to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020, has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In addition a deferred tax charge of 0.2m 2015: 0.2m has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
A full reconciliation of the deferred tax movement is shown in Note 23.
The cumulative actuarial gains and losses gross of deferred tax from 2004 onwards recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income amounted to a loss of 50.2m 2015: 37.7m.
Of the above pension liability before taxation, 26.8m 2015: 15.4m relates to wholly or partly funded schemes and 10.3m 2015: 8.4m relates to the overseas unfunded schemes.
The movement in the pension liability before taxation in the year can be summarised as follows: 2016 2015 m m Pension liability at 1 January 23.8 28.7 Current service cost 1.1 1.5 Transfer to accruals 1.0 Payment of unfunded benefits 0.2 Contributions 3.1 3.5 Net finance cost 0.5 0.7 Curtailment loss 0.9 Actuarial loss gain 12.5 1.9 Effect of changes in exchange rates 1.4 0.5 Pension liability at 31 December 37.1 23.8 On 30 June 2016 the UK defined benefit pension scheme was closed to future benefit accrual.
However, the Group is contracted to pay contributions of 2.5m per annum to January 2019.
The principal assumptions used for the IAS 19 actuarial valuation of the schemes were: 2016 2015 2014 % % % Rate of increase in salaries n a 2.5 2.5 Rate of fixed increase of pensions in payment 1.7 1.7 1.6 Rate of increase of LPI pensions in payment 3.1 3.0 2.9 Discount rate 2.8 3.9 3.6 Inflation assumption 3.2 3.1 3.0 Upon closure of the UK defined benefit scheme to future benefit accrual the accrued benefits of active members ceased to be linked to their final salary and will instead revalue in deferment broadly in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index.

GUARANTEES AND OTHER FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS CONTINUED c Pension schemes continued Deferred pensions are revalued to retirement in line with the schemes' rules and statutory requirements, with the inflation assumption used for LPI revaluation in deferment.
The life expectancy for a male employee beyond the normal retirement age of 65 is 22.2 years 2015: 22.4 years.
The life expectancy on retirement at age 65 of a male employee currently aged 45 years is 23.5 years 2015: 24.2 years.
If the discount rate were to be increased decreased by 0.1%, this would decrease increase the Group's gross pension scheme deficit by 3.8m.
If the rate of inflation increased decreased by 0.1% this would increase decrease the Group's gross pension scheme deficit by 1.4m.
If the life expectancy for employees increased by one year the Group's gross pension scheme deficit would increase by 9.5m.
If the life expectancy for employees decreased by one year the Groups gross pension scheme deficit would decrease by 9.1m.
The average duration of the defined benefit scheme obligation at 31 December 2016 is 20 years 2015: 18 years.
