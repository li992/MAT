NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2016 6 Taxation continued f Changes in UK tax rate The effective tax rate for the year was 20% following a reduction to the rate on 1 April 2015.
A further reduction to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020 have been substantively enacted.
UK temporary differences are measured at the rate at which they are expected to reverse.
New legislation will become effective in April 2017 which will restrict the use of brought forward losses in the UK.
This legislation is not substantively enacted.
It is anticipated this will not affect the ability to use recognised deferred tax assets but may affect the period over which the losses can be utilised.
g Franked investment income litigation Since 2003, the Group has been involved in litigation with HMRC in respect of various advance corporate tax payments and corporate tax paid on certain foreign dividends which, in its view, were levied by HMRC in breach of the Groups EU community law rights.
The most recent Court of Appeal judgment in the case was published in November 2016.
This judgment was broadly positive, but HMRC has sought leave to appeal.
The continuing complexity of the remaining case and uncertainty over the issues raised and in particular which points HMRC may seek to appeal means that it is not possible to predict the final outcome of the litigation with any reasonable degree of certainty.
A successful outcome could result in the Group being able to recognise additional deferred tax assets in the UK and receiving cash payments from HMRC.
GKN has previously received payments from HMRC in respect of the case, principally interest, which have been recognised as received.
In August 2015, the Group agreed a settlement of 12 million with HMRC in respect of the Foreign Income Dividends element of the claim.
This resulted in an interest receipt, net of restitutional and other charges, of 4 million.
