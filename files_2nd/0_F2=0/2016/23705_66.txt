Level 3 items principally comprise contingent consideration and put and call options associated with corporate transactions.
Following a review of external reporting requirements in this area, amounts in respect of contingent consideration at 31 March 2016 of US$7m 2015: US$11m have been included within the Level 3 analysis in this note and comparative information has been represented as appropriate.
The inputs used in determining valuations are a mix of earnings and asset valuations reflecting different contractual arrangements.
There would be no material effect on the amounts stated from any reasonably possible change in such inputs at 31 March 2016.
