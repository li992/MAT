The principal activity of the Company is that of an investment trust company within the meaning of Section 1158 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and its investment approach is detailed in the Strategic Report.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, which comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The annual financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with the AIC SORP for the financial statements of investment trust companies and venture capital trusts, except to any extent where it is not consistent with the requirements of IFRS.
Basis of preparation The functional currency of the Company is Pounds Sterling because this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.
The financial statements are also presented in Pounds Sterling rounded to the nearest thousands, except where otherwise indicated.
Going concern The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and on the basis that approval as an investment trust company will continue to be met.
The Directors have made an assessment of the Companys ability to continue as a going concern and are satisfied that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future being a period of 12 months from the date these financial statements were approved.
Furthermore, the Directors are not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Companys ability to continue as a going concern, having taken into account the liquidity of the Companys investment portfolio and the Companys financial position in respect of its cash flows, borrowing facilities and investment commitments of which there are none of significance.
Therefore, the financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
Segmental reporting The Directors are of the opinion that the Company is engaged in a single segment of business, being investment business.
The Company primarily invests in companies listed in the UK and other recognised international exchanges.
Accounting developments The accounting policies are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
The following accounting standards and their amendments were in issue at the period end but will not be in effect until after this financial year end.
The Directors are considering the impact these accounting standards will have on the financial statements.
International Financial Reporting Standards Effective date IFRS 7 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Disclosures 1 January 2018 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts in the Balance Sheet, the Statement of Comprehensive Income and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future period if the revision affects both current and future periods.
There were no significant accounting estimates or significant judgements in the current period.
53 British Empire Trust plc Company Summary IFC Annual Report 2016 Strategic Report 02 14 Investment Review 15 33 Governance 34 47 Financial Statements 48 79 Shareholder Information 80 IBC Investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Upon initial recognition, the investments held by the Company are designated at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value, which is taken to be their cost excluding expenses incidental to the acquisition which are written off in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, and allocated to capital at the time of acquisition.
When a purchase or sale is made under a contract, the terms of which require delivery within the time-frame of the relevant market, the investments concerned are recognised or derecognised on the trade date.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments are valued at fair value through profit or loss.
For listed investments this is deemed to be bid market prices or closing prices for Stock Exchange Electronic Trading Service quotes and crosses SETSqx.
Fair values for unquoted assets, or investments for which the market is inactive, are established by using various valuation techniques in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation the IPEV guidelines.
These may include recent arms length market transactions, the current fair value of another instrument which is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models.
Where there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, that technique is utilised.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated for such instruments, they are carried at cost subject to any provision for impairment.
Changes in the fair value of investments are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as a capital item.
On disposal, realised gains and losses are also recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as capital items.
All investments for which a fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy in note 16.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in currencies other than Pounds Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Items which are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the capital reserve or the revenue account depending on whether the gain or loss is capital or revenue in nature.
Changes in fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts are recognised as they arise in the capital column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalent are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts when applicable.
Other receivables and payables Trade receivables, trade payables and short-term borrowings are measured at amortised cost and approximate fair value.
Income Dividends received from UK registered companies are accounted for net of inputed tax credits.
Dividends from overseas companies are shown gross of any non-recoverable withholding taxes which are disclosed separately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Dividends receivable on quoted equity shares are taken to revenue on an ex-dividend basis.
Dividends receivable on equity shares where no ex-dividend date is quoted are brought into account when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Fixed returns on non-equity shares are recognised on a time-apportioned basis using the effective interest method.
Special dividends are taken to the revenue or capital account depending on their nature.
In deciding whether a dividend should be regarded as a capital or revenue receipt, the Board reviews all relevant information as to the reasons for the sources of the dividend on a case-by-case basis.
When the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend forgone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital column.
All other income is accounted on a time-apportioned accruals basis using the effective interest rate method and is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
54 British Empire Trust plc Annual Report 2016 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Expenses and finance costs All expenses are accounted on an accruals basis.
On the basis of the Boards expected long-term split of total returns in the form of capital and revenue returns of 70% and 30% respectively, the Company charges 70% of its management fee and finance costs to capital.
Expenses incurred directly in relation to arranging debt finance are amortised over the term of the finance.
Expenses incurred in buybacks of shares to be held in treasury are charged to the capital reserve through the Statement of Changes in Equity.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the net revenue for the year and takes into account taxation deferred or accelerated because of temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for accounting and taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of timing differences can be deducted.
In line with recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate the tax relief on expenses charged to capital is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses charged through the revenue account, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital account.
Dividends payable to shareholders Dividends to shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are paid or approved in general meetings and are taken to the Statement of Changes in Equity.
Dividends declared and approved by the Company after the Balance Sheet date have not been recognised as a liability of the Company at the Balance Sheet date.
Non-current liabilities: Debenture and Loan Notes The non-current liabilities are valued at amortised cost under the effective interest method.
Costs in relation to arranging the debt finance have been capitalised and are amortised over the term of the finance.
Hence, amortised cost is the par value less the amortised costs of issue.
The Euro Loan Note is shown at amortised cost with the exchange difference on the principal amounts to be repaid reflected.
Any gain or loss arising from exchange rate change is included in the capital reserves and shown in the capital column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Further details of the non-current liabilities are set out in notes 12 and 16.
Revenue reserves The revenue reserve represents the surplus of accumulated profits and is distributable by the way of dividends.
Capital reserve Capital reserve other The following are taken to this reserve: gains and losses on the disposal of investments: amortisation of issue expenses: costs of share buybacks: exchange difference of a capital nature: and expenses, together with the related taxation effect, allocated to this reserve in accordance with the above policies.
Capital reserve investment holding gains The following are taken to this reserve: increase and decrease in the valuation of investments held at the year end.
Merger reserve The merger reserve represents the share premium on shares issued on the acquisition of Selective Assets Trust plc on 13 October 1995.
Share premium The share premium account represents the accumulated premium paid for shares issued in previous periods above their nominal value less issue expenses.
This is a reserve forming part of the non-distributable reserves.
The following items are taken to this reserve: costs associated with the issue of equity: and premium on the issue of shares.
Investments in subsidiaries The subsidiary is not consolidated due to it being dormant in the year.
The investment in the subsidiary is stated at fair value.

57 British Empire Trust plc Company Summary IFC Annual Report 2016 Strategic Report 02 14 Investment Review 15 33 Governance 34 47 Financial Statements 48 79 Shareholder Information 80 IBC The tax assessed for the year differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom of 20%.
The differences are explained below: Year ended 30 September 2016 Year ended 30 September 2015 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Return on ordinary activities after interest payable but before appropriations 16,839 183,912 200,751 17,486 81,419 63,933 Theoretical tax at UK corporation tax rate of 20% 3,368 36,782 40,150 3,585 16,691 13,106 Effects of the non-taxable items: UK franked investment income 535 535 690 690 Tax-exempt overseas investment income 3,252 3,252 3,497 3,497 Other non-taxable income 93 93 7 7 Losses gains on investments, exchange gains on capital items and movement on fair value of derivative financial instruments 37,871 37,871 15,693 15,693 Excess management expenses carried forward 505 1,089 1,594 604 998 1,602 Expenses not deductible for tax Overseas tax not recoverable 1,068 1,579 511 1,218 1,579 2,797 Overseas tax recovered previously expensed 2,987 2,987 Overseas tax expensed as DTR 11 11 12 12 Accrued income taxable on receipt 7 7 7 7 Deferred tax 19 19 Tax recovery credit for the year 1,908 1,579 3,487 1,218 1,560 2,778 Tax deducted on receipt of capital on acquisition of Westgrund by Adler, subsequently returned.
At 30 September 2016, the Company had unrelieved management expenses of 48,565,000 30 September 2015: 40,457,000 that are available to offset future taxable revenue.
A deferred tax asset of 9,713,000 has not been recognised because the Company is not expected to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods in excess of the available deductible expenses and accordingly, the Company is unlikely to be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing surplus losses.
Deferred tax is not provided on capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments because the Company meets and intends to continue for the foreseeable future to meet the conditions for approval as an investment trust company.
Unrecognised tax losses The Company has a tax loss of 48,534,000 2015: 40,896,000 carried forward at the Balance Sheet date which is available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits.
A potential deferred tax asset of 9,707,000 2015: 8,179,000 based on 20% tax rate has not been recognised in respect of this tax loss as there is uncertainty over whether there will be sufficient future taxable profits against which this tax loss can be offset.

Financial instruments and capital disclosures Investment objective and policy The investment objective of the Company is to achieve capital growth through a focused portfolio of investments, particularly in companies whose share prices stand at a discount to estimated underlying net asset value.
The Companys investment objective and policy are detailed on page 36.
The Companys financial instruments comprise equity and fixed interest investments, cash balances, receivables, payables and borrowings.
The Company makes use of borrowings to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The risk of borrowings may be reduced by raising the level of cash balances or fixed interest investments held.
Risks The risks identified arising from the financial instruments are market risk which comprises market price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and credit and counterparty risk.
The Company may also enter into derivative transactions to manage risk.
The Board and Investment Manager consider and review the risks inherent in managing the Companys assets which are detailed below.
Market risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions by way of price movements, interest rate movements and exchange rate movements.
The Investment Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and these risks are monitored by the Investment Manager on a regular basis and the Board at quarterly meetings with the Investment Manager.
Market price risk Market price risk i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from currency risk or interest rate risk may affect the value of investments.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse price movements through detailed and continuing analysis with the objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
If the fair value of the Companys investments at the year end increased or decreased by 10%, then it would have had an impact on the Companys capital return and equity of 88,637,000 2015: 70,705,000.
Foreign currency The value of the Companys assets and the total return earned by the Companys shareholders can be significantly affected by foreign exchange rate movements as most of the Companys assets are denominated in currencies other than Pounds Sterling, the currency in which the Companys financial statements are prepared.

The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions.
The Company, generally, does not hold significant cash balances, with short-term borrowings being used when required.
The Debenture Stock and Loan Notes issued by the Company as a planned level of gearing, pay a fixed-rate of interest and are carried in the Companys Balance Sheet at amortised cost rather than at fair value.
Hence, movements in interest rates will not affect net asset values, as reported under the Companys accounting policies, but may have an impact on the Companys share price and discount premium.
The exposure at 30 September of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to floating interest rates.
At At 30 September 30 September 2016 2015 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and cash equivalents 13,799 6,649 If the above level of cash was maintained for a year, a 1% increase in LIBOR would increase the revenue return and net assets by 138,000 2015: 66,000.
Management proactively manages cash balances.
If there was a fall by 1% in LIBOR, it would potentially impact the Company by turning positive interest to negative interest.
The total effect would be a cost increase revenue reduction of 138,000.

As there is no publicly available price for the Companys Loan Notes, their fair market value has been derived by calculating the relative premium or discount of the loan versus the publicly available market price of the reference market instrument and exchange rates.
As this price is derived by model, using observable inputs, it would be categorised as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.
Valuation of financial instruments The Company measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant assets as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data for the asset or liability.
The tables below set out fair value measurements of financial instruments as at the year end, by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised.
