Risk adjuster The committee received input from the Groups Chief Risk Officer, endorsed by the Board Risk Committee, which confirmed that the Group had achieved its objectives within the risk policies and risk appetite limits established for the period.
However, the committee exercised its discretion in one important area in order to ensure that it maintained its overriding objective to align reward with performance.
The committee determined that it was appropriate to make a downward adjustment equal to 6% of the scorecard outcome of the 2014 LTIP, to take account of the time and cost overruns of the OMW UK Platform IT transformation project.
