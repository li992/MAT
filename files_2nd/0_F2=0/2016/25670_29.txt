John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2016 81 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2016 1 GENERAL INFORMATION The statutory and pro forma results of John Laing Group plc the Company or the Group are stated according to the basis of preparation described below.
The registered office of the Company is 1 Kingsway, London, WC2B 6AN.
The principal activity of the Company is the origination, investment in and management of international infrastructure projects.
Statutory and pro forma financial information is presented in pounds sterling and prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of preparation Statutory financial information for the year ended 31 December 2016 is presented in the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Group Statement of Changes in Equity alongside comparative pro forma and statutory financial information for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The comparative pro forma financial information was prepared on the basis that the restructuring associated with the Companys admission to listing in February 2015, as described in more detail in the Financial Review section of the 2015 Annual Report, had been in place throughout the year ended 31 December 2015.
Both the Group Balance Sheet at 31 December 2016 and at 31 December 2015 are presented on a statutory basis.
There is no difference in the statutory and pro forma Group Balance Sheet for 31 December 2015.
In the opinion of the Directors, presenting pro forma information for 2015 was necessary in order to give a true and fair view of the state of the Companys affairs for that year.
This is the last year for which pro forma financial information will be presented.
The financial statements have been prepared on an investment entity basis see note 2c and in accordance with the historical cost convention except for the revaluation of the investment portfolio and financial instruments that are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies.
b Adoption of new and revised standards The Group has adopted the following amendments to IFRS in the current year, none of which has had a material impact on the financial statements: Amendments resulting from the September 2014 Annual Improvements to IFRS Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures amendments regarding the consolidation exception Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements amendments regarding the accounting for acquisitions of an interest in joint operation Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Disclosure initiative Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets amendments regarding the clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, there are a number of standards and interpretations which are in issue but not yet effective and in some cases have not yet been adopted by the EU.

Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview 82 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2016 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED b Adoption of new and revised standards continued While the Group is still undertaking an assessment of the impact of the new standards, it is not anticipated that they will have a material impact on the Group with the exception that the adoption of IFRS 15 may lead to further disclosure within the financial statements.
IFRS 16 is not expected to have a significant impact as the Group does not have any material leases.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, when it becomes effective, will have an impact on the classification and disclosure of financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Group financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been applied consistently to each of the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
c Application of investment entity guidance The Company meets the definition of an investment entity set out in IFRS 10.
Investment entities are required to account for all investments in controlled entities, as well as investments in associates and joint ventures, at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, except for those directly-owned subsidiaries that provide investment related services or engage in permitted investment related activities with investees Service Companies.
Service Companies are consolidated rather than recorded at FVTPL.
For details of the subsidiaries that are consolidated, see note 13 to the Company financial statements.
d Going concern The Directors have reviewed the Groups financial projections and cash flow forecasts and believe, based on those projections and forecasts, that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Group on the going concern basis.
In arriving at their conclusion, the Directors took into account the Groups approach to liquidity and cash flow management and the availability of its 400.0 million corporate banking facilities committed until March 2020 and of its 50.0 million surety facilities committed until March 2018.
The Directors are of the opinion that, based on the Groups forecasts and projections and taking into account expected bidding activity and operational performance, the Group will be able to operate within its bank facilities and comply with the financial covenants therein for the foreseeable future.
In determining that the Group is a going concern, certain risks and uncertainties, some of which arise or increase as a result of the economic environment in some of the Groups markets, have been considered.
The Directors believe that the Group is adequately placed to manage these risks.
The most important risks and uncertainties identified and considered by the Directors are set out in the Principal Risks and Risk Management section.
In addition, the Group's policies for management of its exposure to financial risks, including liquidity, foreign exchange, credit, price and interest rate risks are set out in note 16. e Dividend income Dividend income from investments at FVTPL is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established provided that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Dividend income is recognised gross of withholding tax, if any, and only when approved and paid by the project company.
f Dividend payments Dividends on the Companys ordinary shares are recognised when they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer at the Companys discretion.
Accordingly, interim dividends are recognised when they are paid and final dividends are recognised when they are declared following approval by shareholders at the Companys AGM.
Dividends are recognised as an appropriation of shareholders funds.
g Net gain on investments at FVTPL Net gain on investments at FVTPL excludes dividend income referred to above.
Please refer to accounting policy i i for further detail.
John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2016 83 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2016 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED h Other income The Group earns income from the following sources: i Fees from asset management services Fees from asset management services to projects in which the Group invests and to external parties are recognised as the services are provided in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
When it is probable that the expected outcome over the life of a management services contract will result in a net outflow of economic benefits or overall loss, a provision is recognised immediately.
The provision is determined based on the net present value of the expected future cash inflows and outflows.
ii Recovery of bid costs on financial close Bid costs in respect of primary investments are charged to the Group Income Statement until such time as the Group is virtually certain that it will recover the costs.
Virtual certainty is generally achieved when an agreement is in place demonstrating that costs are fully recoverable even in the event of cancellation of a project.
From the point of virtual certainty, bid costs are held in the Group Balance Sheet as a debtor prior to achieving financial close.
On financial close, the Group recovers bid costs by charging a fee to the relevant project company in the investment portfolio.
Other income excludes the value of intra-group transactions and VAT and includes revenue derived from the provision of services by Service Companies to project companies which are held at FVTPL.
i Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the instrument expire or the asset is transferred and the transfer qualifies for derecognition in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities other than financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
i Financial assets All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at FVTPL, which are initially measured at fair value.
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets at FVTPL: held-to-maturity investments: available-for-sale financial assets: or loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
The financial assets that the Group holds are classified as financial assets at FVTPL and loans and receivables: Financial assets at FVTPL comprise the Groups investment in John Laing Holdco Limited through which the Group holds its investments which is valued based on the fair value of investments in project companies, the Groups investment in JLEN and other assets and liabilities of investment entity subsidiaries.
Investments in project companies and in JLEN are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at FVTPL.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments in project companies are measured on a combined basis at fair value principally using discounted cash flow methodology.
The investment in JLEN is valued at the quoted market price at the end of the period.
The Directors consider that the carrying value of other assets and liabilities held in investment entity subsidiaries approximates to their fair value, with the exception of derivatives which are measured in accordance with accounting policy i v. Changes in the fair value of the Groups investment in John Laing Holdco Limited are recognised within operating income in the Group Income Statement.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Loans and receivables are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets.
The Group's loans and receivables comprise 'trade and other receivables' and 'cash and cash equivalents' in the Group Balance Sheet.
Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview 84 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2016 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED i Financial instruments continued ii Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indications of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events which have occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss.
iii Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.
If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
iv Financial liabilities Interest-bearing bank loans and borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, being the proceeds received net of direct issue costs, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the Group Income Statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
v Derivative financial instruments The Group treats forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swap deals it enters into as derivative financial instruments at FVTPL.
Changes in the fair value of these instruments are taken through the Group Income Statement.
j Provisions Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required on settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole.
k Finance costs Finance costs relating to the corporate banking facilities, other than set-up costs, are recognised in the year in which they are incurred.
Set-up costs are recognised over the remaining facility term.
Finance costs also include the net interest cost on retirement benefit obligations and the unwinding of discounting of provisions.
John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2016 85 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2016 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED l Taxation The tax charge or credit represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Group Income Statement because it excludes both items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full for taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will arise to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Group Income Statement except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
m Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group subsidiary that is consolidated i. e. a Service Company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purposes of the financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group subsidiary are expressed in pounds sterling, the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the financial statements.
Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currency including investments measured at fair value are reported at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Any difference arising on the retranslation of these amounts is taken to the Group Income Statement with foreign exchange movements on investments measured at fair value recognised in operating income as part of net gain on investments at FVTPL.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
n Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Where a disposal group represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, it is treated as a discontinued operation.
The post-tax profit or loss of this discontinued operation together with the gain or loss recognised on its disposal is shown as a single amount on the face of the Group Income Statement, with all historical financial periods being presented on this basis.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount is recoverable through a sale rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as having been met only when the sale is highly probable, the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is completed within one year of the date of its classification.
o Retirement benefit costs The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements.
Its two defined benefit pension schemes are the John Laing Pension Fund JLPF and the John Laing Pension Plan, which are both closed to future accrual.
The Group also provides post-retirement medical benefits to certain former employees.
Payments to defined contribution pension arrangements are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For the defined benefit pension schemes and the post-retirement medical benefit scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined in accordance with IAS 19: Employee Benefits revised using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at least every three years.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the year in which they occur and are presented in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Curtailment gains arising from changes to members benefits are recognised in full in the Group Income Statement.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the Group Balance Sheet represent the present value of: i defined benefit scheme obligations as adjusted for unrecognised past service costs and reduced by the fair value of scheme assets, where any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service costs plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the schemes: and ii unfunded post-retirement medical benefits.
Net interest expense or income is recognised within finance costs.
Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview 86 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2016 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED p Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the Group Balance Sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
For the purposes of the Group Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short term deposits as defined above, net of bank overdrafts.
Deposits held with original maturities of greater than three months are shown as other financial assets.
q Leasing All leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
r Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments on the basis that they evidence a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all its liabilities.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are recognised in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds in the period in which the shares are issued.
s Employee benefit trust In June 2015, the Group established the John Laing Group Employee Benefit Trust EBT as described further in note 5.
The Group is deemed to have control of the EBT and it is therefore treated as a subsidiary and consolidated for the purposes of the accounts.
Any investment by the EBT in the parent companys shares is deducted from equity in the Group Balance Sheet as if such shares were treasury shares.
No investment was made in the year.
Other assets and liabilities of the EBT are recognised as assets and liabilities of the Group.
Any shares held by the EBT are excluded for the purposes of calculating earnings per share.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The key areas of the financial statements where the Group is required to make critical judgements and material accounting estimates are in respect of the fair value of investments and accounting for the Groups defined benefit pension liabilities.
Fair value of investments Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies The Company measures its investment in John Laing Holdco Limited at fair value.
Fair value is determined based on the fair value of investments in project companies and the Groups investment in JLEN together the Groups investment portfolio and other assets and liabilities of investment entity subsidiaries.
A valuation of the Groups investment portfolio is prepared on a consistent, principally discounted cash flow basis at 30 June and 31 December.
The valuation excluding the investment in JLEN assumes that forecast cash flows are received until maturity of the underlying assets.
The cash flows on which the discounted cash flow valuation is based are those forecast to be distributable to the Group at each balance sheet date, derived from detailed project financial models.
These incorporate a number of assumptions with respect to individual assets, including: dates for construction completion: value enhancements: the terms of project debt refinancing where applicable : the outcome of any disputes: the level of volume-based revenue: and, for renewable energy projects, future energy prices.
Value enhancements are only incorporated when the Group has sufficient evidence that they can be realised.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty A key source of estimation uncertainty in valuing the investment portfolio is the discount rate applied to forecast project cash flows.
A base case discount rate for an operational project is derived from secondary market information and other available data points.
The base case discount rate is then adjusted to reflect project-specific risks.
In addition, risk premia are added during the construction phase to reflect the additional risks throughout construction.
These premia reduce over time as the project progresses through its construction programme, reflecting the significant reduction in risk once the project reaches the operating stage.
The discount rates applied to investments at 31 December 2016 were in the range of 7.0% to 11.6% 31 December 2015 7.3% to 12.3%.
Further detail on key assumptions underpinning the valuation of the investments including sensitivities can be found in note 16.
As part of the valuation of the investment portfolio at 31 December 2016, the Group has valued its investments in New Royal Adelaide Hospital and in Manchester Waste VL Co.
This has involved making assumptions as to the outcome of the current situations relating to each investment, as described in the Chief Executive Officers Review on page 8.
Both situations are dependent on future events and therefore carry an element of uncertainty.
In the case of the investment in New Royal Adelaide Hospital, the main judgement underlying the Groups valuation is an assumption that the hospital reaches commercial acceptance in mid 2017.
In the case of Manchester Waste VL Co, the Groups valuation is based on the assumption that a resolution is reached with GMWDA which is commercially acceptable to Manchester Waste VL Co and which has a minimal impact on Manchester Waste TPS Co. John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2016 87 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2016 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Pension and other post-retirement liability accounting Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies The combined accounting deficit in the Groups defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical schemes at 31 December 2016 was 69.3 million 31 December 2015 46.2 million.
In determining the Groups defined benefit pension liability, consideration is also given to whether there is a minimum funding requirement under IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction which is in excess of the IAS 19 Employee Benefits liability.
If the minimum funding requirement is higher, an additional liability would need to be recognised.
Under the trust deed and rules of JLPF, the Group has an ultimate unconditional right to any surplus, accordingly the excess of the minimum funding requirement over the IAS 19 Employee Benefits liability has not been recognised as an additional liability.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The value of the pension deficit is highly dependent on key assumptions including price inflation, discount rate and life expectancy.
The assumptions applied at 31 December 2016 and the sensitivity of the pension liabilities to certain changes in these assumptions are illustrated in note 18.
3 OPERATING SEGMENTS Information is reported to the Group's Board the chief operating decision maker under IFRS 8 Operating Segments for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance based on the category of activities undertaken within the Group.
The principal categories of activity, and thus the reportable segments under IFRS 8 Operating Segments, are: Primary Investment, Secondary Investment and Asset Management.
The results included within each of the reportable segments comprise: Primary Investment costs and cost recoveries associated with originating, bidding for and winning greenfield infrastructure and renewable energy projects: investment returns from and growth in the value of the Primary Investment portfolio, net of associated costs.
Secondary Investment investment returns from and growth in the value of the Secondary Investment portfolio, net of associated costs.
Asset Management fee income and associated costs from investment management services in respect of both the Primary and Secondary Investment portfolios and in respect of JLIF's and JLEN's portfolios and the PPP assets in JLPFs portfolio plus fee income and associated costs from project management services.
The Board's primary measure of profitability for each segment is profit before tax.
The Board does not monitor on an ongoing basis the results of the Group on a geographical basis.

Awards are conditional on the relevant employee completing three years' service the vesting period.
The awards vest three years from the grant date, subject to the Group achieving a target share-based performance condition, total shareholder return 50% of the award, and a nonmarket based performance condition, NAV growth per share 50% of the award.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the awards in cash.
The movement in the number of shares awarded is as follows: Number of shares awarded 2016 2015 At 1 January 1,763,030 Granted 2,094,460 1,795,830 Lapsed 83,160 32,800 At 31 December 3,774,330 1,763,030 The weighted average fair value of awards granted during the year was 167.25 pence per share 2015 130.89p for the market-based performance condition, determined using the Stochastic valuation model, and 226.49 pence per share 2015 218.11p for the non-market based performance condition determined using the Black Scholes model.
The weighted average fair value of awards granted during the year from both models is 196.87 pence per share 2015 174.46p.
The significant inputs into the model were the weighted average share price of 226.5 pence 2015 219.5p at the grant date, expected volatility of 12.55% 2015 14.17%, expected dividend yield of 3.10% 2015 2.17%, an expected award life of three years and an annual risk-free interest rate of 0.4% 2015 0.68%.
The volatility measured at the standard deviation of continuously compounded share returns is based on statistical analysis of daily share prices over three years.
The total expense recognised in the Group Income Statement for awards granted under share-based incentive arrangements for the year ended 31 December 2016 was 2.0 million 2015 0.7 million.
Of the 3,774,330 outstanding awards 2015 1,763,030, none were exercisable at 31 December 2016 2015 nil.

Level 1 and Level 3 investments are fair valued in accordance with the policy and assumptions set out in note 2 i.
The investments at FVTPL include other assets and liabilities as shown in note 11.
Such other assets and liabilities are recorded at amortised cost which the Directors believe approximates to their fair value.
The tables in section a provide an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to their initial recognition at fair value.
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs to the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 during either year.
There were no transfers out of Level 3.
Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities An analysis of the movement between opening and closing balances of assets at FVTPL is given in note 11.

The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
For the parent company and its recourse subsidiaries, financial risks are managed by a central treasury operation which operates within Board approved policies.
The various types of financial risk are managed as follows: Market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk As at 31 December 2016 the Group held investments in 26 overseas projects 31 December 2015 18 overseas projects.
The Group's foreign currency exchange rate risk policy is to determine the total Group exposure to individual currencies: it may then enter into hedges against certain individual investments.
The Group's exposure to exchange rate risk on its investments is disclosed below.
In addition, the Group policy on managing foreign currency exchange rate risk is to cover significant transactional exposures arising from receipts and payments in foreign currencies, where appropriate and cost effective.
There were 21 forward currency contracts open as at 31 December 2016 31 December 2015 15.
The fair value of these contracts was a net asset of 3.5 million 31 December 2015 3.7 million liability and is included in investments at FVTPL.
At 31 December 2016, the Group's most significant currency exposure was to the Euro 31 December 2015 Euro.

Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Overview 98 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2016 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2016 16 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Market risk interest rate risk The Group's interest rate risk arises due to fluctuations in interest rates which impact on the value of returns from floating rate deposits and expose the Group to variability in interest payment cash flows on variable rate borrowings.
The Group has assessed its exposure to interest rate risk and considers that this exposure is low as its variable rate borrowings tend to be short term, its finance costs in relation to letters of credit issued under the corporate banking facilities are at a fixed rate and the interest earned on its cash and cash equivalents minimal.
The exposure of the Group's financial assets to interest rate risk is as follows: 31 December 2016 31 December 2015 Interest bearing Non-interest Interest bearing Non-interest Floating rate bearing Total Floating rate bearing Total million million million million million million Financial assets Investments at FVTPL 1,257.5 1,257.5 965.3 965.3 Trade and other receivables 7.0 7.0 8.1 8.1 Cash and cash equivalents 1.6 1.6 1.1 1.1 Financial assets exposed to interest rate risk 1,266.1 1,266.1 974.5 974.5 An analysis of the movement between opening and closing balances of investments at FVTPL is given in note 11.
Investments in project companies are principally valued on a discounted cash flow basis.
At 31 December 2016, the weighted average discount rate was 8.9% 31 December 2015 9.5%.
For investments in project companies, changing the discount rate used to value the underlying instruments would alter their fair value.
As at 31 December 2016 a 0.25% increase in the discount rate would reduce the fair value by 32.1 million 31 December 2015 26.1 million and a 0.25% reduction in the discount rate would increase the fair value by 33.6 million 31 December 2015 27.2 million.
The exposure of the Group's financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: 31 December 2016 31 December 2015 Interest-bearing Non-interest Interest-bearing Non-interest Fixed rate bearing Total Fixed rate bearing Total million million million million million million Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 161.4 161.4 14.9 14.9 Trade and other payables 13.0 13.0 17.6 17.6 Total financial liabilities 161.4 13.0 174.4 14.9 17.6 32.5 Market risk inflation risk The Group has limited direct exposure to inflation risk, but the fair value of investments is determined by future project revenue and costs which can be partly linked to inflation.
Sensitivity to inflation can be mitigated by the project company entering into inflation swaps.
Where PPP investments are positively correlated to inflation, an increase in inflation expectations will tend to increase the value of PPP investments.
However, an increase in inflation expectations would tend to increase JLPF's pension liabilities.
Based on a sample of seven of the larger PPP investments by value at 31 December 2016, a 0.25% increase in inflation is estimated to increase the value of PPP investments by c. 14 million and a 0.25% decrease in inflation is estimated to decrease the value of PPP investment by c. 13 million.
Certain of the underlying project companies incorporate some inflation hedging.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis and arises from a combination of the value and term to settlement of balances due and payable by counterparties for both financial and trade transactions.
In order to minimise credit risk, cash investments and derivative transactions are limited to financial institutions of a suitable credit quality and counterparties are carefully screened.
The Group's cash balances are invested in line with a policy approved by the Board, capped with regard to counter-party credit ratings.
A significant majority of the project companies in which the Group invests receive revenue from government departments, public sector or local authority clients and or directly from the public.
As a result, these projects tend not to be exposed to significant credit risk.
John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2016 99 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2016 16 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Price risk The Groups investments in PPP assets have limited direct exposure to price risk.
The fair value of many such project companies is dependent on the receipt of fixed fee income from government departments, public sector or local authority clients.
As a result, these projects tend not to be exposed to price risk.
The Group also holds investments in renewable energy projects whose fair value may vary with forecast energy prices to the extent they are not hedged through short to medium term fixed price purchase agreements with electricity suppliers, or do not benefit from governmental support mechanisms at fixed prices.
The Groups investment in JLEN is valued at its closing market share price.
Liquidity risk The Group adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management by maintaining sufficient cash and available committed facilities to meet its current and upcoming obligations.
The Group's liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows in major currencies and assessing the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.
Managing liquidity risk is helped by the relative predictability in both value and timing of cash flows to and from the project companies in which the Group invests.
Maturity of financial assets The maturity profile of the Group's financial assets excluding investments at FVTPL is as follows: 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 Less than Less than one year one year million million Trade and other receivables 7.0 8.1 Cash and cash equivalents 1.6 1.1 Financial assets excluding investments at FVTPL 8.6 9.2 Other than certain trade and other receivables, as detailed in note 12, none of the financial assets is either overdue or impaired.

The Group's capital structure comprises its equity as set out in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity and its net borrowings.
At 31 December 2016, the Group had committed corporate banking facilities of 400.0 million, expiring in March 2020, together with additional surety facilities of 50.0 million, backed by committed liquidity facilities, expiring in March 2018.

JLPF was closed to future accrual from 1 April 2011 and the Plan was closed to future accrual from September 2003.
Neither Scheme has any active members, only deferred members and pensioners.
The assets of both Schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
UK staff employed since 1 January 2002, who are entitled to retirement benefits, can choose to be members of a defined contribution stakeholder scheme sponsored by the Group in conjunction with Legal and General Assurance Society Limited.
Local defined contribution arrangements are available to overseas staff.
JLPF An actuarial valuation of JLPF was carried out as at 31 March 2016 by a qualified independent actuary, Willis Towers Watson.
At that date, JLPF was 85% funded on the technical provision funding basis.
This valuation took into account the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau CMI Bureau projections of mortality.
The actuarial deficit of 171 million is to be repaid over seven years as follows: By 31 March million 2017 24.5 2018 26.5 2019 29.1 2020 24.9 2021 25.7 2022 26.4 2023 24.6 The next triennial actuarial valuation of JLPF is due as at 31 March 2019.
During the year ended 31 December 2016, John Laing made deficit reduction contributions of 18.1 million in cash 2015 127.4 million in a mixture of cash, JLEN shares and PPP assets.
At 31 December 2016, JLPF's assets included PPP investments valued at 37.8 million 31 December 2015 41.4 million.
The Company has guaranteed to fund any cumulative shortfall in forecast project yield payments for some of these PPP investments up until 2017, but considers it unlikely that a net shortfall will arise.
The liability at 31 December 2016 allows for indexation of deferred pensions and post 5 April 1988 GMP pension increases based on the Consumer Price Index CPI.
The Plan No contributions were made to the Plan in the year ended 31 December 2016 31 December 2015 none.
At its last actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2014, the Plan had assets of 12.3 million and liabilities of 11.4 million resulting in an actuarial surplus of 0.9 million.
The next triennial actuarial valuation of the Plan is due as at 31 March 2017.

Virtually all equity and debt instruments held by JLPF have quoted prices in active markets Level 1.
Derivatives can be classified as Level 2 instruments and property and PPP investments as Level 3 instruments.
It is the policy of JLPF to use inflation swaps to hedge its exposure to inflation risk.
The JLPF Trustee invests in return seeking assets, such as equity, property and PPP investments, whilst balancing the risks of inflation and interest rate movements through the annuity buy-in agreement, inflation swaps and interest rate hedging.
In February 2009, the JLPF Trustee entered into a bulk annuity buy-in agreement with Aviva to mitigate JLPF's exposure to changes in liabilities.
At 31 December 2016, the underlying insurance policy was valued at 234.1 million 31 December 2015 214.2 million, being very substantially equal to the IAS 19 valuation of the related liabilities.
Analysis of amounts charged to operating profit Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 Pro forma and Statutory statutory million million Current service cost 1.6 1.3 The Schemes no longer have any active members.
Therefore, under the projected unit method of valuation the current service cost for JLPF will increase as a percentage of pensionable payroll as members approach retirement.
The current service cost has been included within administrative expenses.
