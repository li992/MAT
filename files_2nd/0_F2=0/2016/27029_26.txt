Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2016 0B1.
1BBasis of preparation and significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The groups financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore the groups financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
As more fully detailed in the Directors report, the groups financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The groups financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments which are required to be measured at fair value.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the groups annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015 except for the following amendments, which were effective for the first time in the current period but had no impact on the results or financial position of the group: Amendments to IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle : the majority of amendments are clarifications rather than substantive changes in existing requirements apart from amendments to IFRS 8 Operating Segments and IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures The following standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet mandatorily effective and in some cases have not yet been adopted by the EU and have not been applied by the group: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 Agriculture: Bearer Plants Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception: Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Disclosure Initiative: and Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 and 2013-2015 Cycle.
The group is conducting a review of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers which introduces a new revenue recognition model and is due to be effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 16 Leases will require nearly all leases to be recognised on the balance sheet as liabilities with corresponding assets being created, it will be effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
We will be assessing the likely impact of these new standards nearer the time of full adoption.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of other standards and interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective and in some cases have not yet been adopted by the EU will have a material financial impact on the groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Significant accounting policies under IFRS The significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the groups IFRS financial information are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Mitie Group plc and all its subsidiaries.
The financial statements of the parent company and subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP with the exception of a small number of entities.
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from inter-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
com 113 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2016 2B1.
3BBasis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the group.
The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures and associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the group.
Interests of non-controlling interest shareholders are measured at the non-controlling interests proportion of the net fair value of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for within shareholders equity.
No gain or loss is recognised on such transactions and goodwill is not re-measured.
Any difference between the change in the non-controlling interest and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.
Statutory and non-statutory measures of performance Our financial statements contain all the information and disclosures required by the relevant accounting standards and regulatory obligations that apply to the group.
We have elected to provide some further disclosures and performance measures, reported as before other items previously designated as Headline, in order to present our financial results in a way that demonstrates the performance of our business excluding restructuring and acquisition related costs, businesses being exited and amortisation or write off of acquired intangible assets.
Results before other items are a non-statutory measure.
Further detail of other items is set out in Note 5 to the financial statements.
Foreign currency The financial statements of each of the groups businesses are prepared in the functional currency applicable to that business.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the groups overseas operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on their acquisition, are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses are translated into sterling at average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising are recognised directly in equity in the groups hedging and translation reserve.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation shall be recognised in the income statement.
Revenue Revenue represents income recognised in respect of services provided during the period stated net of sales taxes and is earned predominantly within the United Kingdom.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
When revenue is recognised but has not yet been billed accrued income arises.
Deferred income arises when the group has billed clients in advance of recognising revenue.
All bid costs are expensed through the income statement up to the point where contract award or full recovery of the costs is virtually certain.
The confirmation of the preferred bidder for a contract by a client is the point at which the award of a contract is considered to be virtually certain.
Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract at the balance sheet date.
Revenue from time and material contracts is recognised at the contractual rates as labour hours and tasks are delivered and direct expenses incurred.
In other cases, the group distinguishes between the following types of contract: Revenue recognition: repeat service-based contracts single and bundled contracts Revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis unless this is not an accurate reflection of the work performed.
Where a straight-line basis is not appropriate, for example if specific works on contracts represent a significant element of the whole, revenue is recognised based on the percentage of completion method, based on the proportion of costs incurred at the balance sheet date relative to the total estimated cost of completing the contracted work.
114 Mitie Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 4B1.
5BBasis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Costs incurred after confirmation of preferred bidder, but before the commencement of full services under the contract target operating model, are defined as mobilisation costs.
These costs are included within trade and other receivables on the balance sheet provided that the costs relate directly to the contract, are separately identifiable, can be measured reliably and that the future net cash inflows from the contract are estimated to be no less than the amounts capitalised.
Such costs may be incurred when a contract is awarded, or when there is a subsequent change in the scope of contracted services.
The mobilisation costs are amortised over the contracted period including any contracted extension periods, generally on a straight-line basis, or on a basis to reflect the profile of work to be performed over the contracted period if the straight-line basis is not considered to be appropriate for the specific contract to which the costs relate.
If the contract becomes loss making, any unamortised costs are written off and the expected loss is provided for immediately.
Revenue recognition: long-term complex contracts The group has a number of long-term contracts for the provision of complex project-based services, predominantly integrated facilities management contracts.
Where the outcome of such complex project-based contracts can be measured reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is measured by the proportion of contract costs incurred for work performed to date compared to the total estimated contract costs.
Contract costs used to determine the stage of completion are recognised in the income statement as expenses in the period in which they are incurred and include transition costs which are costs incurred in the performance of transitioning services provided after confirmation of preferred bidder and before commencement of full services under the contract target operating model.
Contract costs also include transition costs arising when there is a subsequent change in the scope of contracted services.
Where the outcome of a complex project-based contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that contract costs will be recovered.
Full provision is made for all known or anticipated losses on each contract immediately as losses are forecast.
In a number of long-term complex contracts, the achievement of certain key performance indicators KPIs is a significant act which enables revenue to be recognised.
KPIs are generally measured contemporaneously with the performance of the service, rather than being measured over a long period or retrospectively.
Revenue recognition: other Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based upon tax rates and legislation that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
com 115 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2016 6B1.
7BBasis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when, there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities: or when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority: when the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
It is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the groups cash-generating units CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost less expected residual value of the assets over their estimated useful lives and is calculated on a straight-line basis as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold property 50 years Leasehold improvements period of the lease Plant and vehicles 310 years Annually the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Intangible assets Intangible assets identified in a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Software and development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset if the asset created can be identified, if it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits and if the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Following initial recognition, the carrying amount of an intangible asset is its cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that they may be impaired.
Amortisation expense is charged to administrative expenses in the income statement on a straight-line basis over its useful life.
116 Mitie Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 8B1.
9BBasis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Joint ventures and associates The group has an interest in joint ventures which are entities in which the group has joint control.
The group also has an interest in associates which are entities in which the group has significant influence.
The group accounts for its interest in joint ventures and associates using the equity method.
Under the equity method the groups share of the post-tax result of joint ventures and associates is reported as a single line item in the consolidated income statement.
The groups interest in joint ventures and associates is carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost plus postacquisition changes in the groups share of net assets.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs represent materials, direct labour and overheads incurred in bringing the inventories to their present condition and location.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and estimated selling costs.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the groups balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The group derecognises financial assets and liabilities only when the contractual rights and obligations are transferred, discharged or expire.
Assets that are assessed not to be individually impaired are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables includes the groups past experience of collecting payments, the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly with the exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the income statement.
Financial assets comprise loans and receivables and are measured at initial recognition at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities comprise trade payables, financing liabilities, including bank and other borrowings, put options on non-controlling interests and deferred contingent consideration.
These are measured at initial recognition at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost with the exception of derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value, and deferred contingent consideration which is measured at the Directors best estimate of the likely future obligation.
Bank and other borrowings are stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of transaction costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The group uses derivative financial instruments including cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the groups exposure to financial risks associated with interest rates and foreign exchange.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value, determined by reference to market rates, at each balance sheet date and included as financial assets or liabilities as appropriate.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
com 117 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2016 01.
11BBasis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued The group may designate certain hedging instruments including derivatives as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.
Fair value hedges Hedges are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the line of the income statement relating to the hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date.
Cash flow hedges Hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk associated with either a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity within the groups translation and hedging reserve.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at that time is accumulated in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations Hedges are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the foreign currency exposure to changes in the groups share in the net assets of a foreign operation.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the groups translation and hedging reserve.
Gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the same way as exchange differences relating to the foreign operation as described above.
Leasing Finance leases, which transfer to the group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased item or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Any lease incentives are amortised on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable period for which the group has contracted to lease the asset, together with any further terms for which the group has the option to continue to lease the asset if, at the inception of the lease, it is judged to be reasonably certain that the group will exercise the option.
118 Mitie Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 14B1.
15BBasis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Where applicable, the consideration for an acquisition includes any assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they result from additional information, obtained within one year from the acquisition date, about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are recognised in accordance with IAS 39, either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
Any business combinations prior to 1 April 2010 were accounted for using the standards in place prior to the adoption of IFRS 3 revised 2008 which differ in the following respects: transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition formed part of the acquisition costs: contingent consideration was recognised if, and only if, the group had a present obligation, the economic outflow was more likely than not and a reliable estimate was determinable: and subsequent adjustments to the contingent consideration were recognised as part of goodwill.
Share-based payments The group operates a number of executive and employee share option schemes.
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
The fair value excludes the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
For all grants of share options and awards, the fair value as at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo models and the corresponding expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
Save As You Earn SAYE options are treated as cancelled when employees cease to contribute to the scheme, resulting in an acceleration of the remainder of the related expense.
com 119 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2016 16B1.
17BBasis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Retirement benefit costs The group operates and participates in a number of defined benefit schemes.
In respect of the schemes in which the group participates, the group accounts for its legal and constructive obligations over the period of its participation which is for a fixed period only.
In addition, the group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees.
Payments to the defined contribution and stakeholder pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets excluding interest and the effect of the asset ceiling if applicable are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside profit and loss and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
Current service cost and past service cost are recognised in profit and loss, in administrative expenses, whilst the net interest cost is recognised in net finance costs.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
19BCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Critical judgements in applying the groups accounting policies In the process of applying the groups accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 above, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised for certain long-term complex projects based on the stage of completion of the contract activity.
This is measured by comparing the proportion of costs incurred, which include transition costs reflecting costs incurred in the performance of transitioning services see Note 1, against the estimated whole-life contract costs.
Particular judgement is required in evaluating the operational and financial business plans for these contracts to forecast the expected whole-life contract billings, costs and margin and to assess the recoverability of any resulting accrued income through the life of the contract.
In forming the judgement around expected whole-life contract billings, account is taken of potential deductions from and increments to revenue that may arise from the application of performance related measures under contracts.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Measurement and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets The measurement of intangible assets other than goodwill on a business combination involves estimation of future cash flows and the selection of suitable discount rates.
Determining whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of CGUs and also the selection of appropriate discount rates to use in order to calculate present values.
The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets is 532.4m 2015: 541.0m at the balance sheet date: see Notes 13 and 14.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed and the Board has concluded that no reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions would result in an impairment of the goodwill of any of the Soft FM, Hard FM or Property Management CGUs.
Further sensitivity testing was performed for the groups Healthcare CGU where the financial performance of the business has deteriorated during the year.
On the basis of this review the Board has concluded that no impairment to goodwill is necessary.
A sensitivity analysis is included in Note 13.

21BCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations The measurement of defined benefit obligations requires judgement.
It is dependent on material key assumptions including discount rates, life expectancy rates, future returns on assets and future contribution rates.
The present value of defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date is 201.9m 2015: 207.5m : see Note 37.
The sensitivity of defined benefit pension obligations to changes in principal actuarial assumptions is shown below: Increase decrease Change in in liability assumption m Discount rate 0.5% 19.1 -0.5% 19.1 Retail price inflation 0.5% 15.3 -0.5% 14.3 Consumer price inflation 0.5% 3.8 -0.5% 3.8 Salary increases 0.5% 3.8 -0.5% 2.9 Life expectancy 1 year 6.6 22B3.

The effective tax rate on profit before other items is generally higher than the statutory tax rate due to entertaining costs, commercial property depreciation and share-based payment charges not being wholly tax deductible and tax losses incurred overseas.
The UK corporation tax rate reduced from 21% to 20% on 1 April 2015.
Further reductions to 19% effective from April 2017 and then 18% effective from 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.
This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 March 2016 have been calculated based on rates of 20%, 19% and 18% in respect of deferred tax expected to reverse before 1 April 2017, 1 April 2020 and after this date respectively.

126 Mitie Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 46B13.
47BGoodwill continued Goodwill has been allocated to CGUs, which align with the business segments, as this is how goodwill is monitored by the group internally.
Goodwill has arisen principally on the acquisitions of Initial Security in 2006 Soft FM, Dalkia Technical Facilities Management in 2009 Hard FM and Enara Healthcare in 2012.
Discount Discount Goodwill Goodwill rate 2016 rate 2015 2016 2015 % % m m Soft FM 7.9 8.7 171.8 171.3 Hard FM 8.0 8.7 101.3 101.3 Property Management 9.2 10.0 85.2 85.2 Healthcare 9.1 10.0 107.2 106.6 465.5 464.4 The group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indicators that goodwill may be impaired.
Key assumptions The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to revenue and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in revenue and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
Growth rates and terminal values The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent one year financial budgets approved by the Board, extrapolated for four future years by the expected growth applicable to each unit with a terminal value using an inflationary growth rate assumption in the range 2.0% 2.5% dependent on the CGU.
Discount rates The pre-tax rates used to discount the forecast cash flows from CGUs are derived from the Companys post-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital, which was 7.0% at 31 March 2016 2015: 7.4%, and adjusted for the risks specific to the market in which the CGU operates.
All CGUs have the same access to the groups treasury functions and borrowing lines to fund their operations.
Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis has been performed and the Directors have concluded that no reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions would result in an impairment of the goodwill of any of the Soft Facilities Management, Hard Facilities Management and Property Management CGUs.
In particular, a 1% increase in the discount rate or a 1% decrease in the terminal value growth rate would not result in impairment in any of these CGUs.
Review of the carrying value of goodwill in the Healthcare CGU The financial performance of the Healthcare business has deteriorated in the last financial year and that division has reported an operating loss before other items of 4.0m for that period.
Management has been taking positive action to reshape the business during the year to meet future market opportunities and is encouraged by contract awards which give confidence that conditions are beginning to improve.
The Directors remain confident in the long-term prospects of the healthcare sector and continue to closely monitor the financial performance of the group's Healthcare cash-generating unit CGU.
In light of recent trading performance a revised long-term business plan for the Healthcare business has been developed with reductions to forecast profits and cash flows.
The Directors have reviewed the revised long-term business plan for the Healthcare business and believe that the assumptions on which it is based are reasonable given current performance and market conditions.
The Directors continue to see long-term growth opportunities in the domiciliary care and other related healthcare markets, especially in light of the increasing political focus on the current funding of the sector and the expected demographic shift in the UK.
com 127 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2016 46B13.
47BGoodwill continued The Directors recognise that there are risks and uncertainties in its Healthcare CGU if the performance of the business does not improve as expected over the longer term in line with the revised business plan.
Factors that could cause deterioration in the future cash flows of the business compared to the plan include: the inability to recruit and retain staff at appropriate wage rates: the inability to win new and retain existing contracts to provide care hours at sustainable prices: and an adverse structural change to outsourcing of care in the UK caused by changes in UK Government policy.
The carrying value of goodwill relating to the Healthcare CGU of 107.2m 2015: 106.6m was 38.2m less than the recoverable amount, being the net present value of the future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the business.
These cash flow forecasts are derived from the detailed long term business plan, with a terminal value using an inflationary growth rate assumption of 2.5% based on industry growth forecasts and compound annual revenue growth rates of 16% using revenue of 78.0m reported for the year ended 31 March 2016 as the reference point for the rate of compound annual revenue growth underpinning the growth in operating profit in the first five years of the plan.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for the CGU is 9.1%, which has been adjusted for the risks specific to the market in which the CGU operates.
Further sensitivity testing was performed for the Healthcare CGU as the Directors recognise that it is possible that an impairment to the healthcare goodwill could be identified if the performance of the business does not improve as expected over the longer term in line with the business plan.
They have considered the impact of a range of sensitivities on the headroom between the recoverable amount and the carrying value of the goodwill attributable to the Healthcare CGU.
The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets becomes equal to its recoverable amount following the application of the following sensitivities: an increase in the pre-tax discount rate of 1.9%: or a fall of 2.0% in the terminal value growth rate to a long-term inflationary assumption of 0.5%: or a 27% reduction in operating profit in year 5 and subsequent years compared to the revised business plan.
Based on the commentary and analysis above, and considering current market conditions, the Directors have concluded that the value of goodwill of the Healthcare CGU is not impaired.

Software and development costs are amortised over their useful lives of between five and ten years, once they have been brought into use.
The customer relationships relating to the Healthcare business have been impairment tested in accordance with IAS 36 following the losses made by that business.
As a result a write off of 6.2m has been recognised as a result of healthcare contracts exited during the year on financial grounds.

79BFinancing liabilities continued With the exception of derivative financial instruments and the private placement notes, all financing liabilities are held at amortised cost.
The Directors estimate that their carrying value approximates their fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as hedges for which hedge accounting can be applied see Note 27.
The carrying value of the private placement notes at 31 March 2016 includes a fair value adjustment for interest rate and currency risk of 0.7m 2015: 0.9m.
The fair value of the private placement notes is not significantly different from their carrying value.
Private placement notes On 13 December 2012, the group issued US$153.0m and 55.0m of private placement PP notes in the United States Private Placement market.
This followed the issue on 16 December 2010 of US$96.0m and 40.0m of PP notes in the United States Private Placement market.
The PP notes are unsecured and rank pari passu with other senior unsecured indebtedness of the group.
In order to manage the risk of foreign currency fluctuations and to manage the groups finance costs through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt, the group has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps.
The swap contracts have the same duration and other critical terms as the borrowings and are considered to be highly effective.
The amount, maturity and interest terms of the PP notes are as shown below: Tranche Maturity date Amount Interest terms Swap interest 7 year 16 December 2017 US$48.0m US$ fixed at 3.39% fixed at 3.88% 7 year 16 December 2017 US$48.0m US$ fixed at 3.39% LIBOR 1.26% 9 year 16 December 2019 40.0m fixed at 4.38% n a 10 year 16 December 2022 US$76.0m US$ fixed at 3.85% fixed at 4.05% 10 year 16 December 2022 US$77.0m US$ fixed at 3.85% fixed at 4.02% 10 year 16 December 2022 25.0m fixed at 3.87% n a 12 year 16 December 2024 30.0m fixed at 4.04% n a The weighted average interest rates paid during the year on the overdrafts and loans outstanding were as follows: 2016 2015 % % Overdrafts 2.1 2.7 Bank loans 1.3 1.5 Private placement notes 3.8 3.8 At 31 March 2016, the group had available 259.4m 2015: 261.1m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
The facilities have an expiry date of July 2019.
The loans carry interest rates which are currently determined at 1.0% over LIBOR.
Details of the groups contingent liabilities are provided in Note 34.
81BFinancial instruments Classification The groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and financing assets.
With the exception of derivative financial instruments, all financial assets are classified as loans and receivables.
The groups principal financial liabilities are trade payables, financing liabilities and deferred contingent consideration.
With the exception of derivative financial instruments, private placement notes and deferred contingent consideration, all financial liabilities are held at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments and private placement loan notes are measured initially at fair value at the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as hedges for which hedge accounting can be applied.
Deferred contingent consideration is measured at the Directors best estimate of the likely future obligation.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the bases for recognition of income and expense for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in Note 1. www.
com 135 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2016 82B 27.
83BFinancial instruments continued Risk management objectives The groups treasury function monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the group.
These risks include those arising from interest rates, foreign currencies, liquidity, credit and capital management.
The group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using effective control measures and, where appropriate, derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by group policies and reviewed regularly.
Group policy is not to trade in financial instruments.
The risk management policies remain unchanged from the previous year.
Interest rate risk The groups activities expose it to the financial risks of interest rates.
The groups treasury function reviews its risk management strategy on a regular basis and will appropriately enter into derivative financial instruments in order to manage interest rate risk.
Having issued US$249.0m and 95.0m of notes in the US PP fixed rate market, the group has swapped US$48.0m into floating rate debt.
Interest rate sensitivity The interest rate sensitivity has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
All financial liabilities, other than financing liabilities, are interest free.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the groups profit after tax for the year ended 31 March 2016 and reserves would decrease increase by 0.4m 2015: 0.3m.
Foreign currency risk The group has limited exposure to transactional foreign currency risk from trading transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of individual group entities and some exposure to translational foreign currency risk from the translation of its operations in Europe.
The group considers the need to hedge its exposures appropriately and will enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate any significant risks.
In addition, the group has fully hedged the US dollar exposure on its PP notes into sterling using cross currency interest rate swaps see Hedging activities below.
At 31 March 2016 5.0m 2015: 5.5m of cash and cash equivalents were held in foreign currencies.
Included in bank loans were 13.6m 2015: 13.9m of loans denominated in foreign currency.
Liquidity risk The group monitors its liquidity risk using a cash flow projection model which considers the maturity of the groups assets and liabilities and the projected cash flows from operations.
Bank facilities, which allow for appropriate headroom in the groups daily cash movements, are then arranged.
Details of our bank facilities can be found in Note 26.
The tables below summarise the maturity profile including both undiscounted interest and principal cash flows of the groups financial liabilities: In the second Within to fifth After one year years five years Total Financial liabilities at 31 March 2016 m m m m Trade creditors 206.8 206.8 Financing liabilities 28.5 140.6 170.8 339.9 Deferred contingent consideration 0.4 0.4 Financial liabilities 235.7 140.6 170.8 547.1 136 Mitie Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 82B27.

The value of business placed with financial institutions is reviewed on a daily basis.
The groups credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies and are managed through regular review.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet in relation to the groups trade receivables are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
Before accepting a new customer, the group uses external credit scoring systems to assess the potential customers credit quality and define an appropriate credit limit which is reviewed regularly.
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the group considers the credit quality of the counterparty.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The Directors believe that there is no further provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts at the balance sheet date.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to trade receivables at the balance sheet date is the fair value of trade receivables.
The groups customer base is large and unrelated and, accordingly, the group does not have a significant concentration of credit risk with any one counterparty or group of counterparties.
Capital management risk The group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the group consists of net debt per Note 30 and equity per the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The groups capital structure is reviewed regularly.
In 2013, the Board approved a share purchase policy to maintain share numbers at a broadly consistent level year on year with the aim of ensuring that the interests of shareholders are not diluted by the issue of shares that support the groups various share schemes, nor by the issue of shares as consideration for earn outs under the Mitie model.
During the year, the group bought back 5.2m 2015: nil shares at a cost of 15.2m 2015: nil and subsequently cancelled these shares.
To offset shares issued under various share schemes and to hedge against shares to be issued in the future, 2.3m 2015: 3.7m shares were bought to be held in Treasury at a total cost of 6.6m 2015: 10.7m.
Further details are provided in Notes 31 and 32.
The group is not subject to externally imposed regulatory capital requirements with the exception of those applicable to the groups captive insurance subsidiary, which is monitored on a regular basis.
Hedging activities Cash flow hedges The group holds a number of cross currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges.
Bi-annual fixed interest cash flows arising over the periods to December 2022 and denominated in US$ from the US Private Placement market are exchanged for fixed interest cash flows denominated in sterling.
The group also holds a number of forward exchange currency contracts designated as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions.
All cash flow hedges were assessed as being highly effective as at 31 March 2016. www.

85BFinancial instruments continued Fair value hedges The group holds a number of cross currency interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges.
Fixed interest cash flows denominated in US$ from the US Private Placement market are exchanged for floating interest cash flows denominated in sterling.
All fair value hedges were assessed as being highly effective as at 31 March 2016.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations Included in bank loans at 31 March 2016 was a borrowing of 9.5m 2015: 9.5m which has been designated as a hedge of the net investment in the Republic of Ireland business of Dalkia FM in Ireland and is being used to hedge the groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on this investment.
Gains or losses on the translation of the borrowing are transferred to equity to offset gains or losses on the translation of the net investment.
Derivative financial instruments The carrying values of derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date were as follows: Assets Assets Liabilities Liabilities 2016 2015 2016 2015 m m m m Cross currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges 10.3 3.7 Cross currency interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges 4.1 3.1 Derivative financial instruments hedging private placement notes 14.4 6.8 Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on a discounted cash flow analysis using appropriate market information for the duration of the instruments.
Financial instruments fair value disclosure Fair value measurements are classified into three levels, depending on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from other observable inputs for the asset or liability: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The directors consider that the derivative financial instruments fall into Level 2 and that deferred contingent consideration falls into Level 3.
Deferred contingent consideration is measured at the Directors best estimate of the likely future obligation based on the attainment of certain profit targets.
In assessing the likely future obligation, the Directors have used their experience and knowledge of market conditions, alongside internal business plans and growth forecasts.
Actual amounts payable may vary up to a maximum of 0.4m 2015: 11.4m dependent upon the results of the acquired businesses.
The following table shows the reconciliation from the opening to closing balances for Level 3 fair values: Put options Deferred of noncontingent controlling consideration interests m m At 1 April 2015 11.4 8.0 Movement of put options recognised in equity 8.0 Other amounts recognised through equity arising from transactions from non-controlling interests 11.0 At 31 March 2016 0.4 There were no transfers between levels during the year.

99BAcquisitions During the year a net cash outflow of 8.0m arose on the acquisitions set out below: m Procius Limited 0.3 Source Eight Limited 0.6 Direct Enquiries Holdings Limited 3.8 Creativevents Limited 4.7 Mitie Property Services UK Limited 1.1 Tascor Medical Services Limited Other 0.3 Net cash outflow on acquisitions 8.0 Current year acquisitions Entities acquired during the year contributed 2.1m to revenue and 0.1m to the groups operating profit before other items for the period.
If the acquisitions had taken place at the start of the period, the groups revenue and operating profit before other items would have been approximately 2,244m and 130m respectively.
The acquisitions enhanced our overall offering to clients.
The goodwill arising on the acquisitions is attributable to the underlying profitability of the companies in the acquired group, expected profitability arising from new business and the anticipated future operating synergies arising from assimilation into Mitie.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Purchase of Tascor Medical Services Limited On 29 January 2016, Mitie acquired the leading UK custodial medical services provider for a total consideration of 0.6m nil on a cash free basis, giving rise to goodwill of 0.7m.
The transaction has been accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 2008 and is not material to the group.
Purchase of non-controlling interests During the year Mitie purchased 49% of the share capital of Creativevents Limited for a cash consideration of 4.7m of which was paid in the year.
During 2016, Mitie reduced its original business valuation of the acquisition of Mitie Property Services UK Limited in 2013 which resulted in a net cash inflow of 1.1m.
Prior year acquisitions The provisional acquisition accounting for prior year acquisitions as disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts was reviewed during the period resulting in a reduction of the fair value of net assets acquired of 0.1m and an increase of goodwill of 0.1m.
These adjustments comprise an adjustment to estimates made at the end of the prior year and within a year from the date of acquisition in line with the requirements of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The adjustments have not materially changed the net assets of the group and therefore the 2015 comparative information has not been restated.
105BContingent liabilities The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims that are in the ordinary course of business.
The Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the groups financial position, other than as provided for in the accounts.
Deferred contingent consideration relating to acquisitions has been accrued at the Directors best estimate of the likely future obligation of 0.4m 2015: 11.4m per Note 28.
This is the maximum amount payable subject to certain targets being attained.
In addition, the group and its subsidiaries have provided guarantees and indemnities in respect of performance, issued by financial institutions on its behalf, amounting to 23.6m 2015: 28.9m in the ordinary course of business.
These are not expected to result in any material financial loss.

No arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
109BShare-based payments The Company has six equity-settled share option schemes: Discretionary share plans: The Mitie Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was introduced in 2007.
The awards of shares or rights to acquire shares the awards are offered to a small number of key senior management.
Where offered as options the exercise price is nil.
The vesting period is three years, although for awards granted in 2015 and subsequently some are subject to a holding period of up to a further two years.
If the awards remain unexercised after a period of twelve months from the date of vesting the awards expire.
The awards may be forfeited if the employee leaves the group.
Before the awards can be exercised, performance conditions must be satisfied which are based on movements in a range of market and non-market measures over a three year period.
The group also awards performance-related bonuses for Executive Directors which are deferred in shares and are accounted for as a share-based payment charge.
The Mitie Group plc 2001 Executive share option scheme ESO The Executive share option scheme exercise price is equal to the average market value of the shares over the five day period immediately preceding the date of grant.
The vesting period is three years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant the options expire.
Options may be forfeited if the employee leaves the group.
Before options can be exercised, a performance condition must be satisfied: the performance condition is linked to the percentage growth in earnings per share over a three year period.
The Mitie Group plc 2011 Executive share option scheme ESO The Executive share option scheme exercise price is equal to the average market value of the shares on the business day preceding grant or, if the Committee decides, the average market value of shares over a number of preceding business days not to exceed 20.
The Conditional share plan CSP The CSP was introduced in 2014 and is a discretionary scheme.
The awards of shares or the rights to acquire shares the award are offered to a small number of key senior management.
The vesting period is determined at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and is generally two or three years.
If the awards remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant the awards expire.
142 Mitie Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 108B36.
109BShare-based payments continued Non-discretionary share plans: The Mitie Group plc 2011 SAYE scheme The SAYE scheme is open to all employees.
The exercise price is not less than 80% of the market value of the shares determined using either: the share price preceding the date on which invitations to participate in the scheme are issued, or an average share price over five days preceding the invitation date.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of six months from the date of vesting, the options expire.
The Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP was introduced in 2011 and is a non-discretionary scheme open to all eligible UK resident employees.
Under the scheme, eligible employees are invited to invest in Partnership Shares which are purchased in the market on their behalf and held in a separate UK trust.
One Matching Share is awarded for every ten Partnership Shares purchased and has a holding period of three years.
Matching Shares are funded by way of market purchases.

The group participates in a number of other defined benefit schemes Other schemes in respect of certain employees who joined the group under the Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment Regulations 2006 TUPE.
Defined contribution schemes A defined contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which the group pays contributions to an independently administered fund such contributions are based upon a fixed percentage of employees pay.
The group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions to the fund once the contributions have been paid.
Members benefits are determined by the amount of contributions paid, together with investment returns earned on the contributions arising from the performance of each individuals chosen investments and the type of pension the member chooses to take at retirement.
As a result, actuarial risk that pension will be lower than expected and investment risk that assets invested in do not perform in line with expectations are borne by the employee.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.
The group operates three separate schemes: a stakeholder defined contribution plan, which is closed to new members: a self-invested personal pension plan, which is closed to new members: and a group personal pension GPP plan.
Employer contributions are payable to each on a matched basis requiring employee contributions to be paid.
Employees have the option to pay their share via a salary sacrifice arrangement.
The scheme used to satisfy auto-enrolment compliance is a master trust, The Peoples Pension.
During the year, the group made a total contribution to the defined contribution schemes of 13.3m 2015: 10.7m and contributions to the auto-enrolment scheme of 4.1m 2015: 4.1m, which are included in the income statement charge.
The group expects to make contributions of a similar amount in the coming year.
Defined benefit schemes Group scheme The Group scheme provides benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on members length of service and their final pensionable pay.
The scheme closed to new members in 2006, with new employees able to join one of the defined contribution schemes.
Pensions in payment are generally increased in line with RPI inflation, subject to certain caps and floors.
Benefits are payable on death and other events such as withdrawal from active service.
The Group scheme is operated under the UK regulatory framework.
Benefits are paid to members from the trust-administered fund, where the trust is responsible for ensuring that the scheme is sufficiently funded to meet current and future benefit payments.
Plan assets are held in trust and are governed by pension legislation.
If investment experience is worse than expected or the actuarial assessment of the schemes liabilities increases, the groups financial obligations to the scheme rise.

115BRetirement benefit schemes continued The nature of the relationship between the group and the Trustee is also governed by local regulations and practice.
The Trustee must agree a funding plan with the sponsoring company such that any funding shortfall is expected to be met by additional contributions and investment outperformance.
In order to assess the level of contributions required, triennial valuations are carried out with the schemes obligations measured using prudent assumptions which are determined by the Trustee with advice from the scheme actuary.
The most recent triennial valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2014.
The scheme Trustees other duties include managing the investment of the schemes assets, administration of plan benefits and exercising of discretionary powers.
The group works closely with the Trustees to manage the scheme.
Other defined benefit schemes Grouped together under Other schemes are a number of schemes to which the group makes contributions under Admitted Body status to clients generally government or local government entities defined benefit schemes in respect of certain employees who transferred to Mitie under TUPE.
The valuations of the Other schemes are updated by an actuary at each balance sheet date.
For the Admitted Body Schemes, which are largely sections of the Local Government Pension Scheme, the group will only participate for a finite period up to the end of the relevant contract.
The group is required to pay regular contributions as decided by the relevant scheme actuaries and detailed in each schemes Contributions Certificate, which are calculated every three years as part of a triennial valuation.
In a number of cases contributions payable by the employer are capped and any excess is recovered from the entity that the employees transferred from.
In addition, in certain cases, at the end of the contract the group will be required to pay any deficit as determined by the scheme actuary that is assessed for its notional section of the scheme.
Further information in respect of the Group scheme and Other schemes The table below sets out the details of the latest funding valuation of the Group scheme as at 31 March 2014.
The group made a total contribution to the Group scheme of 2.5m during the year 2015: 2.8m.
The group expects to make contributions of around 2.5m to the Group scheme in the coming year.
Employees contribution to the cost of the scheme 7.5% of pensionable salaries is generally paid through a salary sacrifice arrangement.
The group made contributions to the Other schemes of 0.4m in the year 2015: 0.4m.
The group expects to make contributions of around 0.4m to the Other schemes in the coming year.
Details of latest funding valuation Group scheme Date of last formal funding valuation 31 March 2014 Assets at valuation date 143.6 million Funding liabilities at valuation date 149.6 million Deficit at valuation date 6.0 million Contribution rate agreed to meet the cost of benefits accruing, including related expenses 22.3% of pensionable salary Employer contribution rate including expenses 14.8% of pensionable salary Employee contribution rate 7.5% of pensionable salary To eliminate the funding deficit the Trustee and the group have agreed that additional contributions i. e. over and above those required to cover benefits being accrued will be paid into the scheme of 11.1m by 31 March 2024 or if less, the deficit at that time.
The group has provided security for this liability by a UK clearing bank letter of credit building up to that value to 2024.
Under this recovery plan, if the assumptions made are borne out in practice, the deficit will be eliminated by 31 March 2024.

The discount rate used to determine the present value of the obligations is set by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds.
The assumptions for price inflation are set by reference to the difference between yields on longer-term conventional government bonds and index-linked bonds.
The assumption for increases in pensionable pay takes into account expected salary inflation, the cap at CPI, and how often the cap is likely to be exceeded.
The assumptions for life expectancy have been set with reference to the actuarial tables used in the latest funding valuations, with a lower best-estimate allowance for future improvements to mortality.

To reduce volatility, certain assets are held in a matching portfolio, which largely consists of government and corporate bonds, designed to mirror movements in corresponding liabilities.
Around 73% 2015: 74% of the assets are held in equities, property and pooled investment vehicles which seek a higher expected level of return over the long term.
7m 2015: 7m of the property assets represent freehold property, the rest are quoted property investments.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation for the Group scheme to changes in the principal assumptions is shown in the table below: Sensitivity of defined benefit obligation to key assumptions Impact on defined benefit obligation Change in Increase in assumption assumption Decrease in assumption Discount rate 0.1% Decrease by 2.0% Increase by 2.0% RPI inflation 0.1% Increase by 1.6% Decrease by 1.5% CPI inflation excluding pay 0.1% Increase by 0.4% Decrease by 0.4% Pay increases 0.1% Increase by 0.4% Decrease by 0.3% Life expectancy 1 year Increase by 3.4% Including other inflation-linked assumptions CPI inflation, pension increases, salary growth The sensitivity information shown above has been prepared using the same method as adopted when adjusting the results of the latest funding valuation to the balance sheet date.
Some of the above changes in assumptions may have an impact on the value of the schemes investment holdings.
For example, the Group scheme holds a proportion of its assets in UK corporate bonds.
A fall in the discount rate as a result of lower UK corporate bond yields would lead to an increase in the value of these assets, thus mitigating the increase in the defined benefit obligation to some extent.
The duration, or average term to payment for the benefits due, weighted by liability, is around 20 years for the Group scheme.

123BRetirement benefit schemes continued Risks and risk management The Group scheme, in common with the majority of UK plans, has a number of risks.
These areas of risk and the ways in which the group has sought to manage them, are set out in the table below.
The risks are considered from both a funding perspective, which drives the cash commitments of the group, and from an accounting perspective, i. e. the extent to which such risks affect the amounts recorded in the groups financial statements: Risk Description Asset The funding liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to government bond yields, with volatility allowance for additional return to be generated from the investment portfolio.
The defined benefit obligation for accounting is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields.
The Group scheme holds a large proportion of its assets 73% in equities and other return-seeking assets principally diversified growth funds DGFs and property.
The returns on such assets tend to be volatile and are not correlated to government bonds.
This means that the funding level has the potential to be volatile in the short term, potentially resulting in short-term cash requirements or alternative security offers which are acceptable to the Trustee and an increase in the net defined benefit liability recorded on the groups balance sheet.
The group believes that equities and DGFs offer the best returns over the long term with an acceptable level of risk and hence holds a significant proportion of these types of asset.
However, the schemes assets are welldiversified by investing in a range of asset classes, including property, government bonds and corporate bonds.
The Group scheme holds 26% of its assets in DGFs which seek to maintain high levels of return whilst achieving lower volatility than direct equity funds.
The allocation to return seeking assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the schemes long-term objectives.
The investment in bonds is discussed further below.
Changes in Falling bond yields tend to increase the funding and accounting liabilities.
However, the investment in corporate bond yields and government bonds offers a degree of matching, i. e. the movement in assets arising from changes in bond yields partially matches the movement in the funding or accounting liabilities.
In this way, the exposure to movements in bond yields is reduced.
Inflation risk The majority of the schemes benefit obligations are linked to inflation.
Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation.
The majority of the Group schemes assets are either unaffected by inflation fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated with inflation equities, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide a pension for the life of the member, so unexpected expectancy increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
Areas of risk management Although investment decisions in the scheme are the responsibility of the Trustee, the group takes an active interest to ensure that pension plan risks are managed efficiently.
The group and Trustee have agreed a long-term strategy for reducing investment risk where appropriate.
Certain benefits payable on death before retirement are insured.
