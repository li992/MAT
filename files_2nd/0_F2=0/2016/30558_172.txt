11.16 Pensions 11.16.1 Defined benefit schemes: summary and description The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme CARE and a cash balance scheme RSP.
The CARE Scheme provides benefits based on age at date of retirement, years of service and a formula using either the employees compensation package or career average revalued earnings CARE.
The RSP is a cash balance scheme, which provides a lump sum benefit based upon a defined proportion of an employees annual earnings, which is revalued each year in line with inflation.
For details on the scheme rules, the closure of the CARE Scheme to future accrual and the defined contribution set up costs see note 8.
Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Financial statements 108 Notes to the Company financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 31 January 2016 11 Company financial statements continued 11.16 Pensions continued The position of each scheme at 31 January 2016 is as follows: 2016 2015 m m CARE Scheme 61 11 RSP 8 4 Net pension asset 69 15 At the year end, schemes in surplus have been disclosed within assets on the balance sheet.
The Company has taken legal advice in respect of the CARE Scheme and the RSP with regard to the recognition of a pension surplus and also recognition of a minimum funding requirement under IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirement and their interaction.
This advice concluded that recognition of a surplus is appropriate on the basis that the Company has an unconditional right to a refund of a surplus.
Amendments to the current version of IFRIC 14 are currently being considered.
The legal advice received by the Company has concluded that the above accounting treatment should not be affected by the current exposure draft of the revised wording to IFRIC 14.
The Schemes are registered schemes under the provisions of Schedule 36 of the Finance Act 2004 and the assets are held in legally separate, trusteeadministered funds.
The Board of each Scheme is required by law to act in the best interest of the Scheme participants and is responsible for setting the investment, funding and governance policies of the fund.
A representative of the Company attends Trustee Investment Committee meetings in order to provide the Companys view on investment strategy, but the ultimate power lies with the Trustees.
The Deed and Rules of the Morrison Scheme gives the Trustees the power to set contributions.
In the RSP this power is given to the Company, subject to regulatory override.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at 5 April 2013 for the Morrison Scheme and the RSP.
The results of these valuations for the CARE Scheme have been used and updated for IAS 19 Employee benefits purposes for the period to 31 January 2016 by a qualified independent actuary.
For the RSP an actuarial valuation for the purposes of IAS19, based on member data as at 31 December 2015, has been completed and updated to 1 February 2016 by a qualified independent actuary.
The Schemes expose the Company to inflation risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
In addition, the CARE Scheme exposes the Company to longevity risk.

They are not necessarily intended to be realised in the short term.
The Trustees of each Scheme invest in different categories of asset and in different allocations amongst those assets, according to the investment principles of that Scheme.
Currently, the investment strategy of the CARE Scheme is to maintain a balance of approximately 40% equities and 60% bond-like investments.
RSP investments are currently based primarily in equities.
There are no direct investments in the parent Companys own shares or property occupied by any member of the Group.

This is achieved through the use of liability driven investments LDI, whose main goal is to have sufficient assets to meet all current and future liabilities as they fall due.
LDI involves the use of derivatives such as swaps and other investment instruments.
There are no annuities or longevity swaps.
The movement in the fair value of the Schemes assets over the period was as follows: 2016 2016 2015 2015 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Fair value of scheme assets at start of period 1,106 87 817 39 Interest income 34 3 44 4 Return on scheme assets excluding interest 82 5 239 7 Employer contributions 12 49 21 39 Employee contributions 6 1 2 Benefits paid 21 1 16 4 Administrative expenses 2 1 Fair value of scheme assets at end of period 1,047 138 1,106 87 The Company has previously entered into an agreement under which it has contributed interests in a Scottish Limited Partnership SLP valued at 29m as at 31 January 2016 to the CARE Scheme.
The CARE Schemes interest in the SLP increases the net pension asset on an accounting basis because the investment held by the Scheme qualifies as an asset for FRS 101 purposes.
The contribution of 30m the value to the CARE Scheme as at 31 January 2013 qualified for tax relief in 2012 13, but due to the magnitude, relief is spread over four years.
As a partner in the SLP, the CARE Scheme is entitled to receive a share of the profits of the SLP twice a year for 20 years.
The SLP made a contribution of 2.2m over the year ending 31 January 2016, and will make annual contributions of 2.2m for a further 17 years, dependent on funding levels in the schemes.
11.16.3 Present value of obligations The movement in the defined benefit obligation over the period was as follows: 2016 2016 2015 2015 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Defined benefit obligation at start of period 1,095 83 805 37 Current service cost 12 62 24 37 Interest expense 34 3 36 2 Actuarial loss demographic assumptions 17 Actuarial gain loss financial assumptions 133 18 262 16 Actuarial gain experience 5 7 Curtailment gain 1 Employee contributions 6 1 2 Benefits paid 21 1 16 4 Defined benefit obligation at end of period 986 130 1,095 83 The durations of the defined benefit obligations at the end of the 2016 reporting period are: RSP 20 years and CARE 25 years.
The weighted average duration of the two schemes is 24 years.

The mortality tables used at both year ends 2015 and 2016 are the S1PMA S1PFA-Heavy tables males females based on year of birth.
Following analysis completed as part of the 2013 actuarial valuations a scaling factor of 110% was applied to the mortality tables used in the Morrison Scheme.
Amongst the UK population, there is a continuing trend for a generation to live longer than the preceding generation.
For the 2015 and 2016 year ends, and in line with the 2013 actuarial valuations the mortality projections used were the CMI 2012 rates with an annual rate of improvement of 1.5% p. a.

In practice any movement in assumptions could be accompanied by a partially offsetting change in asset values, and the corresponding overall impact on the net asset liability is therefore likely to be lower than the amounts below in a number of scenarios.
Extrapolation of the sensitivities shown may not be appropriate.
