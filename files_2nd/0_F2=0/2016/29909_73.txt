Volatility is a measure of the amount by which a price is expected to fluctuate during a period.
The measure of volatility used in the Groups option pricing models is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a period of time.
In estimating the future volatility of the Companys share price, the Board considers the historical volatility of the share price over the most recent period that is generally commensurate with the expected term of the option, taking into account the remaining contractual life of the option.
