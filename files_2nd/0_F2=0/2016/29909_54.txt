2 Act 2015included legislation to reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020.
These rate reductions were substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and therefore included in these consolidated financial statements.
In addition to the changes in the rates of corporation tax disclosed above it was announced in the March 2016 Budget Statement that the main rate of corporation tax will be further reduced by 1% to 17% from 1 April 2020.
