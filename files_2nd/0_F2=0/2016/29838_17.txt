SEGMENT INFORMATION The Group has three reportable segments, retail, wholesale and licence income.
For each of the three segments, the Groups chief operating decision maker the Board reviews internal management reports on a four weekly basis.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as described in note 1 on pages 72 to 77.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below.
Performance for the retail segment is measured based on operating contribution, whereas performance of the wholesale segment is measured based on gross profit and performance of the licence segment is measured based on royalty income, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board.
Segment results before exceptional items are used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the performance of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.
Intersegment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
