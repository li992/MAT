The Common Reporting Standard As of 1 January 2016 a new piece of tax legislation, The OECD Common Reporting Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account information The Common Reporting Standard, came into effect.
The legislation requires investment trust companies to provide personal information to HMRC on certain investors who purchase shares in investment trusts.
Accordingly Aberforth Smaller Companies Trust plc will have to provide information annually to the local tax authority on the tax residencies of a number of non-UK based certificated shareholders and corporate entities.
All new shareholders, excluding those whose shares are held in CREST, who came on to the share register with effect from 1 January 2016 will be sent a certification form for the purposes of collecting this information.
For further information, please see HMRCs Quick Guide: Automatic Exchange of Information information for account holders https: www.
Beware of Share Fraud Shareholders may receive unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters which imply a connection to the Company.
These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares.
Shareholders may also be advised that there is an imminent offer for the Company, and the caller may offer to buy shares at significantly above the market price if an administration fee is paid.
This is known as boiler room fraud.

The total is then divided by two to give a ratio between 0% and 100%.
Active Share is addressed in How Active Is Your Fund Manager?
Antti Petajisto and Martijn Cremers, Yale School of Management, 2009.
Discount is the amount by which the stockmarket price per Ordinary Share is lower than the Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share.
The discount is normally expressed as a percentage of the Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share.
Gearing represents borrowings by an investment trust to buy investments if the Managers expect stockmarkets to rise, with a view to making a greater return on the money borrowed than the cost of the borrowing.
If stockmarkets rise, gearing can increase the Companys returns, but, if they fall, losses will be greater.
Leverage for the purposes of the AIFM Directive, is any method which increases the Companys exposure to stockmarkets whether through borrowings, derivatives or any other means.
It is expressed as a ratio of the Companys exposure to its NetAssetValue.
In summary, the gross method measures the Companys exposure before applying hedging or netting arrangements.
The commitment method allows certain hedging or netting arrangements to be offset.
ASCoT has no hedging or netting arrangements.
Market Capitalisation of a Company is calculated by multiplying the stockmarket price per Ordinary Share by the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue.
Net Asset Value, also described as Shareholders funds, is the value of total assets less liabilities.
Liabilities for this purpose include borrowings as well as current liabilities.
The Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing this amount by the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue.
Net Asset Value Total Return represents the theoretical return on Shareholders funds per share assuming that dividends paid to Shareholders were reinvested at the Net Asset Value at the time the shares were quoted ex dividend.
Ongoing Charges is the total cost of investment management fees and other operating expenses as a percentage of the average published net asset value over the period calculated per AIC guidelines.
Premium is the amount by which the stockmarket price per Ordinary Share exceeds the Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share.
The premium is normally expressed as a percentage of the Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share.
