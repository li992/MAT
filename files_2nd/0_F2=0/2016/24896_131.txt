Share-based payments continued The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 4.24 FY15: 3.30.
The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model for the ESOP and SAYE and Monte Carlo simulations for the LTIP and DBP.
The assumptions used in the models which are comparable to the prior year are as follows: Input Assumption Share price Price at date of grant Exercise price Per scheme rules Expected volatility 25% 55% Option life Per scheme rules Expected dividends Based on historic dividend yield Risk free interest rate 0.8% 1.5% Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.
Volatility is calculated by looking at the historical share price movements prior to the date of grant over a period of time commensurate with the remaining term for each award.
The Group recognised total expenses of 5.1m FY15: 4.2m related to equity-settled sharebased payment transactions.
Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for all UK employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the scheme within two years of joining and they choose to take a refund, the contributions paid by the Group are forfeited by the employee.
In addition to the scheme in the UK, the Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for USA employees.
The total cost charged to income of 3.4m FY15: 2.4m represents contributions payable to the schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes.
At 31 March 2016, contributions of 311,000 FY15: 202,000 due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
150 | HomeServe plc Financial statements Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Notes to financial statements Defined benefit scheme The Group participates in a defined benefit scheme, the Water Companies Pension Scheme, which is closed to new members.
This is a sectionalised scheme and the Group participates in the HomeServe plc Section of the Scheme.
The Section is administered by a Trustee and is independent of the Groups finances.
Contributions are paid to the Section in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuary.
The results of the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2014 were updated to the accounting date by a qualified independent actuary in accordance with IAS19.
Remeasurements are recognised immediately through other comprehensive income.
Valuation at 2016 2015 Key assumptions used: Discount rate at 31 March 3.5% 3.3% Consumer price inflation 2.2% 2.3% Retail price inflation 3.2% 3.3% Expected rate of salary increases 2.2% 2.3% Future pension increases 2.2% 2.3% Life expectancy of female aged 60 at balance sheet date 29.7yrs 29.6yrs Life expectancy of male aged 60 at balance sheet date 27.8yrs 27.7yrs Pensions accounting entries are subject to judgement and volatility, as the assets are largely linked to the equity market, whereas the present value of the obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds.
As an indication, all other things being equal: an increase in the discount rate of 0.1% would lead to a reduction in the value placed on the obligations of the Section of approximately 0.5m an increase in the inflation assumption rate of 0.1% would lead to an increase in the value placed on the obligations of the Section of approximately 0.5m an increase of life expectancy of 1 year would lead to an increase in the value placed on the obligations of the Section of approximately 0.7m.
Amounts recognised in income in respect of the defined benefit scheme are as follows: 2016 2015 m m Current service cost 0.2 0.1 Interest cost Recognised in operating costs 0.2 0.1 The actual return on scheme assets was a loss of 1.5m FY15: profit of 2.6m.
