The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in associates.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 13 June 2016.
PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As a result of the relative size and volatility of the cash-settled share incentive scheme charges it has been decided to separately disclose the amounts on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In the prior year, as a result of the significant fall in the Companys share price, the share incentive scheme charge unusually became a credit due to the required revaluation of certain share incentives at year end.
The item returned to being a significant charge in the current year and therefore separate disclosure continues to be deemed appropriate in order to provide a clearer understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
In view of the size and nature of the charge as a non-cash item, the amortisation of intangible assets has also been separately disclosed on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period.
More information regarding the intangible asset is set out in note 6 of these financial statements.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Statement of compliance The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as endorsed by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
b Basis of preparation The Companys business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 36.
The financial position of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 21 to 25 and within notes 12 and 19 to the financial statements.
In addition, notes 15 and 19 include the Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Under the revised energy supply arrangements which were effective from 1 December 2013, Npower continues to be responsible for funding the principal working capital requirements relating to the supply of energy to the Companys Members.
This includes funding the Budget Plans of Members who pay for their energy in equal monthly instalments and pre-funding the payment of certain energy network charges.
The Company has from Barclays Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC total revolving credit facilities of 150.0 million for the period to 14 December 2020 of which only 71.2 million was drawn down as at 31 March 2016.
The Company has considerable financial resources together with a large and diverse retail and small business membership base and long term contracts with a number of key suppliers.
As a consequence, the directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks.
On this basis the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The annual financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the FRCs Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009 issued in October 2009.
94 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED b Basis of preparation continued Critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described below, the Directors have made judgements, estimations and assumptions regarding the future.
The judgements, estimations, and assumptions that have the most significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are detailed below.
Estimates and judgements are evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
In future, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
i Revenue recognition Revenue relating to the sale of energy includes an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end.
This will have been estimated by using historical consumption patterns, prevailing weather data and other industry information.
Whilst the estimation routines are currently considered appropriate, a significant change in historical consumption patterns and or a failure to maintain the accuracy of the estimation routines could impact the amount of revenue recognised.
ii Intangible assets The Group intangible assets relate to the entering into of the energy supply arrangements with Npower on improved commercial terms through the acquisition by the Company of Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited from Npower Limited having effect from 1 December 2013.
The valuation of intangible assets represents a significant area of judgment as certain key assumptions are required in relation to the future financial performance of the assets.
Further detail regarding intangible assets is set out in note 6. iii Trade receivables Trade receivables largely represent customers who have energy debt assigned to a prepayment meter, or are in the process of having such a meter installed.
This requires the Directors to make estimates and judgements as to the expected level of eventual debt recovery from these customers based on historical experience.
While the provisions are currently considered to be appropriate, changes in estimation basis or in economic and regulatory conditions could lead to a change in the level of provisions recorded and consequently on the charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income.
iv Share incentive scheme charges The Group has a conventional share option scheme and a Joint Share Ownership Plan JSOP for employees and Directors.
The fair value of share options is estimated by using the Binomial valuation model on the date of grant based on certain assumptions.
The fair value of JSOP awards is also estimated using the Binomial valuation model, however, as a cash-settled award the valuation is conducted at each reporting period end.
The assumptions used in the valuations are described in note 18 and include, amongst others, the dividend yield, expected volatility, expected life of the options and number of options expected to vest.
By virtue of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from presenting a statement of comprehensive income.
The Company made a profit for the year of 54,389,000 2015: 31,464,000, including dividends received from subsidiary companies of 20,000,000 2015: Nil.
The following standards and interpretations have become mandatory for the Group during the current accounting period, but where relevant to the Group they have not had a material impact on the financial statements: Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 95 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries The Groups financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Telecom Plus PLC and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control transfers to the Group and are included until the date on which the Group ceases to control them.
Control is recognised where an investor is expected to receive, or has rights to, variable returns from its investment in the investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the relevant activities of the investee.
Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
ii Associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate are not recognised.
iii Employee Benefit Trusts In accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities of employee benefit trusts are consolidated in the Group financial statements.
Employee benefit trusts are treated as a legal entity separate from the Company but as subsidiaries of the Company.
Any loans made by the Company to employee benefit trusts are accounted for as loans in accordance with the relevant terms.
When the trust transfers shares to employees to satisfy share incentive scheme awards, this is considered to be, in substance, two transactions: a distribution of the shares from the employee benefit trust back to the Company as treasury shares, followed by a distribution of those shares to the employees.
d Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for in accordance with the guidance set out in IFRS 3 Business Combinations IFRS 3.
An analysis of whether any subsidiaries acquired constitute businesses in their own right is initially undertaken with reference to the guidance in IFRS 3.
Where an acquired subsidiary does not constitute a business under IFRS 3 i. e. it does not have, inter alia, the inputs, processes and outputs to function on a standalone basis the acquisition of the subsidiary is treated as an acquisition of assets.
The assets acquired are recorded at cost and no goodwill is recognised.
Transaction costs are capitalised as part of the cost of acquisition.
Where an acquired subsidiary constitutes a business under IFRS 3, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the fair value of consideration over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and any impairment is recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
96 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED e Revenue Overview Revenue is the value of goods and services supplied to external customers and independent distributors excluding value added tax and other sales related taxes.
For each of the Groups main income streams from the provision of fixed line telephony, broadband, mobile telephony, gas and electricity services, transactions are recorded as sales in the month when the provision of those services or the supply of goods takes place.
The Groups customers are invoiced in the month following that in which the services are provided.
The Group also generates revenue as a result of providing bill payment protection and accidental death cover to customers for a monthly fee.
The Group does not retain the insurance risk for these services.
Tariffs are set by Member, by service, and these can vary depending on the number of services provided.
Each element of any package is priced independently to arrive at the total package price.
Revenue recognition Energy services The recognition of revenue associated with the provision of gas and electricity services to customers by the Group relies on estimates of usage where meter readings are not available.
These estimates are based on historical usage information adjusted for known factors such as variations in weather.
Revenue is recognised during the period in which the services are supplied and any unbilled revenue is accrued at each period end.
Revenue recognition Telephony services The Group principally generates revenue from providing the following telecommunications services: i fixed telephony line rental, call and broadband data charges: and ii mobile telephony call and data charges, and mobile handset sales.
Revenue for mobile handset sales are recognised when the devices are delivered to the end customer and the sale is considered complete.
Revenue recognition Other services The Group also generates revenues from providing Members with bill protection cover, and CashBack cards.
In addition the Group generates revenues from providing services to its network of independent distributors.
f Interest income Interest income is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as it accrues, using the effective interest rate method.
g Leases Payments on operating leases are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
h Hire purchase agreements Hire purchase agreements relate to leases of assets where the Group has passed on substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and are therefore classified as finance leases.
When assets are leased out under finance leases, the present value of the minimum lease payments is recognised as a receivable.
i Taxation The tax charge for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Taxation is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 97 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Deferred tax is recognised, based on the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
j Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less a provision for depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost less estimated residual value of the assets in equal instalments over their expected useful lives.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided on other assets at the following rates: Freehold buildings 50 years Freehold and leasehold improvements 3 to 25 years Plant and machinery 15 years Fixtures, fittings and office equipment - Fixtures and fittings 7 to 10 years - Computer and office equipment 3 to 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that they may be impaired.
k Investment properties Investment properties are properties which are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both.
Investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Rental income from investment properties is accounted for on an accruals basis.
l Intangible assets Intangible assets which arise e. g. on the entering into of significant commercial contractual arrangements are capitalised and amortised over the shorter of their useful life and the term of any contractual arrangement or, where appropriate and an indefinite life is chosen, made subject to an annual impairment review.
m Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, representing the difference between the fair value of consideration and the fair value of the separable net assets acquired is capitalised and is subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
n Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
98 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED o Investments In the Companys accounts, investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are initially stated at cost.
Provision is made for any impairment in the value of these investments.
In the Group accounts investments in associated undertakings are shown at cost plus accumulated profits less any dividends received from the associated undertakings.
p Inventories Inventories principally include mobile telephones and other electronic equipment and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is measured on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
q Financial instruments The Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Financial instruments are recognised on the trade date when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of a financial instrument not at fair value through profit and loss, transactions costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial instrument.
Financial instruments are derecognised on the trade date when the Group is no longer a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
r Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash receipts over the short credit period is not considered to be material.
s Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits with banks and, for the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement, short term revolving credit facilities.
t Borrowings Short and long term borrowings comprise revolving credit facilities and bank loans.
The fees associated with entering into borrowing facilities are capitalised and netted off against borrowings and amortised over the term of the borrowings.
u Trade payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash payments over the short payment period is not considered to be material.
v Share based payments The fair value at the date of grant of share based remuneration, principally share options, is calculated using a binomial pricing model and is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income takes account of the estimated number of shares that will vest.
All share option based remuneration is equity settled, except as set out below.
The Company established a Joint Share Ownership Plan the JSOP on 30 March 2011.
On vesting, any gains made on awards granted under the JSOP may be settled at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee either through: i a cash payment to the participant equal to the gain: or ii the transfer of legal and beneficial ownership to the participant of such number of shares as have full value equal to the gain.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 99 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED JSOP awards are considered to be cash-settled and therefore a fair value liability is calculated using a binomial pricing model.
The fair value is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award.
At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive income.
w Segmental reporting Financial information on operating segments that corresponds with information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, Chief Executive Mr Andrew Lindsay, is disclosed in note 1 to the accounts.
x Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
y Pensions The Group makes contributions to certain employees personal pension plans.
These are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which they become payable.
z Dividends Final dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
aa New standards issued but not yet effective The Group has not yet applied the following standards and amendments as these are not yet effective in the consolidated Group financial statements and remain subject to endorsement by the EU: IFRS 9: Financial instruments, effective for the year ending 31 March 2019: IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers, effective for the year ending 31 March 2019: and IFRS 16: Leases, effective for the year ending 31 March 2020.
The following standards and amendments are not yet effective in the consolidated Group financial statements but have been endorsed by the EU: IAS 1: Presentation of financial statements, related to the disclosure initiative and effective from 1 Januar y 2016: Amendment to IAS 16: Proper ty, plant and equipment and IAS 38: Intangible assets, related to the clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation and effective from 1 January 2016: Annual Improvement Project 2010-2012, effective from 1 Januar y 2016: and Annual Improvement Project 2012-2014, effective from 1 Januar y 2016.
The Directors do not anticipate that the application of the Annual Improvement Projects and the Amendments to IAS 1, IAS 16 and IAS 38 will have a material impact on the amounts reported and disclosed.
In respect of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 exercises are underway to assess the impacts that these standards will have on the Groups revenue recognition, assets and liabilities.

SEGMENT REPORTING The Groups reportable segments reflect the two distinct activities around which the Group is organised: Customer Acquisition: and Customer Management.
Customer Acquisition revenues represent joining fees from the Groups distributors, the sale of marketing materials and sales of equipment including mobile phone handsets and wireless internet routers.
Customer Management revenues are principally derived from the supply of fixed telephony, mobile telephony, gas, electricity and internet services to residential and small business customers.
The Board measures the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and segment result, which is referred to as operating profit.
The Group applies the same significant accounting policies across both operating segments.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS 2016 2015 000 000 Group Cost At 1 April 224,563 224,563 Additions - - At 31 March 224,563 224,563 Amortisation At 1 April 14,971 3,785 Charge for the year 11,228 11,186 At 31 March 26,199 14,971 Carrying amount At 31 March 198,364 209,592 The Group intangible assets primarily relate to the entering into of the new energy supply arrangements with Npower on improved commercial terms through the acquisition by the Company of Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited the Companies from Npower Limited having effect from 1 December 2013 the Transaction.
The total consideration for the Transaction comprised a payment to Npower of 196.5 million on 20 December 2013, a deferred amount of 21.5 million payable on 20 December 2016 and a payment of 2.5 million made in January 2014 for the net assets acquired in the Companies which comprised cash and short term working capital balances.
The addition to intangible assets of 221.6 million in 2014 therefore represented the total consideration paid and payable to Npower, excluding the payment for net assets acquired in the Companies, plus certain transaction costs of 3.6 million which in accordance with the relevant accounting standards were recognised as a cost of acquisition.
The intangible asset is being amortised evenly over the 20 year life of the new energy supply agreement reflecting the period over which the Company will benefit from the agreement.
The Board regularly monitors the carrying amount of the intangible assets.
A review was undertaken at 31 March 2016 to assess whether the carrying amount of intangible assets was supported by their value in use determined by the net present value of the future cash flows derived from the assets using cash flow projections based on current levels of profitability.
A post-tax discount rate of 7.0% was used which was considered appropriate given the expectation that, for term of the contract, the Group will continue to derive significant value from supplying energy to its customers.
The result of the review undertaken at 31 March 2016 indicated that no impairment was necessary.
No reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in the impairment calculation would give rise to an impairment of intangible assets.

The Group regularly monitors the carrying amount of its goodwill.
A review was undertaken at 31 March 2016 to assess whether the carrying amount of assets was supported by their value in use determined by the net present value of the future cash flows derived from the assets using cash flow projections based on current levels of profitability.
A post-tax discount rate of 10% into perpetuity was used which was considered appropriate given the relatively small size of the business and the expectation that, for the foreseeable future, TML will continue to operate as a going concern.
However, no growth has been assumed in the review given the relative maturity of the business.
No reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in the impairment calculation would give rise to an impairment of goodwill.

CAPITAL AND RESERVES CONTINUED Capital management The Groups overall objective when managing capital is to continue to provide attractive returns to shareholders.
Total shareholder equity at 31 March 2016 was 198.3 million 2015: 196.3 million.
The Groups current capital management strategy is to retain sufficient working capital for day to day operating requirements.
In addition, as a result of the entering the energy supply arrangements with Npower in December 2013, and the consequent drawdown of transaction debt facilities, the Groups capital management strategy is also to ensure that interest costs are minimised.
Under the revised energy supply arrangements which were effective from 1 December 2013, Npower continues to be responsible for funding the principal working capital requirements relating to the supply of energy to the Companys customers.
This includes funding the Budget Plans of customers who pay for their energy in equal monthly instalments and pre-funding the payment of certain energy network charges.
Dividends 2016 2015 000 000 Prior year final paid 21p 2015: 19p per share 16,734 15,105 Interim paid 22p 2015: 19p per share 17,596 15,125 The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 24p per ordinary share totalling approximately 19.2 million, payable on 29 July 2016, to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 8 July 2016.

This dividend will be subject to income tax at each recipients individual marginal income tax rate.

Capital commitments At 31 March 2016 the Company had capital commitments of approximately 285,000 2015: 2,481,000.
Energy supply arrangements The Group entered into a 20 year energy supply agreement with Npower the SSA on 20 December 2013.
In the event that the SSA is terminated by Npower in certain circumstances, including on a material breach by the Group or on the insolvency of the Company, additional consideration of up to 191 million may become payable by the Company to Npower.
Full details of the termination provisions of the SSA were set out in paragraph 4 of Part VIII on page 38 of the prospectus issued to shareholders on 20 November 2013.
However, given the energy supply agreement termination rights are either, in the directors view, very unlikely to occur or entirely within the control of the Group, the directors believe the likelihood of this type of termination event is remote.
The amount of the additional consideration reduces from 191 million to 11 million over the remaining life of the supply agreement.
Furthermore, depending on the circumstances giving rise to a termination event, the additional consideration if payable may be spread over the unexpired term of the supply agreement.
Following any such termination event, the Group would have direct access to the wholesale energy markets and the opportunity to earn additional margin from sourcing energy directly for the Groups customer base.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Company has two share option plans, one of which is available to employees, the other to distributors of the Company.
The Company has also established a new Save As You Earn share option plan the 2015 Employee SAYE Share Option Plan for employees during the year.
All new employees who have passed the requisite probationary period are issued with market price options over shares in the Company, further options are also granted to existing employees depending on their seniority and length of service The Telecom Plus PLC 2007 Employee Share Option Plan.
The 2015 Employee SAYE Share Option Plan enables employees of the group to acquire shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner using monies saved from salary over a three or five year period.
A summary of the principal terms of the SAYE Share Option Plan were set out in the Appendix to the 2015 AGM circular sent to all shareholders.
The distributor scheme The Telecom Plus PLC 2007 Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan exists to provide incentives to the people who are most successful in gathering new customers for the Company.
As it is not possible to measure directly the benefit received from these activities, the fair value of the benefit received has been measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
On 30 March 2011 the Company established a new Joint Share Ownership Plan The Telecom Plus PLC Joint Share Ownership Plan 2011 or the JSOP.
Under the terms of the JSOP 500,000 shares were issued to an Employee Benefit Trust the JSOP Share Trust administered by Zedra Trust Company Guernsey Limited formerly Barclays Wealth Guernsey Limited.
On 30 November 2015 Andrew Lindsay, Chief Executive Officer, exercised his rights over the 500,000 ordinary shares previously jointly held with the JSOP Share Trust.
Under the rules of the JSOP, Mr Lindsay was entitled to receive any increase in the value of the 500,000 shares over the share price at the date of grant on 31 March 2011 of 4.55, plus an annual compound growth rate of five per cent which together equated to 5.71 per share on 30 November 2015.
In accordance with the rules of the JSOP, the Company elected to satisfy the exercise of Mr Lindsays rights under the JSOP by instructing the transfer of 247,362 of the 500,000 Ordinary Shares to Mr Lindsay, representing the value of the gain made on these rights at the closing market price for Ordinary Shares on 30 November 2015 of 11.31.
In the current year the share incentive charge relating to the JSOP was approximately 1,291,000.
In addition, approximately 1,507,000 of charges had been accrued as at 31 March 2015.
A reconciliation of movements in the numbers of share options for the Group can be summarised as follows: 2016 2015 Number Weighted Number Weighted average average exercise price exercise price At 1 April 2,269,104 991p 1,921,149 855p Options granted 1,176,001 999p 1,040,900 1,294p Options exercised 103,813 556p 231,895 407p Options lapsed expired 852,098 1,273p 461,050 1,405p At 31 March 2,489,194 916p 2,269,104 991p The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised during the year was 1,063.3p 2015: 1,329.0p.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Treasury activities take place under procedures and policies approved and monitored by the Board.
They are designed to minimise the financial risks faced by the Group which primarily arise from credit, interest rate and liquidity risks.
Carrying amounts of financial instruments All financial assets, which include cash, trade and other receivables and accrued income, are classified as loans and receivables with a total value for the Group of 169,444,000 2015: 158,593,000 and for the Company of 65,201,000 2015: 46,008,000.
All financial liabilities, which include trade and other payables and accrued expenditure, are held at amortised cost with a total value for the Group of 227,857,000 2015: 227,546,000 and for the Company 140,930,000 2015: 143,488,000. Credit risk All customers are invoiced monthly and approximately 90% pay by direct debit: accordingly credit risk in respect of trade receivables is considered low due to the large number of customers supplied, each of whom represents an insignificant proportion of total revenue.
The Company has a universal supply obligation in relation to the provision of energy to domestic customers.
This means that although the Company is entitled to request a reasonable deposit from a potential new customer who is not considered creditworthy, the Company is obliged to supply domestic energy to anyone who submits a properly completed application form.
Where such customers subsequently fail to pay for the energy they have used delinquent customers, there is likely to be a delay before the Company is able to eliminate its exposure to future bad debt from them by either installing a pre-payment meter or disconnecting their supply, and the costs associated with preventing such delinquent customers from increasing their indebtedness are not always fully recoverable.
The Group has identified specific balances for which it has provided an impairment allowance on a line by line basis across all ledgers, in both years.
No general impairment allowance has been provided in either year.
The allowance accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible: at that point the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off against the financial asset directly.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its day to day operations primarily through cash generated within the business.
Cash surpluses are placed on deposit with Barclays Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC at money market rates to maximise returns.
The Groups profit and equity for the current year will not be significantly affected by changes in the UK base rate of - 1% from current levels.
Commodity price risk The Group is not materially exposed to any fluctuations in commodity prices due to the nature of the agreements with wholesale providers of telephony and energy services and its ability to pass the effect of any such fluctuations through to its customers.
124 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 19.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Liquidity risk The Groups treasury management policies are designed to ensure continuity of funding.
Foreign currency risk The Group does not have any significant foreign currency exposure.
Interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are denominated in Sterling.
Receivables due after one year include 3,940,000 2015: 3,971,000 due mainly from distributors elements of which earn interest at varying rates above Base Rate.
Borrowing facilities At 31 March 2016, the Group had total revolving credit facilities of 150,000,000 2015: working capital facility of 35,000,000 and transaction loan facility of 70,000,000.
These facilities are available to the Group until 14 December 2020.
As at 31 March 2016 71,241,000 of the facilities was drawn down 2015: 70,000,000 transaction facility fully drawn down.
As at 31 March 2016 the Company also had letters of credit in place relating to certain energy distribution charges with a total value covered of 12,340,500 2015: 12,023,500.
The facilities are secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets of the Company and through a cross guarantee with the Companys subsidiaries Electricity Plus Supply Limited, Gas Plus Supply Limited and Telecommunications Management Limited.
Further details of the facilities are set out in note 12 of these financial statements.
Fair values There is not considered to be any material difference between the fair value of any financial instruments and their net book amount due to the short term maturity of the instruments.
