In 2012 13 we had recognised specific item charges of 85m and 58m against revenue and EBITDA respectively relating to this matter.
In 2014 15 we recognised revenue and costs 203m, being the prior year impacts of ladder pricing agreements with the UK mobile operators following the Supreme Court judgment.
In August 2014 the Competition Appeal Tribunal CAT handed down judgment on various appeals brought against a December 2012 Ofcom determination on the pricing of certain Ethernet products.
We disagree with the CATs judgment and have applied for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.
Ofcom had determined that BT had overcharged for certain services between 1 April 2006 and 31March 2011 and required BT to make repayments.
The CAT judged that BT should also pay interest on these amounts.
Together with a review of our regulatory risk position in relation to other historical matters, we recognised a specific item charge of 75m in 2014 15.
Impact of fair value adjustment to deferred revenue on acquisition of EE we recognised a fair value adjustment on the acquisition of EE which reduced the amount of deferred income in relation to its prepaid subscriber base by 70m.
The step down reflects the difference between the amount recorded by EE on acquisition and the fair value calculated on the incremental cost that a market participant would incur to take on the liability plus a reasonable profit margin.
This amount was released as a reduction to revenue in the period ended 31March 2016, reflecting the period over which EE provided the related service.
Acquisition, integration and financing costs relating to EE transaction costs of 96m 2014 15: 19m, 2013 14: nil and integration costs of 17m 2014 15: nil, 2013 14: nil were incurred relating to the acquisition of EE and debt financing fees of 8m 2014 15: 7m, 2013 14: nil were incurred arranging a 3.6bn acquisition facility.
Property rationalisation costs we recognised a 29m 2014 15: 45m, 2013 14: nil, charge relating to the rationalisation of the groups property portfolio.
