Additions to internally developed software in 2014 15 included interest capitalised at a weighted average borrowing rate of 6%.
Goodwill impairment review The group performs an annual goodwill impairment review, based on its cash generating units CGUs.
The CGUs that have associated goodwill are BT Global Services, BT Business, BT Consumer and EE, since acquisition on 29 January 2016.
These are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets, and to which goodwill is allocated.
Goodwill is allocated to the groups CGUs as follows: BT Global Services BT Business BT Consumer EE Total m m m m m At 31 March 2014 1,045 214 80 1,339 Exchange differences 59 6 65 At 31 March 2015 1,104 220 80 1,404 Acquisitions note 13 439 1,103 4,888 6,430 Exchange differences 49 3 52 At 31 March 2016 1,153 662 1,183 4,888 7,886 The amount of goodwill allocated to BT Business and BT Consumer relates to goodwill arising on the acquisition of EE and represents the expected benefit to each of these CGUs from the synergies identified.

Intangible assets continued Recoverable amount The value in use of each CGU is determined using cash flow projections derived from financial plans approved by the Board covering a three-year period.
They reflect managements expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance.
Cash flows are also adjusted downwards to reflect the different risk attributes of each CGU.
The value in use calculation includes a fourth year estimate which is held flat from the last year assumed in the financial plans approved by the Board.
Cash flows beyond the fourth-year period have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.
Discount rate The pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are derived from the groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the groups weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
The discount rate used in performing the value in use calculation in 2015 16 was 8.8% 2014 15: 9.3% for all CGUs.
Growth rates The perpetuity growth rates are determined based on the long-term historical growth rates of the regions in which the CGU operates, and they reflect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of that sector.
The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for the relevant markets.
None of the growth rates applied exceed the long-term historical average growth rates for those markets or sectors.
The perpetuity growth rate for BTGlobal Services was 2.3% 2014 15: 2.2%, 2.0% 2014 15: 2.0% for BT Business and BTConsumer, and 2.0% for EE.
Sensitivities There is significant headroom in all CGUs.
For BT Global Services, the value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU by approximately 6,900m.
Thefollowing changes in combination in assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to fall below the carrying value: reduction in the perpetuity growth rate from the 2.3% assumption applied to a revised assumption of no growth an increase in the discount rate from the 8.8% assumption applied to a revised assumption of 15% shortfalls in trading performance against forecast resulting in operating cash flows decreasing by 210m or more in perpetuity.
For BT Business, BTConsumer and EE no reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed the recoverable amount.
From 1 April 2016, the CGUs that have associated goodwill reflect the reorganisation as disclosed in Note 30.
