These options were subsequently exchanged for nil cost share options under the MSIP and it is the nil cost share options granted under the MSIP that are included in this table.
The original nil cost share options granted under the PSP are not shown 4 The market value per share at grant is equal to the exercise price of the option granted under the Old Mutual plc 2008 Sharesave Plan, which was set at a 20% discount to the average Old Mutual plc share price over a three-day period immediately preceding the date of invitation.
Within a period of five years of appointment to the role, the Group Chief Executive is required to build up a holding of shares in the Company equal in value to 200% of base pay, and the equivalent figure for other executive directors is 150% of base pay.
Unvested share awards or share options and vested but unexercised share options are excluded for the purposes of the calculations.
There is no requirement for executive directors to hold shares or share interests in the Company once they have ceased employment with the Group, other than in relation to the 12-month holding period applicable under the terms of the MSIP.
Bruce Hemphills, Ingrid Johnsons and Paul Hanrattys interests in Old Mutual plc shares are set out below.
Shares have been valued for these purposes at the price on 30 December 2016, which was 207.
3p per share, other than for Paul Hanratty, whose shares have been valued on 1 1 March 2016, the date preceding the date he ceased to be a director of the Company 182p per share.
