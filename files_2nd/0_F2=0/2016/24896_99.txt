Financial statements Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Notes to financial statements Valuation of acquisition intangible assets Acquisitions may result in acquired access rights and acquired customer databases being recognised as intangible assets.
These are valued using the excess earnings method, taking into account a number of key assumptions such as retention and net income.
In applying this methodology certain key judgements and estimates are required to be made in respect of future cash flows together with an appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash flows.
Impairment of goodwill and acquisition intangible assets The annual impairment assessment in respect of goodwill and acquisition intangibles requires estimates of the value in use or fair value less costs to sell of cash-generating units to which goodwill and acquisition intangibles have been allocated.
CGUs are aligned to the countries in which we operate.
As a result, estimates of future cash flows are required, together with an appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash flows.
The carrying value of goodwill is 247.7m FY15: 236.6m.
The carrying value of acquisition intangibles is 75.3m FY15: 70.9m.
Following the annual impairment review, no impairment charge has been recorded against goodwill or acquisition intangibles.
As set out in note 14, changes in respect of commercial outcomes around sales volumes, prices, margins and discount rates can impact the recoverable value.
Management do not believe that any reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions would produce an impairment in the forthcoming year.
