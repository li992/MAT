S. Dollar Ordinary Shares.
As a result of this the Board has sold out of treasury 1.4m U. S. Dollar Ordinary Shares at an average weighted premium of 3.03%.
Share Conversions The Company offers a monthly conversion facility pursuant to which shareholders may elect to convert some or all of their shares of a class into shares of any other class.

Dividends The Company pays dividends to shareholders equal to the cash income it receives less its running costs paid in that year, subject to the solvency test prescribed by the Law.
Distributions are made by way of dividends with respect to each calendar quarter.
Dividends are paid in the currency of the class of shares in respect of which the dividend was declared.
The Articles also permit the Directors, in their absolute discretion, to offer a scrip dividend alternative to shareholders when a cash dividend is declared from time to time.
In the event a scrip dividend is offered, an electing Shareholder is issued new, fully paid up shares or shares reissued from treasury pursuant to the scrip dividend alternative, calculated by reference to the higher of i the prevailing average mid-market quotation of the shares on the Daily Official List of the LSE over five trading days: or ii the NAV per share, at the relevant time.
The scrip dividend alternative is available only to those shareholders to whom shares might lawfully be marketed by the Company.
The Directors' intention is not to offer a scrip dividend at any time that the shares trade at a material discount to the NAV per Share.
On 21 December 2015, due to the prevailing discount at that time, the Board decided to replace the scrip dividend alternative with a Dividend Re-investment Plan DRIP, whereby shareholders have the option to re-invest their cash dividend in the Companys shares on an efficient basis.
The below table sets out the quarterly dividends paid by the Company that relate to 2016 performance: Dividend per Dividend per U. S.
