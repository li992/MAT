Tax Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that they relate to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
The Group uses the balance sheet liability method of accounting for income taxes.
Temporary differences arising from the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount on the balance sheet are used to calculate deferred tax assets or liabilities.
Deferred tax assets or liabilities are calculated using tax rates anticipated to exist in the periods that the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill: deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements, except for any deferred tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
com 121 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2016 tabular amounts only are in thousands of US dollars, except per share data 15.
Tax continued Deferred tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities and there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
The Company is incorporated in the IOM and is subject to a tax rate of zero percent.
No provision for IOM taxation is therefore required.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The Group charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit shown per the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 $ $ Tax recognised in profit Current tax Current year 28,546 6,992 Adjustment for prior years 4,414 172 32,960 6,820 Deferred tax Current year 10,452 2,415 Impact of change in tax rate 670 Adjustment for prior years 2,794 6,988 2,415 Total tax expense 25,972 4,405 Reconciliation of effective tax rate Profit for the year before tax 167,993 11,808 Isle of Man corporate tax rate 0.0% 0.0% Adjustment from prior years 4.3% 1.4% Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.3% 58.4% Effect of different tax rates of subsidiaries operating in other jurisdictions 10.8% 22.5 % Other 0.1% 0.0% Current years tax expense as a percentage of profit before tax 15.5% 37.3% The table above shows the reconciliation between the actual tax charge and the tax charge that would result from applying the standard IOM corporation tax rate to the Groups profit before tax.
The Groups profits are taxed at different rates depending on the country in which the profits arise.
The key applicable tax rates include the IOM 0%, UK 20%, USA 40%, Canada 27%, Austria 25%, Bulgaria 10% and Gibraltar 10%.
The effective tax rate for the year was 15.5% 2015: 37.3%.
The effective tax rate in 2015 was significantly higher than 2016 due to the impact of exceptional costs incurred by the business relating to the acquisition of Skrill which were either not tax deductible or arose in the parent company in the IOM.
The effective tax rate of 15.5% 2015: 37.3% on statutory profit before tax is higher than the effective underlying tax rate on adjusted profit before tax.
The adjusted underlying tax rate for the year is 11.9% 2015: 8.5%.
The future underlying tax rate will be influenced by the tax jurisdiction in which profits arise.
In line with the Groups transfer pricing policies, which we believe are aligned with the OECD Base Erosion Profit Shifting agenda, incremental profits of the Group are expected to arise primarily in the UK, Austria, Canada and USA.
Since these countries have higher mainstream corporation tax rates than the Groups existing underlying adjusted effective tax rate, we would expect a growth in profitability in 2017 to be accompanied by a higher underlying adjusted effective tax rate.

Tax continued Accounting for taxes involves some estimation because the tax law is uncertain and the application requires a degree of judgement, which authorities may dispute.
Liabilities are recognised based on best estimates of the probable outcome, taking into account external advice where appropriate.
We do not expect significant liabilities to arise in excess of the amounts provided.
As per prior years, a total liability of approximately $3,900,000 remains outstanding as at 31 December 2016 in relation to an ongoing investigation by the Canadian Revenue Agency CRA regarding Canadian withholding taxes which are deemed to have arisen on the relocation of assets to the IOM from Canada in the 2004 and 2005 taxation years.
This liability represents managements estimate of the maximum amount the Group is likely to be required to pay in respect of such withholding taxes and interest.
In addition, during 2016, a tax enquiry was undertaken by the German tax authority in relation to the 2007 to 2013 taxation years in respect of the Prepaid division, focusing mainly on transfer pricing.
The enquiry was concluded with an additional tax liability of $504,000.
Separately in 2016, the Austrian tax authority conducted a general audit of the Prepaid divisions Austrian tax affairs, covering the taxation years 2011 to 2013.
The audit was concluded before the year end, with an additional tax liability of $120,000.
The table below shows the movement on deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year.
As at 31 December 2016 Net balance Recognised in Business Deferred tax Deferred tax as at 1 January profit or loss acquisition Net asset liability $ $ $ $ $ $ Property, plant and equipment 788 10,502 9,714 9,984 270 Intangible assets 43,039 6,177 49,216 12,310 61,526 Carry forward tax losses 804 1,055 1,859 1,859 Deferred stock options 126 499 625 625 Others 1,109 1,109 1,109 Deferred tax 42,897 6,988 35,909 25,887 61,796 Of the $25,887,000 deferred tax assets, $15,458,000 arose in the same taxable entities or consolidated tax groups as deferred tax liabilities where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities.
The net deferred tax liability of $35,909,000 is therefore presented on the statement of financial position on a net basis with non-current deferred tax assets of $10,429,000 and $46,338,000 non-current deferred tax liabilities.
As at 31 December 2015 Business Net balance Recognised in acquisition Deferred tax Deferred tax as at 1 January profit or loss Note 25 Net asset liability $ $ $ $ $ $ Property, plant and equipment 325 5,315 4,852 788 759 1,547 Intangible assets 885 7,033 50,957 43,039 835 43,874 Carry forward tax losses 92 712 804 804 Deferred stock options 141 15 126 126 Deferred tax 793 2,415 46,105 42,897 2,524 45,421 Deferred tax assets for carry forward losses of $1,859,000 2015: $804,000 include $1,073,000 relating to tax losses in Paysafe Merchant Services Inc.
Under Canadian tax rules losses can be carried forward and offset against profits of the same company for a period of 20 years.
The losses first arose in 2015 and therefore any unused amounts may begin to expire in 2035.
The deferred tax in Others of $1,109,000 relates primarily to provisions made by the business, which under UK tax law will be deductible when utilised.
Recognition of this asset is based on profit forecasts which indicate that it is likely that taxable profits will arise in the periods in which the provisions are utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities on intangible assets of $49,216,000 are primarily represented by a $56,330,000 deferred tax liability on goodwill and intangibles arising on consolidation of Skrill and a deferred tax asset of $6,872,000 on intangibles arising on the acquisition of paysafecard by the Skrill Group.
The deferred tax liability arising on the acquisition of the Skrill Group is a non-cash item that will be released to the income statement as intangibles and goodwill are amortised or impaired.
However, the deferred tax asset arising on the acquisition of paysafecard by the Skrill Group will result in a cash tax saving of $6,872,000 as it is utilised.
