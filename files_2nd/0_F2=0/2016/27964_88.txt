Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2016 tabular amounts only are in thousands of US dollars, except per share data 4.
Significant accounting policies continued Future changes to accounting standards The Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The IASB issued IFRS 9 in November 2009, introducing new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets.
IFRS 9 was subsequently amended in October 2010 to include requirements for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and for derecognition, and in November 2013 to include the new requirements for general hedge accounting.
Another revised version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014 mainly to include a impairment requirements for financial assets and b limited amendments to the classification and measurement requirements by introducing a fair value through other comprehensive income FVTOCI measurement category for certain simple debt instruments.
IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Directors of the Group do not anticipate that the application of IFRS 9 in the future will have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Group's consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014, IFRS 15 was issued which establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
IFRS 15 will supersede the current revenue recognition guidance including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and the related Interpretations when it becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Specifically, the Standard introduces a five-step approach to revenue recognition: Step 1: Identify the contract s with a customer Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract Step 3: Determine the transaction price Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract Step 5: Recognise revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation Extensive disclosures are required by IFRS 15.
The Directors of the Group do not anticipate that the application of IFRS 15 in the future will have a material impact on the amounts reported and disclosures made in the Group's consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases In January 2016, IFRS 16 was issued which will replace IAS 17 as the standard for recognising, measuring, presenting and disclosing leases.
The standard provides a single lessee accounting model requiring the recognition of assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or if the underlying asset has a low value.
The standard will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
It is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of IFRS 16 until the Group finalises its detailed review.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of subsidiaries at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually and in the event of impairment indicators arising.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

Goodwill continued Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination.
The group of CGUs that benefit from the synergies correspond to the Groups operating segments.
The Group had the following balances by CGU: Payment Processing Digital Wallets Prepaid Group $ $ $ $ Cost Balance at 1 January 2015 205,339 205,339 Additions during the year 3,375 598,820 375,936 978,131 Foreign exchange 3,151 1,978 5,129 Balance at 31 December 2015 208,714 595,669 373,958 1,178,341 Additions during the year Note 25 10,701 10,701 Foreign exchange 21,511 13,412 34,923 Balance at 31 December 2016 208,714 584,859 360,546 1,154,119 Carrying amount As at 31 December 2015 1,178,341 As at 31 December 2016 1,154,119 The Group performs goodwill asset impairment tests at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill for a CGU might not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Key assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts are discount rates and EBITDA growth rates.
The values assigned to the key assumptions represent managements assessment of future trends in the e-commerce industry impacting the payment processing business and are based on both external and internal sources historical data.
The key assumptions were as follows: As at 31 December, 2016 As at 31 December, 2015 Payment Payment Processing Digital Wallets Prepaid Processing Digital Wallets Prepaid Discount rate 10.4% 12.5% 11.4% 16% 16% 16% Terminal value growth rate 1.35% 1.35% 1.35% 1.35% 1.35% 1.35% Budgeted EBITDA growth rate 5 years 5% 5% 5% 5% 5% 5% The discount rate is an estimate based on past experience and the expected average weighted average cost of capital.
Five years of cash flows were included in the discounted cash flow model.
A long-term growth rate into perpetuity was determined based on managements estimate of the terminal value growth rate in EBITDA, which management believed was consistent with the assumption that a market participant would make.
Budgeted EBITDA was based on expectation of future outcomes taking into account past experiences.
No impairment indicators were identified during the year ended 31 December 2016.
Management has identified that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.
The following table shows the amount by which these assumptions would need to change individually for the estimated recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount: Payment Change in percent Processing Digital Wallets Prepaid As at 31 December, 2016 Discount rate 27.9% 11.5% 5.8% Budgeted EBITDA growth rate 5 years 40 % 22 % 14 % www.
