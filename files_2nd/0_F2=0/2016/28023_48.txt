OVERVIEW GROUP PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 11.
EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust note 36, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to include all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two types of dilutive potential ordinary shares those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year: and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups Performance and Co-investment Plan and the deferred shares element of the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, to the extent that the performance criteria for vesting of the awards are expected to be met.
The weighted average number of shares and earnings used in the calculations were: 2016 2015 Number of shares millions For basic earnings per share 390.9 410.9 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares from share options 1.8 1.8 For diluted earnings per share 412.7 392.7 BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Earnings per ordinary share before non-underlying items and deferred tax are presented as the Directors believe that this measure provides a more useful comparison on business trends and performance, since deferred tax reflects distortive effects of changes in corporation tax rates and the level of long-term capital investment.
