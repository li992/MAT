NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 32.
STRUCTURED ENTITIES continued The main types of activities for which the Group utilises unconsolidated structured entities cover synthetic credit default swaps for managed investment funds including specialised principal finance funds, portfolio management purposes, structured finance and asset backed securities.
These are detailed as follows: Principal finance fund: the Groups exposure to Principal Finance funds represents committed or invested capital in unleveraged investment funds, primarily investing in pan-Asian infrastructure, real estate and private equity Portfolio management: for the purposes of portfolio management, the Group purchased credit protection via synthetic credit default swaps from note-issuing structured entities.
The referenced assets remain on the Groups balance sheet as they are not assigned to these structured entities.
The Group continues to own or hold all of the risks and returns relating to these assets.
The credit protection obtained from the regulatory-compliant securitisation only serves to protect the Group against losses upon the occurrence of eligible credit events and the underlying assets are not fide-recognised from the Group balance sheet.
The Group does not hold any equity interests in the structured entities, but may hold an insignificant amount of the issued notes for market making purposes.
This is disclosed in the ABS section below.
The proceeds of the notes issuance are typically held as cash collateral in Issuers account operated by a Trustee or invested in AAA-rated Government-backed securities to collateralise the structured entities swap obligations to the Group, and to repay the principal to investors atmaturity.
The structured entities reimburse the Group on actual losses incurred, through the use of the cash collateral or realisation of the collateral security.
Correspondingly, the structured entities write down the notes issued by an equal amount of the losses incurred, in reverse order of seniority.
All funding is committed for the life of these vehicles and the Group has no indirect exposure in respect of the vehicles liquidity position.
The Group has reputational risk in respect of certain portfolio management vehicles and investment funds either because theGroup is the arranger and lead manager or because the structured entities have Standard Chartered branding Structured finance: structured finance comprises interests in transactions that the Group or, more usually, a customer has structured, using one or more structured entities, which provide beneficial arrangements for customers.
The Groups exposure primarily represents the provision of funding to these structures as a financial intermediary, for which it receives a lenders return.
The transactions largely relate to the provision of aircraft leasing and ship finance Asset backed securities: the Group also has investments in asset backed securities issued by third-party structured entities as set out on page 169 of the Risk review and Capital review.
For the purpose of market marking and at the discretion of the ABS trading desk, the Group may hold an immaterial amount of debt securities $2.5 million at year end from structured entities originated by Credit portfolio management.
This is disclosed in the ABS column above 33.
