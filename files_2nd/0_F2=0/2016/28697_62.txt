Market based performance criteria are taken into account when determining the fair value at the date of grant.
Non-market based performance criteria are taken into account when estimating the number of shares expected to vest.
The fair value of share based remuneration is determined by use of a binomial or Monte Carlo simulation model as appropriate.
All of the Groups share based remuneration is equity settled.
The Group provides a number of share based remuneration schemes to Directors and employees.
The principal share based remuneration schemes are the Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS, the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Retention Share Plan RSP and the Bonus Investment Plan BIP.
The last and final tranche of awards under the Reed Elsevier Growth Plan REGP was made in 2013 which vested in 2015.
No further awards are outstanding under this plan.
Share options granted under ESOS are exercisable after three years and up to 10 years from the date of grant at a price equivalent to the market value of the respective shares at the date of grant.
Conditional shares granted under LTIP, RSP and BIP are exercisable after three years for nil consideration if conditions are met.
Other awards principally relate to all employee share based saving schemes in the UK and the Netherlands.
Share based remuneration awards are, other than upon retirement or in exceptional circumstances, subject to the condition that the employee remains in employment at the time of exercise.
Conditional shares granted under LTIP, REGP, RSP and BIP between 2013 and 2016 are subject to the achievement of growth targets ofadjusted earnings per share measured at constant exchange rates as well as the achievement of a targeted percentage return on invested capital of the Group.
LTIP grants between 2013 and 2016, REGP grants in 2013 and RSP grants in 2014 are also variable subject to the achievement ofa total shareholder return performance target.
The weighted average fair value per award is based on full vesting on achievement of non-market-related performance conditions and stochastic models for market-related components.
The conditional shares and option awards are recognised in the income statement over the vesting period, being between three and five years, on the basis of expected performance against the non-market-related conditions, with the fair value related to market-related components unchanging.
