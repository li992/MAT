19 Share-based payments Fidessa has share plans whereby employees are granted awards over ordinary shares that are subject to the vesting terms of each plan.
The PSP, DABP and MSPP were approved by shareholders at the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
Each plan was approved by 99% of the votes cast and no votes were withheld.
The MSPP and, in the UK, the award of matching shares under the SIP were implemented in 2012 and are relevant to the majority of employees.
The first award under the DABP was made in 2012 and the first award under the PSP was made in 2014.
These plans replaced the CSOP, EGRIP and SBP from which the last awards were in 2010.
The final awards from the CSOP expire in 2017.
Performance Share Plan PSP This is structured as a grant of conditional shares with a zero exercise price.
The maximum for an employee in any year are awards over shares with a total market value of 500,000.
The vesting period is four years from the date of grant.
The adjustment to basic earnings per share adds back the post-tax amortisation charge for acquisition intangibles to the profit attributable to owners.
In both 2016 and 2015, the adjustment amounted to 584,000 and the adjusted basic earnings per share for 2016 was 95.0p 2015: 79.2p.
The awards vest based on the satisfaction of an earnings per share growth performance condition, which requires the cumulative four year adjusted basic earnings per share to be greater than the equivalent total achieved by applying the annual growth rates in the table below to the base earnings per share year preceding date of grant.
At the lower threshold, 25% of an award vests with a straight-line scale to 100% vesting at the higher threshold.
Fidessa group plc 83 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 19 Share-based payments continued Compound annual growth in EPS % of award vesting Less than 8% 0% 8% 25% Between 8% and 15% Between 25% and 100% Greater than 15% 100% In addition to the earnings per share based performance condition, in the event that the total shareholder return is below that of the FTSE techMARK Index over the performance period, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to scale back awards if it feels the level of vesting based on the earnings per share performance is, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, inappropriate.
The awards have to be called for by an employee normally within three years of vesting, thereby giving a maximum seven years life from grant.
However, in some jurisdictions the awards have to be exercised on vesting.
The shares can be satisfied by either new issue or market purchases.
A clawback provision applies to the plan for reasons of financial misstatement.
The PSP allows early vesting where a participants employment ceases due to death, injury, disability, the participants employer no longer being part of the Fidessa group or the Remuneration Committee so decides due to a reason similar in nature to those stated.
Pro-rating rules apply to restrict the number of shares in early vesting situations.
The duration of the plan is 10 years from approval at the 2011 Annual General Meeting and a mid-term review took place in 2016.
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DABP Under Part A of this plan, participants receive a proportion of their annual bonus in the form of deferred shares instead of cash.
Under Part B of this plan, participants are only eligible to receive a one-off conditional award to acquire shares on or shortly following their joining Fidessa.
The market value of shares over which a Part B award is granted may not exceed 200% of annual salary.
The shares vest to the employee after three years subject to continued employment with Fidessa through the period and, in the case of Part B, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions applied by the Remuneration Committee.
The DABP allows early vesting where a participants employment ceases due to death, injury, disability, the participants employer no longer being part of the Fidessa group or the Remuneration Committee so decides due to a reason similar in nature to those stated.
Share Incentive Plan SIP The plan is only available to participants who are resident in the UK for tax purposes due to the tax incentives associated with the SIP.
Relevant employees are able to purchase up to 125 per month.
Trust purchases of shares take place once a month and after three years an equal number of matching free shares are applied so long as there is continued employment throughout.
In the event that a participant ceases to be a Fidessa employee prior to the third anniversary of each purchase the matching shares that have not yet reached their third anniversary of purchase are forfeited.
Fidessa group plc 84 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 19 Share-based payments continued Monthly Share Purchase Plan MSPP The MSPP follows principles similar to the UK tax approved SIP and applies to the majority of employees across multiple countries.
The MSPP operates alongside the SIP in the UK with the MSPP being used for any higher levels of monthly purchase.
Employees are able to purchase up to a set value of shares each month into a trust.
Trust purchases of shares take place once a month and in September of the third calendar year following the employees contribution an equal number of matching free shares are applied so long as there has been continued employment throughout.
The MSPP allows early vesting where a participants employment ceases due to death, injury, disability, the participants employer no longer being part of the Fidessa group or the Board so decides due to a reason similar in nature to those stated.
Company Share Option Plan 2006 CSOP This plan was introduced in 2006 and the last grant was made in 2010.
Market price share options granted under this plan are subject to a performance condition that requires the cumulative four year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be greater than the equivalent total achieved by applying an annual growth rate of 5% to the adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year preceding grant.
Dilution limits The total permitted dilution across the PSP, DABP, MSPP and SIP is 10% in the 10 years commencing 6th May 2011 or 7% in the first five years of operation of these plans.
In addition, the potential dilution from awards granted in a calendar year cannot exceed 1.6%.
As at 31st December 2016 the maximum potential dilution from awards granted across these plans to date is 2.1%.
The total permitted dilution under the CSOP was 8% during the life of the plan: as at 31st December 2016 the maximum potential dilution is 3.5%, with the outstanding share options element of this representing 0.2%.
Fair values and awards outstanding All share plan awards are over ordinary shares.
The fair value of awards is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The expense is recognised equally over the time from grant until vesting.
For share awards under the DABP, MSPP, SIP and PSP the fair value has been measured using a Black-Scholes model.
The expected volatility was based on the historic volatility adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility.
The inputs to and output from the model are listed below: DABP Granted in 2012 Granted in 2013 Granted in 2014 Granted in 2015 Granted in 2016 Fair value 1645p 1941p 2517p 1934p 2333p to 2303p Share price at grant 1645p 1941p 2517p 1934p 2333p to 2303p Expected volatility 30% 28% 28% 28% 31% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividends per annum 3.8% 4.6% 4.6% 4.5% 4.0% Fidessa group plc 85 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 19 Share-based payments continued MSPP Granted in 2012 Granted in 2013 Granted in 2014 Granted in 2015 Granted in 2016 Fair value 1176p 1356p 1823p 1585p 1551p to 1505p to 1952p to 2283p to 2071p to 2286p Share price at grant 1305p 1554p 2088p 1801p 1824p to 1719p to 2160p to 2660p to 2435p to 2563p Expected volatility 30% 28% 28% 28% 31% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividends per annum 3.8% 4.6% 4.6% 4.5% 4.0% SIP Granted in 2012 Granted in 2013 Granted in 2014 Granted in 2015 Granted in 2016 Fair value 1330p 1587p 2089p 1791p 1876p to 1664p to 2262p to 2590p to 2405p to 2490p Share price at grant 1330p 1587p 2089p 1791p 1876p to 1664p to 2262p to 2590p to 2405p to 2490p Expected volatility 30% 28% 28% 28% 31% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividends per annum 3.8% 4.6% 4.6% 4.5% 4.0% PSP Granted in 2014 Granted in 2016 Fair value 1940p 1921p to 2126p Share price at grant 2555p 2415p Expected volatility 28% 31% Expected life 4-6 years 4-6 years Expected dividends per annum 4.6% 4.0% Awards under the CSOP subsisting at 31st December 2016 were: Options at Options Vested at 1st at 31st at 31st January Exercised Expired December Exercised December Remaining Grant year 2016 in year in year 2016 price p 2016 life 2009 93,284 91,584 1,700 1154p 0 years 2010 171,356 89,259 1,700 80,397 1421p 80,397 1 year For CSOP options exercised in 2016 the weighted average share price at the time of exercise was 2402p 2015: 2226p.
