Annual Report 2016 Great Portland Estates 133 1 Accounting policies continued Rental income This comprises rental income and premiums on lease surrenders on investment properties for the year, exclusive of service charges receivable.
Tenant leases The directors have considered the potential transfer of risks and rewards of ownership in accordance with IAS 17 Leases for allproperties leased to tenants and in their judgement have determined that all such leases are operating leases.
Lease incentives Lease incentives, including rent-free periods and payments to tenants, are allocated to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term or on another systematic basis, if applicable.
The value of resulting accrued rental income is included within the respective property.
Other property expenses Irrecoverable running costs directly attributable to specic properties within the Groups portfolio are charged to the income statement as other property expenses.
Costs incurred in the improvement of the portfolio which, in the opinion of the directors, are not of a capital nature are written-off to the income statement as incurred.
Administration expenses Costs not directly attributable to individual properties are treated as administration expenses.
Share-based payment The cost of granting share-based payments to employees and directors is recognised within administration expenses in the income statement.
The Group has used the Stochastic model to value the grants, which is dependent upon factors including the share price, expected volatility and vesting period, and the resulting fair value is amortised through the income statement over the vesting period.
The charge is reversed if it is likely that any non-market-based criteria will not be met.
Investment property Investment properties and investment properties under development are professionally valued on a fair value basis by qualied external valuers and the directors must ensure that they are satisfied that the valuation of the Groups properties isappropriate for inclusion in the accounts without adjustment.
The valuations of investment properties and investment properties under development have been prepared in accordance with the Global RICS Valuation Professional Standards January 2014.
For investment property, this approach involves applying market-derived capitalisation yields to current and marketderived future income streams with appropriate adjustments for income voids arising from vacancies or rent-free periods.
These capitalisation yields and future income streams are derived from comparable property and leasing transactions and are considered to be the key inputs in the valuation.
Other factors that are taken into account in the valuations include the tenure of the property, tenancy details, planning, building and environmental factors that might affect the property.
In the case of investment property under development, the approach applied is the residual method of valuation, which is the investment method of valuation as described above with a deduction for the costs necessary to complete the development, together with an allowance for the remaining risk.
Sales and purchases of investment properties are recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership transfer.
Trading property Trading property is being developed for sale or being held for sale after development is complete, and is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct expenditure and capitalised interest.
Cost of sales, including costsassociated with off-plan residential sales, are expensed to the income statement as incurred.

Depreciation is provided on plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Fixtures and ttings over three to five years.
Leasehold improvements over the term of the lease.
Joint ventures Joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method where, in the directors judgement, the Group has joint control of the entity.
The Groups level of control in its joint ventures is driven both by the individual agreements which set out how control is shared by the partners and how that control is exercised in practice.
The Group balance sheet contains the Groups share of the net assets of its joint ventures.
Balances with partners owed to or from the Group by joint ventures are included within investments.
The Groups share of joint venture profits and losses are included in the Group income statement in a single line.
All of the Groups joint ventures adopt the accounting policies of the Group for inclusion in the Group financial statements.
Income tax Current tax is the amount payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount inthe balance sheet.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deferred tax assets can be utilised.
No provision is made for temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit.
Tax is included in the income statement except when it relates to items recognised directly inother comprehensive income or equity, in which case the related tax is also recognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity.
Pension benets The Group contributes to a dened benefit pension plan which is funded with assets held separately from those of the Group.
The full value of the net assets or liabilities of the pension fund is brought on to the balance sheet at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are taken to reserves: all other movements are taken to the income statement.
Capitalisation of interest Interest associated with direct expenditure on investment and trading properties under development is capitalised.
Direct expenditure includes the purchase cost of a site if it has been purchased with the specic intention to redevelop, but does not include the original book cost of a site where no intention existed.
Interest is capitalised from the start of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The rate used is the Groups weighted average cost of borrowings or, if appropriate, the rate on specic associated borrowings.
Financial instruments i Derivatives The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency uctuations and interest rate risks.
The Groups derivatives are measured at fair value in the balance sheet.
To the extent that a derivative is a designated hedge and provides an effective cash ow hedge against the Groups underlying exposure, the movements in the fair value of the hedge are taken to equity.
To the extent that the derivative is not a designated hedge or does not effectively hedge the underlying exposure, the movement in the fair value of the hedge is taken to the income statement.
ii Borrowings The Groups borrowings in the form of its debentures, private placement notes and bank loans are recognised initially at fair value, after taking account of any discount or premium on issue and attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently, borrowings are held at amortised cost, with any discounts, premiums and attributable costs charged to the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
iii Convertible bond The Groups convertible bond can be settled in shares, cash or a combination of both at the Groups discretion.
The bonds have been designated at fair value through profit and loss upon initial recognition, with any gains or losses arising subsequently due to re-measurement being recognised in the income statement.
