Equity Share Capital 2016 2015 Number of 2016 Number of 2015 Ordinary shares of 1p each: shares 000 shares 000 Allotted, called up and fully paid 199,116,632 1,991 199,063,222 1,991 During the current period the Companys share capital increased by 53,410 shares 2015: no movement following the issue of shares in relation to the exercise of options under the Companys Sharesave Scheme.
There has been no significant impact on share premium as a result of the transaction, which has remained at 151.0m 2015: 151.0m.
In total the Company received proceeds of 2.7m 2015: 0.7m from the exercise of share options.
Potential Issue of Ordinary Shares The Company has three employee share option schemes, which were set up following the Companys flotation.
Further information regarding these schemes can be found in note 22 of the Groups financial statements.
Investment in Own Shares At 1 April 2016 the Company held in Trust 2,984,289 2015: 4,745,633 of its own shares with a nominal value of 29,843 2015: 47,456.
The Trust has waived any entitlement to the receipt of dividends in respect of its holding of the Companys ordinary shares.
The market value of these shares at 1 April 2016 was 11.7m 2015: 21.7m.
In the current period nil shares 2015: nil were repurchased and transferred into the Trust, with 1,761,344 2015: 271,569 reissued on exercise of share options.
Reserves The Company settled dividends of 32.4m 2015: 28.4m in the period, as detailed in note 8 of the Groups financial statements.
Included in the profit and loss account is nil of reserves that are not distributable 2015: 166.0m.
During the prior year, the Company received a dividend-in-specie, being a receivable due from another Group company, which was not expected to be settled in the near future.
As a result the value of the Companys investment in the IreCo 1 company wound up during the prior year fell below the amount at which it was stated in the Companys accounting records.
Schedule 1 to the Companies Act 2006, The Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 SI 2008 No 410 required that the investment be written down accordingly and that the amount be charged as a loss in the Companys profit and loss account.
However, the Directors considered that, as there has been no overall loss to the Company, it would fail to give a true and fair view to charge that diminution to the Companys profit and loss account and the cost of the investment of 280.3m was reallocated to the carrying amount of the holding Companys receivable.
Given that the receivable had a fair value of 328.3m, the Company recognised an unrealised gain of 48.0m through the Statement of Recognised Gains and Losses STRGL.
The effect of this departure was to increase the holding Companys total recognised gains for the financial year and the carrying amount of the receivable in the holding Companys balance sheet by 280.3m.
In the current year, the receivable of 280.3m recognised in the Company balance sheet as a result of the prior year dividend-in-specie was settled in return for another receivable with a Group company.
This resulted in the realisation of the 166.0m non-distributable reserves disclosed in the prior year accounts.

The total amount of guarantees in place at 1 April 2016 amounted to 3.9m 2015: 3.9m.
The Companys banking arrangements are subject to a netting facility whereby credit balances may be offset against the indebtedness of other Group companies.

Adoption of FRS 101 had no impact on the cash flows of the Company.
Investments Halfords Group plc issued loans to Halfords Holdings 2006 Limited and Halfords Finance Limited which attracted 0% interest.
The interest free element means that these loans are treated as a capital contribution and so the difference between the loan principal and a discounted market rate of interest 0.9m is capitalised as an investment in the entity.
An increase in retained earnings has also been recognised.
This adjustment reduced the previously reported Company profit by 0.5m in 2015 as the fair value adjustment unwound and was charged to the profit and loss account as an interest charge.
Intercompany balances The intercompany debtor and creditor balances have been reassessed and deemed to be repayable on demand, therefore aged as due within 12 months.
This adjustment had no impact on the profit and loss account as previously reported.
