Property is revalued annually using Level 3 inputs as defined in Note 2.

This resulted in an upward revaluation of The Old Bank by 0.1m during the year ended 31 December 2016 2015: nil.
Conquest House was valued by an independent valuation expert during 2015 with reference to the value of leasing a building of a similar size and with comparable facilities given the lack of similar buildings within the local area from which to determine a potential sale value.

It is not considered that the current total value of property is materially different from these valuations.
If carried at cost, property would be held at 5.2m 2015: 5.2m.
