Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies a Basis of preparation Basis of accounting The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for items that are required by IFRS to be measured at fair value, principally certain financial instruments.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee of the IASB, as adopted by the European Union adopted IFRS, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The Financial Statements set out on pages 99 to 154 have been prepared using consistent accounting policies, except for the adoption of new accounting standards and interpretations noted below.
No revisions to adopted IFRS that became applicable in 2016 had a significant impact on the Group Financial Statements.
These Financial Statements are presented in millions of Sterling rounded to the nearest one decimal place.
Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements set out the Groups financial position as at 31 December 2016 and the Groups financial performance for the year ended 31 December 2016, which incorporate the financial statements of Spectris plc and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and financial position, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 52.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 26 to 29.
In addition, Note 25 to the Financial Statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups net debt balance at 31 December 2016 was 150.9m 2015: 98.6m, with available undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 406.0m 2015: 371.1m.
The Board has reviewed sensitivity analysis on the Groups forecasts to 30 June 2018, the maturity profile of its financial facilities and liabilities Notes 16 and 26 and the ability of the Group to re-finance these obligations as they fall due.
The principal liquidity risk is mitigated through its financial risk management policies Note 25.
For the foreseeable future, the Board has a high level of confidence that the Group will have the necessary liquid resources to meet its liabilities as they fall due and will be able to sustain its business model, strategy and operations and remain solvent, including the impact of reasonable scenarios.
For this reason, it continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group Financial Statements.
There are no key sensitivities identified in relation to this conclusion.
Further information on the going concern of the Group can be found on page 40 in the Viability Statement.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted There are a number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2016 and have, therefore, not been applied in preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for the 31 December 2018 year end.
The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the results or Consolidated Statement of Financial Position reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers is effective for the 31 December 2018 year end and provides a single, principles-based, five-step model to be applied to all sales contracts, based on the transfer of control of goods and services to customers.
It replaces the separate model for goods and services of IAS 18 Revenue.
The Directors do not consider the impact of IFRS 15 to be significant on the sale of goods where revenue is currently recognised on delivery, or on contracts that involve a significant element of installation or testing of equipment.
The supply of goods, ongoing support, servicing and maintenance under these contracts that cover judgement will be applied when recognising revenue, although the year-onyear impact on profit is not considered to be significant.
104 104 Strategic Financial Report Governance Statements Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 1.
Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued IFRS 16 Leases was revised on 13 January 2016 and is effective for the 31 December 2019 year end and will require all leases to be recognised on the statement of financial position.
Currently, IAS 17 Leases only requires those categorised as finance leases to be recognised on the statement of financial position, with leases categorised as operating leases not recognised and expensed through the income statement.
The impact of IFRS 16 will be to recognise a lease liability and a corresponding asset in the statement of financial position for leases currently classified as operating leases.
The Directors are continuing to evaluate the full impact of the adoption of this standard.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management have made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Groups accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Information about significant areas where judgements, estimates and assumptions are required is included in the following notes: Note 11 Impairment of goodwill.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been tested for impairment by estimating the value in use of the cash-generating units to which it has been allocated.
Note 11 outlines the significant assumptions made in performing the impairment tests.
Judgement is applied in relation to the estimation of the provisional fair values and useful lives of acquired assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition.
Judgement is applied to assess the level of provisions required to write down slow-moving, excess and obsolete inventory to its net realisable value.
Notes 8 and 20 Taxation and deferred tax.
The assessment and recognition of tax provisions requires judgement.
Note 8 summarises the basis for that judgement being exercised in respect of tax matters.
b Summary of significant accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently by Group entities to all years presented in these Financial Statements.
Business combinations and goodwill The Group applies IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations for transactions arising after 1 January 2010.
This changed the Groups definition of the cost of business combinations and the treatment of contingent consideration.
The subsequent accounting for contingent consideration depends on whether this was initially recognised as equity or as a liability and whether the event is considered a measurement period adjustment.
Transaction costs on a business combination are expensed as incurred in the Consolidated Income Statement.
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method.
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration for the interests in subsidiary undertakings over the net fair value to the Group of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business is tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill is not amortised and any impairment losses are not subsequently reversed.
The net book value of goodwill at the date of transition to IFRS has been treated as deemed cost.
On the subsequent disposal or discontinuance of a previously-acquired business, the relevant goodwill is dealt with in the Consolidated Income Statement except for the goodwill already charged to reserves.
From 1 January 2004, goodwill is allocated on acquisition to cash-generating units that are anticipated to benefit from the combination.
Goodwill is tested for impairment by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates and comparing it against the net book value.
This estimate of recoverable amount is determined at each statement of financial position date and additionally when there is an indication that a cash-generating unit may be impaired.
The Groups identified cash-generating units are smaller than the reportable operating segments in Note 3.
The estimate of recoverable amount requires significant assumptions to be made and is based on a number of factors such as the near-term business outlook for the cash-generating unit, including both its operating profit and operating cash flow performance.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cashgenerating unit retained.

Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued Intangible assets and amortisation The cost of acquiring software including associated implementation costs, where applicable that is not specific to an item of property, plant and equipment is classified as an intangible asset.
Self-funded research and development costs are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which they are incurred unless development expenditure meets certain strict criteria for capitalisation.
These criteria include demonstration of the technical feasibility and intent of completing a new intangible asset that will be available for sale and that the asset will generate probable future economic benefits.
From the point where expenditure meets the criteria, development costs are capitalised and amortised over the useful economic lives of the assets to which they relate.
The Directors consider that, due to the nature of projects undertaken, the proportion of development costs incurred that meets the criteria for capitalisation is immaterial.
Intangible assets arising from a business combination that are separable from goodwill are recognised initially at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Other acquired intangible assets including software not specific to an item of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost plus any associated implementation costs, where applicable.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits, otherwise it is expensed as incurred.
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to administration expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straightline basis over the shorter of the estimated useful economic life determined on an asset-by-asset basis or underlying contractual life.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Software 3 to 5 years.
Patents, contractual rights and technology up to 10 years, dependent upon the nature of the underlying contractual right.
Customer-related and trade names 3 to 20 years, dependent upon the underlying contractual arrangements and specific circumstances such as customer retention experience.
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost comprises the purchase price paid and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use.
Tangible assets arising from a business combination are recognised initially at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Depreciation is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value which is reviewed annually, of property, plant and equipment over its estimated useful economic life.
Depreciation commences on the date the assets are available for use within the business and the asset carrying values are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that they may be impaired.
The depreciation charge is revised where useful lives are different from those previously estimated, or where technically obsolete assets are required to be written down.
Where parts of an item of plant and equipment have separate lives, they are accounted for and depreciated as separate items.
Estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold and long leasehold property and automotive testing tracks 20 to 40 years.
Short leasehold property over the period of the lease.
Plant and equipment 3 to 20 years.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset.
Inventories Inventories and work in progress are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Inventory acquired as part of business combinations is valued at fair value less cost to sell.
Cost represents direct costs incurred and, where appropriate, production or conversion costs and other costs to bring the inventory to its existing location and condition.
In the case of manufacturing inventory and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Inventory is accounted for on a first-in, first-out basis or a weighted average basis if deemed more appropriate for the business.
Provisions are made to write down slow-moving, excess and obsolete items to net realisable value, based on an assessment of technological and market developments and on an analysis of historical and projected usage with regard to quantities on hand.
106 106 Strategic Financial Report Governance Statements Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 1.
Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount which is considered a reasonable proxy for fair value, less provision made for impairment of these receivables.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the transactions.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the original carrying amount and the recoverable amount, being the present value of expected cash flows receivable.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in-hand and short-term deposits held on call or with maturities of less than three months at inception.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash equivalents for the purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are carried at the amounts expected to be paid to counterparties.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources, that can be reliably measured, will be required to settle the obligation.
In respect of warranties, a provision is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold.
Provisions are recognised at an amount equal to the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Groups liability.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability.
Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefit is probable.
Obligations arising from restructuring plans are recognised when detailed formal plans have been established and when there is a valid expectation that such a plan will be carried out.
Leasing Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises both current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case tax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years.
Deferred taxation is provided on taxable temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and their corresponding tax bases.
No provision is made for deferred tax which would become payable on the distribution of retained profits by overseas subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
Deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of intra-group dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.

Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued Foreign currency translation The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined with reference to the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date.
Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions are determined using the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates, and are charged credited to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
On consolidation, the Income Statement items of subsidiaries are translated into Sterling at average rates of exchange.
Statement of Financial Position items are translated into Sterling at year-end exchange rates.
Exchange differences on the retranslation are taken to the translation reserve within equity.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
All other exchange differences are charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which they arise.
On disposal of an overseas subsidiary, any cumulative exchange movements relating to that subsidiary held in the translation reserve are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Derivative financial instruments may be purchased to hedge the Groups exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates.
The accounting policies applied in these circumstances are described below.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are measured at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Financial instruments Recognition The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities on its Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Measurement When financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised they are measured at fair value, being the consideration given or received plus directly attributable transaction costs.
In determining estimated fair value, investments are valued at quoted bid prices on the trade date.
When quoted prices on an active market are not available, fair value is determined by reference to price quotations for similar instruments traded.
Originated loans and receivables are initially recognised in accordance with the policy stated above and subsequently re-measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Allowance for impairment is estimated on a caseby-case basis.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge risks associated with foreign exchange fluctuations.
These are designated as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, in the same line of the Consolidated Income Statement as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gain and loss previously deferred in equity is transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
108 108 Strategic Financial Report Governance Statements Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 1.
Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Derecognition A financial asset is derecognised when the Group loses control over the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset.
This occurs when the rights are realised, expire or are surrendered.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.
Originated loans and receivables are derecognised on the date they are transferred by the Group.
Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each Consolidated Statement of Financial Position reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset, or group of financial assets, is impaired.
A financial asset, or group of financial assets, is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset, or group of financial assets, that can be reliably estimated.
Net investment hedge accounting The Group uses Euro-denominated borrowings as a hedge against the translation exposure on the Groups net investment in overseas companies.
To the extent that the hedge is effective at hedging the variability in the net assets of such companies, caused by changes in foreign exchange rates, the changes in the value of the borrowings are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The ineffective part of any change in value caused by changes in foreign exchange rates is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Employee benefits The Group operates defined benefit post-retirement benefit schemes and defined contribution pension schemes.
Defined benefit schemes The Groups net obligation recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in respect of defined benefit schemes is calculated separately for each plan as the present value of the schemes liabilities less the fair value of the schemes assets.
The operating and financing costs of defined benefit schemes are recognised separately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Operating costs comprise the current service cost, scheme administrative expense, any gains or losses on settlement or curtailments, and past service costs where benefits have vested.
Finance items comprise the unwinding of the discount on the net asset surplus deficit.
Actuarial gains or losses comprising changes in schemes liabilities due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The amount of any pension fund asset recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is limited to any future refunds from the plan or the present value of reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Defined contribution scheme A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
In certain countries, the Group participates in industry-wide defined benefit-type pension arrangements.
In such circumstances, it is not possible to determine the amount of any surplus or deficit attributable to the Group and the pension costs are accounted for as if the arrangements were defined contribution schemes.
These are not material to the Group and, accordingly, no additional disclosures are provided.
Short-term benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued Share-based payments Certain employees of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions is determined by an external consultant and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each Consolidated Statement of Financial Position reporting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual outcome of awards which have vested.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
Where it is not possible to incentivise managers of the Groups operating companies with equity-settled options, they are issued with cash-settled options.
The charge for these awards is adjusted to reflect the expected and actual levels of options that vest and the fair value is based on either the share price at date of exercise or the share price at the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date if sooner.
Own shares Own equity instruments which are re-acquired own shares are recognised at cost and deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration paid to acquire such equity instruments is recognised within equity.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the right to consideration and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business to external customers net of returns and discounts, excluding value added tax and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
This is typically on delivery when legal title transfers to the customer.
If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount can be measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a reduction of revenue as the sales are recognised.
For contracts that involve a significant element of installation or testing of equipment, revenue is recognised at the point of customer acceptance.
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in proportion to the measurement of the stage of completion of services rendered as at the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date.
This is assessed by reference to the amount of time incurred in proportion to the total expected time to be taken to deliver the service.
Occasionally, the initial contract covers both the supply of goods and ongoing support, servicing and maintenance.
For such contracts revenue is allocated across each of the individual components in line with their relative value and each element is accounted for as described above.
Interest payable and receivable Interest payable comprises the interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest method and the unwinding of the discount factor on deferred or contingent consideration.
Interest receivable comprises interest income on cash and funds invested and is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as it accrues.
110 110 Strategic Financial Report Governance Statements Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 2.
Adjusted performance measures Spectris uses adjusted figures as key performance measures in addition to those reported under adopted IFRS, as management believe these measures enable them to assess the underlying trading performance of the businesses as they exclude foreign exchange movements and the impact of acquisitions.
Adjusted figures exclude certain non-operational items that are predominantly acquisitionor disposal-related items which management have defined as: amortisation and impairment of acquisition-related goodwill and other intangible assets: depreciation of acquisition-related fair value adjustments to tangible assets: acquisition-related costs and contingent consideration fair value adjustments: profits or losses on termination or disposal of businesses: unwinding of the discount factor on deferred and contingent consideration: unrealised changes in the fair value of financial instruments: gains or losses on retranslation of short-term inter-company loan balances: and related tax effects on the above and other tax items which do not form part of the underlying tax rate see Note 8.
During the year, the Group acquired Millbrook Group Limited, an engineering services business that owns a significant amount of tangible assets.
On acquisition, IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations requires tangible assets to be accounted for at fair value and as the book value of these tangible assets was lower than the fair value this has resulted in a significant fair value adjustment to increase the carrying value of the tangible assets Note 24.
In order for management to assess the underlying trading performance of the business, the additional depreciation charge due to the fair value adjustment on these assets above book value has been excluded from the adjusted figures.
The Board reviews and compares current and prior year segmental sales and adjusted profit at constant exchange rates.
The constant exchange rate comparison uses the current year reported segmental information, stated in each entitys functional currency, and translates the results into its presentation currency using prior years monthly exchange rates, irrespective of the underlying transactional currency.
Within the In-line Instrumentation segment, the BTG business has large functional currency mismatches against its underlying transaction currencies which distort like-for-like LFL comparison at times of significant currency movements.
Accordingly, BTGs LFL results are translated into Sterling by using the actual underlying transaction currency mix for determining transactional gains losses to provide more accurate and reliable information on BTGs underlying performance.
This approach has not been applied to any other operating company as BTG is the only business within the Group with a significant functional currency mismatch for LFL reporting purposes.
The Board reviews current and prior year segmental sales and adjusted profit at constant exchange rates excluding the incremental impact of acquisitions for the first 12 months of ownership from the month of purchase.
By removing the acquisition-related sales and operating profit, this allows the Board to assess the underlying trading performance of the businesses on a LFL basis.

Taxation continued The standard rate of corporation tax for the year, based on the weighted average of tax rates applied to the Groups profits, is -13.8% 2015: 25.4%.
The standard rate of corporation tax for the year is a credit due to the statutory tax rates applying to the impairment of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets.
In the absence of any impairment losses, the standard rate of corporation tax for the year, based on the weighted average of tax rates applied to the Groups profits, would have been a charge of 23.4% 2015: 25.4%.
The tax charge for the year is higher 2015: lower than the standard rate of corporation tax for the reasons set out in the following reconciliation: 2016 2015 m m Profit before taxation 31.9 141.6 Corporation tax credit charge at standard rate of -13.8% 2015: 25.4% 4.4 36.0 Non-deductible goodwill impairment losses 33.8 Non-taxable income and gains 4.1 3.6 Other non-deductible expenditure 3.6 1.3 Movements on unrecognised deferred tax assets 0.7 0.5 Tax credits and incentives 4.4 5.0 Change in tax rates 0.4 Adjustments relating to prior year acquisitions 3.1 Adjustments to prior year current and deferred tax charges 0.1 1.4 Total taxation 21.6 27.8 Tax credits and incentives above refers principally to research and development tax credits and other reliefs for innovation such as the UK Patent Box regime and Dutch innovation box regime, as well as tax reliefs available for manufacturing activities located in the USA.
Factors that may affect the future tax charge The Groups tax charge in future years is likely to be affected by the proportion of profits arising, and the effective tax rates, in the various territories in which the Group operates.

The Group is potentially subject to tax audits in many jurisdictions.
By their nature these are often complex and could take a significant period of time to be agreed with the tax authorities.
Judgement is therefore applied based on the interpretation of country-specific tax legislation and the likelihood of settlement.
Spectris estimates and accrues taxes that will ultimately be payable when reviews or audits by tax authorities of tax returns are completed.
These estimates include judgements about the position expected to be taken by each tax authority.
The Group applies judgement in respect of possible tax audit adjustments primarily in respect of transfer pricing as well as in respect of financing arrangements and tax credits and incentives.
In respect of transfer pricing, the level of provision is determined by reference to management judgements of the adjustments that would arise in the event that certain intragroup transactions are successfully challenged as not being at arms length.
Management estimates of the level of risk arising from tax audit may change in the next year as a result of changes in legislation or tax authority practice or correspondence with tax authorities during a specific tax audit.
It is not possible to quantify the impact that such future developments may have on the Groups tax positions.
Actual outcomes and settlements may differ significantly from the estimates recorded in these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Judgement is also applied relating to the recognition of deferred tax assets which are dependent on an assessment of the generation of future taxable income in the countries concerned in which temporary differences become deductible or in which tax losses can be utilised.
These estimates may change in the next year if there are changes in the forecast profitability of the relevant company.
The UKs dividend taxation regime prior to July 2009 is the subject of long-running litigation between HMRC and other taxpayers in relation to the tax charge on dividends received from EU-based companies.
The outcome of this dispute is likely to be relevant to the Group in respect of certain dividends received by UK Group companies before that date.
Pending resolution in the courts, a tax creditor of 12.6m 2015: 12.6m continues to be held for the potential tax liabilities arising if the final decision is made by the courts in HMRCs favour.
Within the tax charge is a credit of 3.1m 2015: nil relating to recognition of the net benefit of unused tax losses arising from the acquisition of Spectraseis AG in 2015.
The ultimate utilisation of these losses is now considered probable as a result of the post-acquisition restructuring of the business.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units that are anticipated to benefit from the acquisition.
The Groups identified cash-generating units are smaller than the four reportable segments, being the 14 operating companies.
Bolt-on acquisitions are quickly integrated into existing Group companies and are therefore not considered separately.
The most significant amounts of goodwill are as follows: 2016 2015 Pre-tax Pre-tax Goodwill discount rate Goodwill discount rate m % m % Omega Engineering 119.9 12.8 178.9 13.4 PANalytical 101.6 11.4 87.7 12.0 HBM 93.5 11.8 81.4 12.4 Brel & Kjr Sound & Vibration 87.7 11.2 63.4 11.9 BTG 68.5 11.1 49.3 11.8 Millbrook 54.1 12.1 Red Lion Controls 43.3 13.8 35.9 14.4 Malvern 36.1 10.8 32.2 11.5 Servomex 26.0 12.3 24.4 12.3 ESG Solutions 17.8 16.2 18.3 Other 23.6 13.113.8 15.5 12.715.4 654.3 584.9 Included within Other are four 2015: four cash-generating units, in which none of the goodwill balances are considered to be individually significant.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
As part of the annual impairment review, the carrying amount of goodwill has been assessed with reference to its recoverable amount, determined based on value in use.
In assessing value in use, the forecast projected cash flows of each cash-generating unit, which are based on actual operating results, the most recent budget for the next financial year as approved by the Board, detailed strategic review projections and an assumed long-term growth rate to perpetuity are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating unit.
The key assumptions on which the value in use calculations are based relate to future business performance over the forecast period generally three years, with the exception of Omega Engineering Omega where in 2016 four years is used, projected long-term growth rates and the discount rates applied.
The forecast cash flows include managements latest estimates on sales volumes and pricing, production and other costs.
The key judgements applied in the impairment review are the forecast level of revenue, operating margins and the proportion of operating profit converted to cash in each year.
A long-term growth rate of 2.0% 2015: 2.5% has been consistently applied in the impairment review for all cash-generating units based on current forecast global industrial production growth rates and long-term GDP growth rates for the Groups primary markets.
The cash flow projections have been discounted using cash-generating unit specific pre-tax discount rates of between 10.8% and 17.8% 2015: 11.5% and 18.3%.
These rates have been determined by taking into account the size of business and specific geographical and industry risk factors.
As a result of the impairment review, a total impairment charge of 114.3m 2015: nil has been recognised within operating profit in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of the Omega and ESG Solutions ESG businesses, as explained opposite.
126 126 Strategic Financial Report Governance Statements Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 11.
Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Omega Engineering An impairment charge of 94.4m 2015: nil has been recognised in respect of the Omega business, which forms part of the Industrial Controls segment, using the value in use basis.
The impairment charge is driven by the current years trading performance, primarily in Omegas largest market in North America, and lower projected cash flows within the budget and strategic review period.
This resulted in management reassessing the expected future business performance in light of the trading environment and the actions, and time required, to improve operational efficiency and profitability.
Accordingly, for the purposes of the impairment test, a four-year forecast period for Omega has been used 2015: three years, with a lowered long-term growth rate of 2.0% 2015: 2.5%, which is consistent with that used for all other cash-generating units.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are: sales: projected sales are built up with reference to market, geography and product categories.
They incorporate past performance, historical growth rates and market segment projections: operating margins: projected operating margins reflect historical performance, the net benefit from initiatives required to improve operational efficiency, and a continued focus on cost control: operating cash conversion: the proportion of operating profit converted to cash each year is based on historical performance and projected benefits from working capital management initiatives: and discount rate: this is calculated based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital and cash-generating unit specific risks, including the size of business and specific geographical and industry risk factors.
For the purposes of the impairment test, a pre-tax discount rate of 12.8% 2015: 13.4% has been used.
ESG Solutions An impairment charge of 19.9m 2015: nil has been recognised in respect of the ESG business, which forms part of the Test and Measurement segment, using the value in use basis.
The carrying value of goodwill has been impaired in full, with 1.0m of other intangible assets additionally impaired following the impairment review.
The impairment charge is driven by the continuing difficult external market conditions caused by low global oil and gas prices, which have adversely impacted demand from ESGs customers for its products and services.
This has resulted in management reassessing the expected future business performance based on external market data for the upstream oil and gas market of a recovery in the oil price in 2019.
For the purposes of the impairment test, a three-year forecast period has been used 2015: three years with a lowered long-term growth rate of 2.0% 2015: 2.5%, which is consistent with that used for other cash-generating units.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are: sales: projected sales are built up with reference to market, geography and product categories, with the key assumption being a recovery in the oil price in 2019, which is in line with external market data: operating margins: projected operating margins reflect historical performance, the forecast improvement in line with higher sales associated with a recovery in the oil price, and a continued focus on cost control.
The projections do not include the impact of future restructuring projects which are not yet committed: operating cash conversion: the proportion of operating profit converted to cash each year is based on historical performance and projected benefits from working capital management initiatives: and discount rate: this is calculated based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital and cash-generating unit specific risks, including the size of business and specific geographical and industry risk factors.
For the purposes of the impairment test, a pre-tax discount rate of 17.8% 2015: 18.3% has been used.
Sensitivity analysis The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent upon estimates and judgements, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
Sensitivity analysis to potential changes in the key assumptions has been undertaken based on the following sensitivities in isolation: a two percentage point pp increase in the pre-tax discount rate applied to each cash-generating unit: if the long-term growth rate assumption was reduced by 1.0pp to 1%: and if the cash flow projections for cash-generating units were reduced by 25% in each of the next two years.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued For each cash-generating unit, with the exception of Omega, the Directors do not consider that there are any reasonably possible sensitivities for the business that could arise in the next 12 months that could result in an impairment charge being recognised.
For Omega, based on current projections, reasonable possible changes in the key assumptions could cause the estimated recoverable amount to fall below the carrying value based on the sensitivity analysis performed, as shown below.
Since the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired in full for ESG, the business will no longer be subject to an annual impairment review as required under IFRS.
However, should future performance fall below current projections, the carrying value of the remaining net assets of the ESG business will be reviewed.
Increase in impairment charge Omega Sensitivities 2016 m 2pp increase in pre-tax discount to 14.8% 46 Reduction in long-term growth rate to 1% 31 Reduction in cash flow projections by 25% in each of the next two years 10 Millbrook Millbrook was acquired by the Group on 1 September 2016.
Given the proximity to the year end, the carrying value of goodwill has been assessed by reference to the value in use based on the acquisition business plan that assumed long-term growth rates in line with that anticipated for the rest of the Group and certain post-acquisition synergies.
These synergies include the benefit from leveraging the Groups wider customer base and sales and marketing channels and being part of a wider Group with shared support functions.
Given the assumptions built into the Millbrook acquisition business case, the Directors do not consider that there is a significant risk of impairment of the Millbrook acquisition goodwill arising in the next 12 months.
Other intangible assets Of the total amortisation charge of 42.4m 2015: 37.8m, the amount attributable to the amortisation of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 36.9m 2015: 33.0m.
The Group has no internally-generated intangible assets from development expenditure as the criteria for the recognition as an asset under IAS 38 Intangible Assets have not been met 2015: nil.
The trade names and technology assets recognised on the acquisition of Omega in 2011, and included within the Industrial Controls reportable segment, are considered significant by the Directors as they represent 43.9% 2015: 49.4% of total customer-related and trade names, and 20.0% 2015: 23.6% of total patents, contractual rights and technology, respectively.
The carrying amount of the trade name intangible asset at 31 December 2016 is 59.3m 2015: 51.3m and is being amortised over 20 years with the remaining amortisation period being 14.8 years.
The carrying amount of the technology intangible asset at 31 December 2016 is 17.3m 2015: 17.4m and is being amortised over ten years with the remaining amortisation period being 4.8 years.

Provisions continued Legal, contractual and other Legal, contractual and other provisions mainly comprise amounts provided against open legal and contractual disputes arising in the normal course of business.
The Company has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to protect its intellectual property rights, to enforce commercial contracts or otherwise and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent managements best estimate of the most likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is frequently uncertain, reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations.
Contractual and other provisions represent the Directors best estimate of the cost of settling current obligations although there is a higher degree of judgement involved.
The decrease in the provision during the year is due to a lower legal risk profile in the Group arising from specific matters.
Unless specific evidence exists to the contrary, these provisions are shown as current.
No provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against Group companies unless management, taking into account professional advice received, assess that it is probable that such proceedings may be successful.
Contingent liabilities associated with such proceedings have been identified, but the Directors are of the opinion that any associated claims that might be brought can be defeated successfully and, therefore, the possibility of any material outflow in settlement is assessed as remote.
Retirement benefit schemes Spectris plc operates funded defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for the Groups qualifying employees in the UK.
In addition, 14 overseas subsidiaries 2015: 12 in three overseas countries provide defined benefit plans.
Other UK and overseas subsidiaries have their own defined contribution plans invested in independent funds.
Defined benefit schemes The UK, German, Dutch and Swiss plans provide pensions in retirement, death in service and in some cases disability benefits to members.
The pension benefit is linked to members final salary at retirement and their service life.
Since 31 December 2009, the UK plan has been closed to all service accruals.
The German and Dutch plans are closed to new members.
The UK plan is administered by a pension fund, but the Swiss and Dutch plans are held by insurance companies that are legally separate from the Group.
The UK plan is managed by a board of trustees that represents both employees and employer, which is required to act in the best interest of the plans participants and is responsible for setting certain policies e. g. investment, contribution and indexation policies of the various funds.
The plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
Inflation and interest rate hedges are taken out to mitigate against risks arising on the UK plan and some reinsurance exists in respect of the overseas plans.
The overseas plans are funded by the Groups overseas subsidiaries, and the UK plan has been funded in the past by both the Groups UK subsidiaries and the Company.
The assets of the UK plan are invested in accordance with Section 40 of the Pensions Act 1995.
Although the Act permits 5% of the plans assets to be invested in employer-related investments, the trustees have elected that none of the plan assets are to be invested directly in Spectris plc shares.
The trustee also holds interest rate and inflation swaps to help protect against the impact of changes in prevailing interest rates and price inflation.
Trustee investment in derivatives is only made in so far as they contribute to the reduction of investment risks or facilitate efficient portfolio management and are managed such as to avoid excessive risk exposure to a single counterparty or other derivative operations.
The funding requirements are based on the individual funds actuarial measurement framework set out in the funding policies of the various plans.
The Group has determined that, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the defined benefit plans, and in accordance with statutory requirements including minimum funding requirements of the plans of the respective jurisdictions, the present value of the refunds or reductions in future contributions is not lower than the balance of the total fair value of the plan assets less the total present value of obligations.
This determination has been made on a plan-by-plan basis.
As such, no decrease in the defined benefit asset was necessary at 31 December 2016.
The last full actuarial valuation for the UK plan was 31 December 2014 and for the overseas plans was 31 December 2016.
Where applicable, the valuations were updated to 31 December 2016 for IAS 19 Revised Employee Benefits purposes by qualified independent actuaries.
The Groups contributions to defined benefit plans during the year ended 31 December 2016 were 1.9m 2015: 1.4m.
Contributions for 2017 are expected to be 2.3m for the overseas plans.
Contributions to the Spectris Pension Plan UK ceased from 1 July 2012.
The contribution rates are subject to review at future valuations and periodic certifications of the schedule of contributions.

Deferred tax continued Unrecognised temporary differences Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on the following temporary differences due to the degree of uncertainty over both the amount and utilisation of the underlying tax losses and deductions in certain jurisdictions.

It is likely that the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption such that no UK tax would be due upon remitting these earnings to the UK.
However, 68.2m 2015: 47.9m of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of the dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed 3.3m 2015: 2.3m, of which only 1.3m 2015: 1.0m has been provided for as the Group is able to control the timing of the dividends.
It is not expected that further amounts will crystallise in the foreseeable future.

The retained earnings reserve also includes own shares purchased by the Company and treated as treasury shares see Note 22.
The nature and purpose of other reserves forming part of equity are as follows: Translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation into Sterling of the Financial Statements of foreign subsidiaries, including gains or losses arising on net investment hedges.
Hedging reserve This reserve records the cumulative net change in the fair value of forward exchange contracts where they are designated as effective cash flow hedge relationships.
Merger reserve This reserve arose on the acquisition of Servomex Limited in 1999, a purchase satisfied substantially by the issue of share capital and therefore eligible for merger relief under the provisions of Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
Capital redemption reserve This reserve records the historical repurchase of the Companys own shares.
Treasury shares At 31 December 2016, the Group held 5,840,513 treasury shares 2015: 5,898,908.

Share-based payments The Spectris Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE provides UK employees with options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company following a three-year vesting period.
Options may be exercised during a six-month period following the vesting date.
The exercise price is determined according to the mid-market closing share price prevailing on the day before the date of grant.
There are no performance criteria associated with options granted under SAYE.
Under the Performance Share Plan PSP unapproved share options as defined by HMRC, the exercise price is the nominal cost of the Companys shares.
From 2014, awards to Spectris plc executives are subject to performance criteria: 33.33% of the award being based on fulfilment of an adjusted earnings growth target EPS, 33.33% of the award subject to a total shareholder return target TSR and 33.33% of the award being based on fulfilment of an economic profit EP target.
Awards to Spectris plc executives in the years up to 2013 are subject to performance criteria: 50% of the award being based on fulfilment of EPS and 50% of the award subject to TSR.
Awards to Spectris plc senior managers are still subject to this performance criteria.
Awards made to executives and senior managers of the Groups operating companies in 2008 and 2009 have performance criteria subject to EPS in respect of 50% of the award and operating company profit targets in respect of 50% of the award.
For awards made subsequent to 2009, the performance criteria are EPS in respect of 33.33% of the award and operating company profit targets in respect of 66.67% of the award.
Operating company manager awards up to 2013 were entirely subject to operating company profit targets.
All PSP awards vest after a period of three years and must be exercised during the seven-year period following vesting.
Since 2011, PSP options have also been granted to UK employees that are approved share options as defined by HMRC.
The performance criteria and vesting conditions are consistent with the unapproved options granted described above.
The approved share options are linked to the unapproved share options in order to benefit from the tax-exempt status of approved share option grants to an aggregate value not exceeding 30,000.
Should there be a gain on exercise under the approved options, such gain will cause a proportionate reduction in the number and value of the linked unapproved options.
Should there be no gain on exercise under the approved options, these options are then forfeited and the linked unapproved options may be exercised in full, to the extent their performance criteria are met.
From 2014, awards were made under the Restricted Shares Plan to selected employees.
Awards vest three years from grant and are cash-settled on vesting.
The Restricted Shares Plan is subject to the same rules as the PSP but gives flexibility as to whether or not awards are subject to performance criteria.
Awards under the Restricted Shares Plan may be granted to an employee of the Group, but may not be granted to an Executive Director of Spectris plc.

Acquisitions continued The assets and liabilities acquired from the above acquisitions, together with the aggregate purchase consideration, are summarised in the table below.
The revenue and operating profit contributions from the acquisitions in the year to the Groups results for the year were 28.9m and 2.1m, respectively.
Group revenue and operating profit would have been 1,381.5m and 39.2m adjusted operating profit: 204.9m, respectively, had each of these acquisitions taken place on the first day of the financial year.
Acquisition costs incurred and paid during the year relating to the above acquisitions were 2.5m 2015: 1.3m.
The following fair value table is provisional, reflecting the timing of the acquisitions, and is expected to be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date: 2016 Book value Adjustments Fair value Net assets acquired under 2016 acquisitions m m m Intangible fixed assets 1.5 43.6 45.1 Tangible fixed assets 29.1 29.7 58.8 Inventories 1.3 0.8 0.5 Trade and other receivables 17.0 1.3 15.7 Trade and other payables 14.5 14.5 Provisions 1.3 0.1 1.4 Retirement benefit obligations 2.3 2.3 Current tax 0.6 0.6 Deferred tax liabilities 1.1 14.4 15.5 Cash 6.9 6.9 Net assets acquired 38.3 54.4 92.7 Goodwill 81.5 Total consideration in respect of 2016 acquisitions 174.2 Total consideration 174.2 Adjustment for cash acquired 6.9 Net consideration in respect of 2016 acquisitions 167.3 Analysis of cash outflow in Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Total consideration in respect of 2016 acquisitions 174.2 Adjustment for net cash acquired on 2016 acquisitions 6.9 Deferred and contingent consideration on 2016 acquisitions to be paid in future years 7.6 Cash paid in 2016 in respect of 2016 acquisitions 159.7 Acquisitions prior to 2016 Purchase price adjustments relating to prior years acquisitions 1.4 Deferred and contingent consideration in relation to prior years acquisitions: accrued at 31 December 2015 2.6 Cash paid in 2016 in respect of prior years acquisitions 1.2 Net cash outflow relating to acquisitions 160.9 Where appropriate, a detailed exercise has been undertaken to assess the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the use of third-party experts.
The valuation of the above intangible and tangible assets requires the use of assumptions and estimates.
Intangible asset assumptions consist of future growth rates, expected inflation and attrition rates, discount rates used and useful economic lives.
Tangible asset including automotive testing tracks assumptions include comparable market values, replacement costs, expected rental yields and useful economic lives.

Acquisitions continued The fair value of contingent consideration on the 2016 acquisitions amounts to 7.6m.
The contingent consideration payable on non-financial milestones could range from nil to 6.4m depending on the achievement of certain business targets, contingent consideration payable on financial milestones could range from nil to 2.2m dependent on incremental future revenues and the total contingent consideration is sensitive to risk adjusted discount rates.
Due to their contractual due dates, the fair value of receivables acquired approximates to the gross contractual amounts receivable.
The amount of gross contractual receivables not expected to be recovered is immaterial.
0.5m 2015: 4.0m of the goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year is expected to be amortised and deductible for tax purposes.
There are no material contingent liabilities recognised in accordance with IFRS 3 Revised.

The additional depreciation charge due to the fair value adjustment on these assets above book value depreciation on these assets is an adjusting item in arriving at adjusted operating profit, as stated in Note 2.
A detailed exercise has been undertaken to assess the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for Millbrook.
The fair value of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment has been assessed by reference to work performed by independent valuation specialists.
The main judgements in the valuation of the intangible assets include the identification of existing customer relationships, the importance of the Millbrook trade name and the value attributed to specific technology.
In valuing these intangibles, a combination of the following estimates have been used: future growth rates, expected inflation rates, attrition rates, discount rates and contributory asset charges.
The main judgements in the valuation of tangible assets including the automotive testing track include comparable market values, depreciated replacement costs, expected rental yields and useful economic lives.

Financial risk management The Groups multinational operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
Financial risk management policies are set by the Board of Directors.
These policies are implemented by a central treasury department that has formal procedures to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk, including where appropriate, the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Group has clearly defined authority and approval limits.
The central treasury department operates as a service centre to the Group and not as a profit centre.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Such instruments are only used to manage the risks arising from operating or financial assets or liabilities or highly probable future transactions.
The quantitative analysis of financial risk is included in Note 26.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises both where sale or purchase transactions are undertaken in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of Group companies transactional exposures and where the results of overseas companies are consolidated into the Groups reporting currency of Sterling translational exposures.
The Group has operations around the world which record their results in a variety of different local functional currencies.
In countries where the Group does not have operations, it invariably has some customers or suppliers that transact in a foreign currency.
The Group is therefore exposed to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates between a number of different currencies but the Groups primary exposures relate to the US Dollar, Euro, Danish Krone, Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen.
Where appropriate, the Group manages its foreign currency exposures using derivative financial instruments.
The Group manages its transactional exposures to foreign currency risks through the use of forward exchange contracts.
Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge highly probable transactions which can be forecast to occur typically up to 18 months into the future.
The Groups translational exposures to foreign currency risks can relate both to the Consolidated Income Statement and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The Groups policy is not to hedge the translational exposure that arises on consolidation of the Consolidated Income Statement of overseas subsidiaries.
The Group finances overseas company investments partly through the use of foreign currency borrowings in order to provide a natural hedge of foreign currency risk arising on translation of the Groups foreign currency subsidiaries.
The quantitative analysis of foreign currency risk is included in Note 26.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both the interest rate price risk that results from borrowing at fixed rates of interest and also the interest cash flow risk that results from borrowing at variable rates.
Where appropriate, interest rate swaps are used to manage the Groups interest rate profile.
As at 31 December 2016, most of the Groups committed borrowings are at fixed rates of interest and therefore the Groups principal interest rate risk is a fair value risk.
The quantitative analysis of interest rate risk is included in Note 26.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing this risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group manages this risk through the use of regularly updated cash flow and covenant compliance forecasts and a liquidity headroom analysis which is used to determine funding requirements.
Adequate committed lines of funding are maintained from high-quality investment grade lenders.
The facilities committed to the Group as at 31 December 2016 are set out in Note 16. Credit risk Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets such as cash balances, derivative financial instruments, and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are net of appropriate allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on whether receivables are past due based on contractual terms, payment history and other available evidence of collectability.
Trade receivables are subject to credit limits and control and approval procedures in the operating companies.
Due to its large geographical base and number of customers, the Group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit risk on its trade receivables.
The quantitative analysis of credit risk relating to receivables is included in Note 14.
148 148 Strategic Financial Report Governance Statements Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 25.
Financial risk management continued Credit risk associated with cash balances and derivative financial instruments is managed centrally by transacting with existing relationship banks with strong investment grade ratings.
Accordingly, the Groups associated credit risk is limited.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, as shown in Note 26.
Capital management The Board considers equity shareholders funds, together with committed debt facilities, as capital for the purposes of funding the Groups operations.
Total managed capital at 31 December is: 2016 2015 m m Equity shareholders funds page 102 1,067.4 966.0 Committed debt facilities 628.1 526.2 1,695.5 1,492.2 Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the future development of the business.
The Board of Directors monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company.
This is carried out through a SAYE option scheme in the UK, as well as performance and restricted share plans.
Full details of these schemes are given in Note 23.
The main financial covenants in the Companys debt facilities are the ratio of net debt to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and the ratio of finance charges to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, amortisation and impairment.
Covenant testing is completed twice a year based on the half-year and year-end Financial Statements.
At 31 December 2016, the Company had, and is expected to continue to have, significant headroom under these financial covenant ratios.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares in the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

Deferred and contingent consideration relates to financial 2016: 10.4m, 2015: 7.0m and non-financial 2016: 5.8m, 2015: nil milestones on current and prior year acquisitions, as disclosed in Note 24.
The financial milestones are mainly sensitive to risk-adjusted discount rates and annual future revenue targets.
There were no movements between different levels of the fair value hierarchy in the year.
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
150 150 Strategic Financial Report Governance Statements Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 26.
Financial instruments continued The fair value of floating rate borrowings approximates to the carrying amount because interest rates are at floating rates where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using appropriate yield curves, to the net present value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on readily available market data.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding as at 31 December 2016 is a net liability of 4.2m 2015: 0.4m, of which 3.4m has been debited to the hedging reserve 2015: 0.2m and 0.8m debited to the Consolidated Income Statement 2015: 0.2m.
These contracts mature over periods typically not exceeding 18 months.
A summary of the movements in the hedging reserve during the year is presented below.
In accordance with IFRS, all of the cash flow hedges in 2016 and 2015 were deemed to be effective.
The fair value of deferred and contingent consideration is determined by considering the performance expectations of the acquired entity or the likelihood of non-financial integration milestones whilst applying the entity-specific discount rates.
The unobservable inputs are the projected forecast measures that are assessed on an annual basis.
Changes in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration relating to updated projected forecast performance measures are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period that the change occurs.
