FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT A FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: liquidity risk, market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk and credit risk.
The Groups treasury function seeks to ensure that sufficient funding is available to meet foreseeable needs, maintains reasonable headroom for contingencies and manages inflation and interest rate risk.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group relate to liquidity, interest rate and credit counterparty risk.
These risks and treasury operations are managed by the Chief Financial Officer in accordance with policies established by the Board.
Major transactions are individually approved by the Board.
Treasury activities are reported to the Board and are subject to review by internal audit.
Financial instruments are used to raise finance, manage risk, optimise the use of surplus funds and manage overall interest rate performance.
The Group does not engage in speculative activity.
i Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities which are designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and planned expansions equivalent to at least one years forecast requirements at all times.
Details of undrawn committed facilities and short-term facilities are provided in note 28.
Refinancing risk is managed under a Group policy that permits no more than 20% of Group net borrowings to mature in any financial year.
The Group and Water Business have entered into covenants with lenders.
While terms vary, these typically provide for limits on gearing primarily based on the Water Businesss Regulatory Capital Value and Viridor Limiteds EBITDA and interest cover.

124 PENNON GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2016 OVERVIEW GROUP PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ii Market risk The Group has a policy of maintaining at least 50% of interest-bearing liabilities at fixed rates.
The Group uses a combination of fixed rate and index-linked borrowings and fixed rate interest swaps as cash flow hedges of future variable interest payments to achieve this policy.
At the year-end 67% 2015 72% of Group net borrowings were at fixed rates including at least 50% of South West Waters borrowings fixed for the period to March 2016 after the impact of financial derivatives.
The notional principal amounts of the interest rate swaps are used to determine settlement under those swaps and are not therefore an exposure for the Group.
These instruments are analysed in note 23.
The interest rate for index-linked debt is based upon an RPI measure, which is also used in determining the amount of income from customers in South West Water and Bournemouth Water.
18% 2015 13% of the Groups gross debt is RPI index-linked.
The Group has no significant interest-bearing assets upon which the net return fluctuates from market risk.
Deposit interest receivable is expected to fluctuate in line with interest payable on floating rate borrowings.
Consequently the Groups income and cash generated from operations note 38 are independent of changes in market interest rates.
For 2016 if interest rates on variable net borrowings had been on average 0.5% higher lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year and equity would have increased decreased by 0.1 million 2015 0.4 million, for the equity sensitivity fair value, derivative impacts are excluded.
For 2016 if RPI on index-linked borrowings had been on average 0.5% higher lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year and equity would have decreased increased by 1.9 million 2015 1.5 million.
Foreign currency risk occurs at transactional and translation level from borrowings and transactions in foreign currencies.
These risks are managed through forward contracts, which provide certainty over foreign currency risk.
iii Credit risk Credit counterparty risk arises from cash and cash deposits, derivative financial instruments and exposure to customers, including outstanding receivables.
Further information on the credit risk relating to trade receivables is given in note 22.
Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Board has agreed a policy for managing such risk which is controlled through credit limits, counterparty approvals, and rigorous monitoring procedures.
The Group has no other significant concentration of credit risk.
The Groups surplus funds are managed by the Groups treasury function and are usually placed in short-term fixed interest deposits or the overnight money markets.
Deposit counterparties must meet a board approved minimum criteria based on their short term credit ratings.
B CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to minimise the cost of capital.
The Groups policy is to have a minimum of 12 months pre-funding of projected capital expenditure.
At 31 March 2016 the Group had cash and facilities, excluding restricted funds, of over 1.7 billion, meeting this objective.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group seeks to maintain a balance of returns to shareholders through dividends and an appropriate capital structure of debt and equity for each business segment and the Group.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net borrowings divided by total capital.
Net borrowings are analysed in note 39 and calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash deposits.
Total capital is calculated as total shareholders equity plus net borrowings.
The gearing ratios at the balance sheet date were: 2016 2015 m m Net borrowings note 39 2,484.4 2,197.1 Total equity 1,487.6 1,354.1 Total capital 3,972.0 3,551.2 Gearing ratio 62.5% 61.9% South West Water and Bournemouth Water is also monitored on the basis of the ratio of its net borrowings to Regulatory Capital Value.
Ofwats optimum gearing for the K6 2015-2020 regulatory period is set at 62.5%.
Bournemouth South West Water Water 2016 2015 2016 m m m Regulatory Capital Value 2,997.3 2,928.0 152.9 Net borrowings 1,817.5 1,793.3 86.7 Net borrowings Regulatory Capital Value 59.8% 62.1% 56.7% The Group has entered into covenants with lenders and, while terms vary, these typically provide for limits on gearing and interest cover.
The Group has been in compliance with its covenants during the year.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED C DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
The Groups financial instruments are valued principally using level 2 measures as analysed in note 23.
The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market for example over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
A variety of methods and assumptions are used based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt.
Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The carrying values, less impairment provision, of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities, principally environmental provisions, is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
