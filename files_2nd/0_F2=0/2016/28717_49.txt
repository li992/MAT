Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 123 Notes to the Company financial statements C. 25.
Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements of the Company.
Basis of preparation The financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS101.
The Companys shareholders were notified of, and did not object to, the use of the EU-adopted IFRS disclosure exemptions.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRS, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
In the transition to FRS 101, the Company has applied IFRS 1 whilst ensuring that its assets and liabilities are measured in compliance with FRS 101.
An explanation of how the transition to FRS 101 has affected the reported financial position and financial performance of the Company is provided in note C. 40.
The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: A cash flow statement and related notes.
Comparative period reconciliations for share capital, tangible fixed assets and intangible fixed assets.
Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Disclosures in respect of capital management.
The effects of new but not yet effective IFRS.
An additional balance sheet for the beginning of the earliest comparative period, following the reclassification of items in the financial statements see note C. 40.
Disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel.
As the consolidated financial statements of Renishaw plc include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair value measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial instruments disclosures.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Investments Investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for permanent impairment losses.
Property, plant and equipment, and depreciation Property, plant and equipment assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of assets less their estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Plant and equipment 3 to 25 years Motor vehicles 3 to 4 years No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and labour plus overheads applicable to the stage ofmanufacture reached.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Company intends and has the technical ability andsufficient resources to complete development, future economic benefits are probable and the Company can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2016 124 Financial statements Notes to the Company financial statements continued C. 25.
Accounting policies continued Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the Companys profit for the year.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Employee benefits The Company operated a contributory pension scheme, of the defined benefit type up to 5th April 2007, after which this scheme was closed for future accruals to existing members and was closed to new members.
Since 5th April 2007, the Company has operated a defined contribution scheme.
The scheme is administered by trustees who are independent of the Company finances.
Pension scheme assets in the defined benefit scheme are measured using market value.
Pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the interest on the schemes liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in other finance income.
The pension schemes surplus, to the extent that it is considered recoverable, or deficit is recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet, along with the related deferred tax.
Accruals are made for holiday pay, based on a calculation of the number of days holiday earned during the year, but not yet taken and also for the annual performance bonus.
Warranty on the sale of products The Company provides a warranty from the date of purchase, except for those products that we install where the warranty starts from the date of completion of the installation.
This is typically for a 12-month period, although up to three years is given for a small number of products.
A warranty provision is included in the accounts, which is calculated on the basis of historical returns and internal quality reports.
Derivative financial instruments In accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
The Company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from operational and financing activities.
Forward exchange contracts are recognised initially at cost and then subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Where a forward contract is designated as a hedge of the variability in future cash inflows, the effective part of any gain or loss on the forward contract is recognised directly in equity.
Anyeffective cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
Theineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreignexchange differences arising on such translation are recognised in the income statement.
Going concern The Companys business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic report, where also given are details of the financial and liquidity positions.
In addition, note 20 in the financial statements includes the Companysobjectives and policies for managing its capital, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk andliquidity risk.
The Company has considerable financial resources at its disposal and the directors have considered the current financial projections.
Asaconsequence, the directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue inoperational existence for the next 12 months.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual report andaccounts.

The cost of the Companys investment in that subsidiary undertaking reflected the underlying fair value of its net assets and goodwill at the time of acquisition.
Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2016 126 Financial statements Notes to the Company financial statements continued C. 27.
Intangible assets continued As a result of this transfer, the value of the Companys investment in that subsidiary undertaking fell below the amount at which it was stated in the Companys accounting records.
Schedule 1 to the Companies Act 2006 The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 SI 2008 No.
410 requires that the investment be written down accordingly and that the amount be charged as a loss in the Companys profit and loss account.
However, the directors considered that, as there was no overall loss to the Company, it failed to give a true and fair view to charge that diminution to the Companys profit and loss account for the year and was instead re-allocated to goodwill and the identifiable net assets transferred.
The resultant goodwill recorded in the Company balance sheet was 9,305,000.
