The analysis of provisions between current and non-current is: 2016 2015 m m Current 32.9 50.4 Non-current 171.0 194.4 221.4 227.3 Environmental and landfill restoration provisions are incurred during the operational life of each landfill site and for a considerable period thereafter.
The period of aftercare post-closure and the level of costs expected are uncertain and can vary significantly from site to site.
Key factors are the type of waste, the speed at which it decomposes, the volume of leachate requiring treatment and regulatory requirements specific to the site.
Environmental and landfill restoration provisions are expected to be substantially utilised throughout the operational life of a site and for landfill sites within 60 years of closure.
The provisions have been established assuming current waste management technology based upon estimated costs at future prices which have been discounted to present value.
During the year a landfill asset was disposed which resulted in the release of a 8.8 million environmental and landfill restoration provision.
The release of the provision has also been recognised within profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment.
The restructuring provision relates principally to severance costs and will be utilised within one year.
Other provisions include underperforming contracts of 15.6 million 2015 18.3 million, which are provided for at the net present value of the operating losses of the underperforming contracts and are to be utilised over the remaining period of the contract to which they relate.
