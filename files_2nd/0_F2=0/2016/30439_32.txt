Use of estimates & judgements The Companys significant accounting policies are set out below.
The preparation of the Company financial statements, in conformity with FRS 101, requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense.
Management base these judgements, estimates and assumptions on a combination of past experience, professional expert advice and other evidence that is relevant to each individual circumstance.
Actual results may differ from these estimates, judgements and assumptions, which are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The areas where management consider the more complex estimates, judgements and assumptions are required are those in respect of provisions note 12, retirement benefits note 8 and deferred taxation note 6.
Foreign currency translation The presentational and functional currency of the Company is Sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the Companys functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences are recognised in the income statement.
Property, plant & equipment The value of property, plant & equipment is presented at historical cost.
Depreciation of property, plant & equipment, other than assets under construction, is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost less residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, to the income statement over the expected useful life of the asset concerned, and is in the following ranges: Long leasehold land & buildings 20 years Office & computer equipment 3 10 years Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment losses.
The expected useful lives of acquired intangible assets are as follows: Purchased software 4 8 years Investments Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 184 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Financial Statements Post-employment benefits Post-employment benefits comprise pension benefits provided to certain current and former employees in the UK.
For defined benefit pension plans, the annual service cost is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is recognised over the future service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Current service cost and administration expenses are recognised in operating costs and net interest on net pension liability is recognised in finance costs.
The finance cost recognised in the income statement in the period reflects the net interest on the net pension liability.
This represents the change in the net pension liability resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening net liability, taking into account employer contributions paid into the plan, and hence reducing the net liability, during the period.
Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between interest on the plan assets, experience on the benefit obligation and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation, using a discount rate based on yields at the balance sheet date on appropriate high quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Companys obligations and are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date.
The balance sheet amount recognised is limited to the present value of economic benefits which the Company expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is also given to any minimum funding requirements.
For defined contribution plans, the cost represents the Companys contributions to the plans and these are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
Share-based payments Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and as a consequence of occasional one-off conditional awards made to employees.
The last equity settled grant under the Executive Bonus Scheme EBS was during 2013, with no award being made in the current year.
The fair value of the LTIP at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straightline basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service or performance conditions.
The previously granted equity settled incentives under the Executive Bonus Scheme EBS were determined as a percentage of the annual bonus and were matched by the Company with a share award that would vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, provided the individual continued to hold the original bonus shares awarded and continued to be employed by the Company at the date of vesting.
In addition the EBS included a strategic bonus shares element for a limited number of senior employees.
The fair value of the matching and strategic elements of the EBS was determined at the date of grant of the bonus and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Company recognises a compensation cost in respect of this plan that is based on the fair value of the awards granted.
The fair value was determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
Financial assets & liabilities The Companys principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans and fixed rate notes, commercial paper, cash and short-term deposits.
The Company also has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a fide-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.
The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets or liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves, spot foreign exchange rates and counterparty and own credit risk.
Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the income statement.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 185 Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Treasury shares The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the total comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Taxation Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the period.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base with the following exceptions: i Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and ii A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unutilised tax losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised directly in equity.
Loss profit attributable to the Company The loss dealt with in the accounts of the Company was 13.5m 2015: profit of 100.5m.

Participation in the Scheme resulted in shares with a value of 29.6m being issued and a cash dividend of 32.4m for the 2015 final settlement, and shares with a value of 19.1m being issued and a cash dividend of 13.4m for the 2016 interim settlement.
The proposed dividend is based on the number of shares in issue, excluding treasury shares held, at the date the financial statements were approved and authorised for issue.
The final dividend may differ due to increases or decreases in the number of shares in issue between the date of approval of this annual report and financial statements and the record date for the final dividend.

Retirement benefits The Company has two funded defined benefit plans the Main Plan and the Executive Plan and an unfunded retirement benefit plan for retired directors.
The Company also operates a defined contribution plan.
Contributions to the defined contribution arrangement are in addition to those set out below and are charged directly to the income statement.
For the defined benefit plans, benefits are related to service and final salary.
The Main Plan closed to future accrual of benefits effective from 30 June 2015.
The weighted average duration of the expected benefit payments from the Main Plan is around 17 years and from the Executive Plan it is around 14 years.
The current funding target for the UK plans is to maintain assets equal to the value of the accrued benefits.
The Main Plan holds insurance policies in respect of a significant proportion of deferred and retired pensioners.
The regulatory framework in the UK requires the Trustees and Company to agree upon the assumptions underlying the funding target, and then to agree upon the necessary contributions required to recover any deficit at the valuation date.
There is a risk to the Company that adverse experience could lead to a requirement for the Company to make considerable contributions to recover any deficit.
This risk is significantly reduced for the Main Plan through the insurance policies held by the Plan.
Assumptions The significant actuarial assumptions used for accounting purposes reflect prevailing market conditions and are as follows: 2016 2015 Significant actuarial assumptions: Discount rate % pa 2.6 3.7 Retail Prices inflation assumption % pa 3.3 3.0 Post-retirement mortality life expectancies in years : Current pensioners at 65 male 22.2 22.4 Current pensioners at 65 female 24.3 24.5 Future pensioners at 65 male 24.0 24.1 Future pensioners at 65 female 26.2 26.4 Other related actuarial assumptions: Rate of increases for pensions in payment % pa Pre 6 April 2006 service 3.1 2.9 Post 5 April 2006 service 2.1 2.0 Consumer Prices inflation assumption % pa 2.2 2.0 The assumptions used to determine end-of-year benefit obligations are also used to calculate the following periods cost.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity.
The current disclosures above relate to assumptions based on longevity in years following retirement at the balance sheet date, with future being that relating to a member retiring in 2036 in 20 years time.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 189 Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued 8.
Retirement benefits continued The assets and liabilities of the plans are as follows.
2016 2015 m m Plan assets at fair value Equities quoted 206.9 168.6 Diversified Growth Funds primarily quoted 51.5 46.4 Corporate bonds quoted 82.3 71.0 Government bonds quoted 97.2 81.2 Insurance policies unquoted 379.2 345.1 Cash quoted 1.6 2.8 Fair value of plan assets 818.7 715.1 Present value of funded obligations 938.4 781.8 Net funded obligations 119.7 66.7 Present value of unfunded obligations 1.6 1.4 Net liability 121.3 68.1 Plan in surplus 9.8 8.2 Plan in deficit 131.1 76.3 The government bonds held are primarily index-linked, with around only 7% of the total government bonds being fixed interest.
The pension plans have not directly invested in any of the Companys own financial instruments, or in properties or other assets used by the Company.
The investment strategy for the UK is to hold equities and other return seeking assets such as diversified growth funds and a mixture of bonds to meet the assessed value of the benefits promised for the non-insured deferred pensioners.
For the remaining deferred pensioners and the bulk of pensioners currently receiving their benefit, the liabilities are backed by insurance policies and suitable bonds.
The change in net liabilities recognised in the balance sheet is comprised as follows.
2016 2015 m m Opening net liabilities 68.1 80.1 Expense charged to profit and loss 2.6 4.3 Amount recognised in statement of comprehensive income 53.1 12.9 Employer contributions 2.5 3.4 Closing net liabilities 121.3 68.1 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 190 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Financial Statements The amounts recognised in the income statement and in the statement of comprehensive income for the period are analysed as follows.
2016 2015 m m Recognised in the Income Statement Current service cost 1.2 Administrative expenses 0.2 0.3 Included in operating loss 0.2 1.5 Interest on net pension liability 2.4 2.8 Total expense charged to profit & loss 2.6 4.3 Recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income Actual return on plan assets 133.7 23.2 Less: interest on plan assets 25.9 24.8 107.8 1.6 Other actuarial losses due to Changes in financial assumptions 171.6 24.3 Changes in demographic assumptions 10.7 2.1 Experience on benefit obligations 11.9 Actuarial losses gains recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income 53.1 12.9 Current service cost and administration expenses are recognised in operating costs and interest on net pension liability is recognised in other finance costs.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit method.
The Company made special contributions of 2.4m in 2016 2015: 2.4m in addition to the Companys regular contributions.
The most recent actuarial funding valuation of the Main Plan was as at 31 December 2014 when the funding shortfall was 65.0m.
Under the recovery plan agreed with the Trustees, the Company entered into a pension funding partnership structure under which it contributed interests in a Scottish Limited Partnership SLP for the Main Plan.
The Main Plans interests in the SLP will reduce the deficit on a funding basis, although the agreement will not affect the position directly on a FRS 101 accounting basis as the investments held do not qualify as assets for FRS 101 purposes.
As a partner in the SLP, the Main Plan is entitled to receive a share of the profits of the SLP once a year for 15 years.
The profits to be shared with the Plan will be reflected in the Companys financial statements as a pension contribution.
The Executive Plan actuarial valuation at 31 December 2013 included a funding shortfall of 10.6m with agreed recovery contributions of 2.4m per annum to 31 December 2017, subject to reassessment at future triennial valuations.
The Company has taken legal advice regarding its UK arrangements to confirm the accounting treatment under IFRIC 14 and the current exposure draft of the revised IFRIC 14 with regard to recognition of a current surplus and also recognition of a minimum funding requirement.
This confirmed that there is no requirement to adjust the balance sheet and that recognition of a current surplus is appropriate on the basis that the Company has an unconditional right to a refund of a current or projected future surplus at some point in the future.
For the same reason, there is no requirement for the Company to adjust the balance sheet to recognise the future agreed deficit recovery contributions.
Having considered the position, taking account of the legal input received and noting that the Trustees of the UK arrangements do not have discretionary powers to unilaterally wind up the schemes without cause, the Directors of the Company have concluded that the Company has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus.
Amendments to the current version of IFRIC 14 are currently being considered.
The total Company contributions for 2017 including those expected from the SLP are expected to be 4.5m.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 191 Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued 8.
Retirement benefits continued Sensitivity analysis Changes in key assumptions can have a significant effect on the reported net retirement benefit obligation and the income statement expense for 2017.
The effects of changes in those assumptions are set out in the table below.
Increase Decrease Increase Decrease 2016 2016 2015 2015 m m m m Discount rate Effect on defined benefit obligation of a 1.0% change 143.3 174.3 108.3 129.8 Effect on net liability of a 1.0% change 106.6 133.3 78.3 96.6 RPI inflation and associated assumptions Effect on defined benefit obligation of a 1.0% change 90.3 82.8 69.7 64.3 Effect on net liability of a 1.0% change 64.2 58.1 47.6 43.4 Life expectancy Effect on defined benefit obligation of a 1 year change 28.1 28.1 23.4 23.4 Effect on net liability of a 1 year change 14.1 14.1 10.7 10.7 The impact on the net liability is significantly reduced as a result of the insurance policies held.
In the absence of such policies, the impact on the net liability would be much closer to the significantly higher impact on the defined benefit obligation shown in the table.
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation and net liability in isolation and assume no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
In practice, for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the invested non-insurance policy assets held by the plans.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligations are analysed as follows.
