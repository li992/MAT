Examples include some types of depreciation and amortisation and the benefit of R&D tax incentives.
b R eflects the differences between initial accounting estimates and tax returns submitted to tax authorities, including the release and establishment of provisions for uncertain tax positions.
c R eflects losses made in countries where it has not been considered appropriate to recognise a deferred tax asset, as the potential for future taxable profits is not sufficiently certain and we have not agreed the value of tax losses with local authorities.
d Following the acquisition of EE, we have expanded the categories of factors affecting the total taxation expense.
Prior year amounts are presented on a consistent basis.

Balances at 1 April 2014 are presented on a consistent basis.
b Includes a deferred tax asset of 2m 2014 15: 2m arising on contributions payable to defined contribution pension plans.
The acquisition relates to deferred tax assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition of the EE, such as deferred tax liabilities on fair value adjustments note 13 and deferred tax assets acquired with the business of EE, such as tax losses.
We have recognised a deferred tax asset at 31 March 2016 of 293m in respect of EE Limiteds historic tax losses.
We expect to be able to utilise these against future taxable profits in EE Limited.
If EE Limiteds business were subject to a major change in the nature or conduct of trade on or before 5 February 2018, these losses would be forfeited and a current tax liability of 152m would be created.
Based on our current plans, we do not expect a major change to arise.
