Total revenue can be heavily distorted by year on year fluctuations in the market prices of precious metals.
In addition, in many cases, the value of precious metals is passed directly on to our customers.
2 Sales excluding precious metals have been adjusted to include certain non pass through precious metal items.
3 Before amortisation of acquired intangibles, major impairment and restructuring charges, profit or loss on disposal of businesses, significant tax rate changes and, where relevant, related tax effects.
4 Per 200,000 working hours in a rolling year.
5 Restated to include accidents that occurred during 2014 15 but that were not declared as having resulted in lost time.
6 Restated for incidents reclassified after the year end.
7 Restated due to initial diagnosis being changed.
8 Restated to account for a change in calorific value of gas purchased in South Africa.
9 Restated using national carbon intensity figure for Macedonia.
