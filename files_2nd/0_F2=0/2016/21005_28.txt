2 The 0.2 million issue of shares relates to shares issued under management incentive plans in the year ended 31 December 2015.
3 The restructure of the Group between 8 and 12 February 2016 resulted in the Company issuing 300,000,000 ordinary 0.10 shares to become the ultimate Parent of the Group, and to convert existing shareholder debt to equity.
This resulted in the recognition of 252.9 million in share premium, 8.8 million in the capital reserve and 157.9 million in a Group restructure reserve.
4 At IPO 100,000,000 additional ordinary 0.10 shares were allotted and issued at a price of 2.00 per share, representing a premium of 1.90 per share.
11.6 million of share issue costs were incurred.
The premium was recorded in the Companys share premium account.
5 On 8 March 2016, 542,500 ordinary 0.10 shares were issued to employees under the Share Incentive Plan SIP.
Refer to Note 10 for further details.
6 On 8 June 2016, the Company completed a reduction of its share capital, whereby its nominal share capital was reduced to approximately 4.0 million, the amount standing to the share premium account was cancelled, and 876,266,690 deferred shares of 0.01 each which were issued by way of a bonus issue on 7 June 2016 for the purpose of capitalising the Companys capital reserve were cancelled.
These steps resulted in distributable reserves of approximately 476.2 million.
