In September 2015 the Group extended its syndicated committed revolving credit facility of 1.35bn by a further year, effectively resetting its five year term and resulting in a maturity date of September 2020.
The Group also has a bilateral revolving credit facility of 150m due to mature in May 2016.
The revolving credit facility incurs commitment fees and drawdowns bear interest at a spread above LIBOR.
In the event of default of covenants on the bank facility, the principal amounts and any interest accrued are repayable on demand.
There were no drawings under these credit facilities at the balance sheet date and therefore the Group had 1,500m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities available 2015: 1,180m.
