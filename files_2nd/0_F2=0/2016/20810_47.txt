The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.

The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Amec Foster Wheeler believe some of these policies require a high level of judgement, and the most critical accounting policies and significant areas of judgement and estimation arise from: Impairment of investments in subsidiaries Determining whether the Companys investments in subsidiaries have been impaired requires estimations of the investments recoverable amount.
Where recoverable amount is based on value in use, these calculations require the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the investments and suitable discount rates in order to calculate present values.
The carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries at the balance sheet date was 3,359m 2015: 4,219m with an impairment loss of 539m recognised in 2016 2015: 351m.

Financial instruments Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value.
Subsequent valuation depends on the designation of the instrument and is as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currencies Transactions in a currency other than Sterling are translated to Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account in the year.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured in terms of historical cost and are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets held at 31 December 2016 are as follows: Software Three to seven years Interest Interest is recognised in profit or loss on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
Investments Investments are stated at cost less impairment losses.
Where equity-settled share-based payments are granted to the employees of subsidiary companies, the fair value of the award is treated as a capital contribution by the Company and the investments in subsidiaries are adjusted to reflect this capital contribution.
Pensions The Company participates in the Amec Foster Wheeler Pension Plan formerly the Amec Staff and Executive defined benefit pension schemes.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the Company.
As there is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost to individual Group entities, the Company has recognised a cost equal to the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
Details of the defined benefit schemes can be found in note 14 of the consolidated accounts.
Contributions to the defined contribution schemes are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they become payable.
Tangible assets Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life.
The estimated useful lives as at 31 December 2016 are as follows: Plant and equipment Three to five years Remuneration of auditors The detailed information concerning auditors remuneration is shown in note 4 of the consolidated accounts.
Share-based payments There are share-based payment arrangements which allow Amec Foster Wheeler employees to acquire Amec Foster Wheeler shares: these awards are granted by Amec Foster Wheeler.
The fair value of awards granted is recognised as a cost of employment with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the award.
The fair value of the award is measured using a valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted.
The amount recognised as a cost is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares that vest except where non-vesting is due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by IAS 12 Income Taxes.
