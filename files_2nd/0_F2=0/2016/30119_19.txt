Therefore, the determination of estimates requires employees under the terms of the Groups share incentive the exercise of judgement based on various assumptions and schemes or the Groups share save schemes or are sold, any other factors such as historical experience, current and expected consideration received is included in shareholders equity.
The Directors frequently re-evaluate these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and Dividends circumstances dictate.
The Directors believe that the following judgements are critical due to the degree of estimation required Dividends proposed by the Board of Directors and unpaid at and or the potential material impact they may have on the the period end are not recognised in the financial statements Groups financial position and performance.
until they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual GeneralMeeting.
Supplier income The overwhelming majority of supplier income, in excess of 85% by value, is determined by reference to fixed price discounts on actual purchases with approximately 4% being volume rebates that are subject to stepped rebate targets, the rebate percentage increasing as values or volumes purchased reach pre-agreed targets.
However, by the year-end the Group knows whether those targets were reached.
Approximately 80% of amounts receivable for supplier income are received during the year as they are earned and settled monthly, although some agreements may also stipulate quarterly, bi-annual or annual payments: with only two of the arrangements not being co-terminous with the Groups statutory year-end.
Therefore the key judgements relate to the total value of rebates and fixed price discounts still to be received at the year-end and the amount to be set against the gross value of inventory.
These are determined using established methodologies and in the case of collectability managements knowledge of the parties involved and historical collection trends.
Other supplier income relates to customer sales support received in respect of sales of specific products to specific customers which is included in the income statement when the relevant sale occurs, i. e. when all conditions for it to be earned have been met.

As explained in the Cash generating units section of this note setting out the judgements made in respect The Directors consider that individual assets do not generate of supplier income, the calculation of the value deferred into cash flows that are largely independent of those from other stock is complicated due to the number, nature and structure of assets and consequently that, for the purposes of impairment the agreements in place.

In addition the recent trend in sales.
Directors have made certain assumptions concerning discount rates and the future development of the business that are consistent with its corporate plan.
Whilst the Directors consider their assumptions to be realistic, should actual results, including those for market volume changes, be different from expectations, for instance due to a worsening of the UK economy, then it is possible that the value of goodwill and other intangible assets included in the balance sheet could become impaired.
The pre-tax discount rate is derived from the Groups weightedaverage cost of capital WACC calculated by the Groups advisors.
The WACC is based upon the risk free rate for twenty-year UK gilts, adjusted for the UK market risk premium, which reflects the increased risk of investing in UK equities and the relative volatilities of the equity of the Group compared to themarket as a whole.
In arriving at the discount rate the Directors have applied an adjustment to reflect their view of the relative risk of the Groups operations.
Further details concerning the judgements made by the Directors in respect of goodwill and other intangible assets and the impairment testing thereof, aregiven in note 13.

Against this background the prospects of each business in the Plumbing & Heating division have been reassessed and the Group has determined that it is appropriate to impair further the carrying value of assets in the division.
In addition the performance of the Groups small tile business is expected to fall below previous expectations.
Accordingly an impairment charge of 235.4m has been made in the income statement, an analysis of which is shown in note 13.
In October 2016, as a result of the economic uncertainty, the Group announced a number of branch and distribution centre closures together with other cost reduction measures.
In accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2 the total cost of 56.6m has been treated as exceptional.
The exceptional items consist of the following: 16.5m of property, redundancy and other costs, together with asset write downs associated with the closure of 51 branches and 10 distribution centres 29.6m of costs arising from the rationalisation of parts of the Groups supply chain which resulted in the closure of ten distribution centres.
The costs comprised onerous lease and dilapidation provisions, other property related costs, redundancy and reorganisation costs and asset write downs.

The Company As a result of the impairment recognised in the Group, the Company has impaired the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries at 31December 2016 by 19.0m.
6. BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHICAL SEGMENTS As required by IFRS 8 the operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to assess their performance.
All four divisions sell building materials to a wide range of customers, none of which are dominant, and operate almost exclusively in the United Kingdom and consequently no geographical information is presented.
The operating segments of the Group are aggregated into the four divisions, the reportable segments of the Group, based on shared economic characteristics and similarities in their customers and products.
Segment result represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of certain central costs, finance income and costs and income tax expense.
Unallocated segment assets and liabilities comprise financial instruments, current and deferred taxation, cash and borrowings and pension scheme assets and liabilities.
During 2016 an impairment loss was recognised in the Consumer and Plumbing & Heating segments in respect of goodwill and other assets totalling 235.4m.
In 2015 an impairment loss was recognised in the Plumbing & Heating segment in respect of goodwill and other intangible assets totalling 140.6m.
There were no other inter segment transfers in 2016 or 2015.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to calculate the fair value of the options and the amount to be expensed.
The probability of the performance conditions being achieved was included in the fair value calculations.
The inputs into the model for options granted in the year expressed as weighted averages are as follows: 2016 2015 Executive SAYE Nil price Executive SAYE Nil price options options options options Share price at grant date pence 1,785 1,569 1,797 1,948 2,022 1,964 Option exercise price pence 1,847 1,342 - 1,959 1,616 - Volatility % 23.4% 28.2% 23.7% 24.2% 23.4% 24.2% Option life years 3.0 3.4 2.9 3.0 3.3 2.9 Risk-free interest rate % 0.5% 0.1% 0.5% 0.7% 0.9% 0.7% Expected dividends 2.3% 2.6% 2.3% 2.2% 2.1% 2.2% as a dividend yield % Volatility is based on historic share prices over a period equal to the vesting period.
Option life used in the model has been based on options being exercised in accordance with historical patterns.
For executive share options the vesting period is 3 years.
If options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, these options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before options vest.
SAYE options vest after 3 or 5 years and expire 3 or 5 years after the date of grant.
The risk-free interest rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds on a term consistent with the vesting period.
Dividends used are based on actual dividends where data is known and future dividends estimated using a dividend cover of three times within the Boards target range.
The expected life of options used in the model has been adjusted, based upon managements best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
A description of the share schemes operated by the Group is contained in the remuneration report on pages 74 to 98.

Cash generating units The Directors consider that each branch or distribution network in the Group is an individual Cash Generating Unit CGU.

The goodwill of 9.4m associated with those branches has beenreallocated.
Measuring recoverable amounts The Group tests goodwill and other non-monetary assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that an impairment may have occurred.
The recoverable amounts of the goodwill and other non-monetary assets with indefinite useful lives are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and like-for-like market volume changes which impact sales and therefore cash flow projections and maintenance capital expenditure.
Management estimates pre-tax discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU groupings that are not reflected in the cash flow projections.
At the beginning and end of the financial year the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in all segments was in excess of their book value after the adjustment for impairment at 31 December 2016 outlined below.
In the absence of a binding agreement to sell the assets and active reference market on which fair value can be determined the recoverable amount of the goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives was determined according to value in use.
The Directors calculations have shown that no impairments have occurred other than detailed in the table opposite.
The key variables applied to the value in use calculations were: Cash flow forecasts, which were derived from the most recent board approved corporate plan updated for changes in current trading conditions The sales market volume assumptions underlying the cash flow forecasts are the Directors estimates of likely future changes based on historic performance excluding future investment and enhancements and the current outlook for both the UK economy and the UK building materials industry.
This is viewed as the key operating assumption because the state of the building materials market determines the Directors approach to margin and cost maintenance.
A risk adjusted pre-tax discount rate is calculated by reference to the weighted average cost of capital WACC of the Group.
For2016, the pre-tax discount rate ranged between 9.6% and 11.1% 2015: 9.0% to 9.8%, which is not significantly different for any individual CGU or CGU grouping.
That is because each CGU operates in the same market, selling the same product types therefore the risk profiles are not dissimilar.
142 Financial Statements Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial Statements For 2016, cash flows beyond the corporate plan 2020 and beyond have been determined using a growth rate of 2.1%, which is the average long-term forecast GDP growth outlined in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook report produced by the Office for Budget Responsibility.
TheDirectors believe this is the most appropriate indicator of long-term growth rates that is available 2015 growth rate:2.1%.
Impairment Following the annual impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets, the Group has recognised an impairment charge in respect of goodwill and other intangible assets of 231.3m 2015:140.6m and 4.1m 2015: nil in respect of tangible fixed assets.
Trading conditions in the Plumbing and Heating and Tile markets have been challenging and as a consequence expectations of future profitability were reduced in the value in use calculations.
The impairment charge is analysed as follows: Acquired Tangible Acquired customer fixed Goodwill brands relationships assets Total Cash generating unit m m m m m F & P - 9.9 3.5 0.1 13.5 PTS - 2.5 - 3.9 6.4 CPS 188.9 - - - 188.9 Solfex 4.0 0.9 - - 4.9 Tile Giant 18.8 - - - 18.8 Bathrooms.
com 2.1 0.7 - 0.1 2.9 213.8 14.0 3.5 4.1 235.4 Sensitivity of results to changes in assumptions Whilst management believe the assumptions are realistic, it is possible that a further impairment would be identified if any of the above key assumptions were changed significantly.
For instance factors which could cause an impairment are: Significant underperformance relative to the forecast results Changes to the way the assets are used or changes to the strategy for the business A deterioration in the UK economy The impairment review calculations are based upon anticipated discounted future cash flows.
For most of the CGU groupings, given the prudence already built into the Groups corporate plan and the level of headroom they show, the Directors do not envisage reasonably possible changes to the key operating assumptions that are sufficient to generate a different outcome to the impairment calculations undertaken.
However, for the CGU groupings listed in the table below this is not the case as the Directors consider that reasonably possible changes in key assumptions could result in discounted future cash flows being insufficient to allow full recovery of the carrying value of the CGUs goodwill and other intangible assets.
The Directors have conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the specific value for each assumption, all other assumptions remaining the same, that would result in the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets equalling their recoverable amounts and these are shown in the tables below and on page 144.
The sole market value adjustment is the average annual change incorporated in the corporate plan of each CGU grouping.

Accordingly for Toolstation, Plumbnation, Primaflow, Underfloor Heating and certain product related brands the Directors have decided it is appropriate to amortise their brand costs over their estimated useful lives.
The useful lives of those brands being amortised range from 10 to 20 years with the remaining lives ranging from 3 to 13 years.
The Directors consider that the other brands, which are also all leading brands in their sectors with significant histories and significant growth prospects, have an indefinite useful life.
They are reviewed annually for impairment: details of impairment testing and the impairments recognised in 2016 are shown in note 13.
Acquired customer relationships are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which range from 5 to 15 years.
The remaining lives of amortised customer relationships range from 1 to 9 years.
The Company has no intangible assets.
Assets under construction consist of software being developed for use by the Group, which is not yet ready to be used.

The Directors consider the only class of asset containing significant credit risk is trade receivables.
The average credit term taken for sales of goods is 57 days 2015: 55 days.
The allowance for doubtful debts is estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values.
The business has provided fully for all receivables outstanding for more than 90 days beyond agreed terms.
Trade receivables which have been outstanding for less than 90 days and that are not considered recoverable are specifically provided for.
No interest is charged on the trade receivable from the date of the invoice until the date the invoice is classified as overdue according to the trading terms agreed between the Group and the customer.
Thereafter, the Group retains the right to charge interest at between 2% to 4% per annum above the clearing bank base rate on the outstanding balance.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors unprovided against with a carrying amount of 44.3m 2015: 66.8m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not identified a significant change in credit quality and as such, the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable and therefore there is no allowance for doubtful debts.
Except for some instances of personal guarantees the Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

None of the Companys debts are overdue.
The Directors do not consider there to be any significant credit risk, as the majority of the debt is due from subsidiaries.

The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Group has considered the impact of credit risk on its financial instruments and because the counterparties are banks with strong credit ratings considers its impact to be immaterial.
c. Fair value of financial instruments The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs 156 Financial Statements Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Financial Statements There were no transfers between levels during the year.

Interest risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and forward interest rate contracts when appropriate.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is on either a fixed rate basis or is subject to movements within pre-defined limits.
To achieve its desired interest rate profile the Group uses interest rate swap contracts where necessary.
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
On 15 September 2014 the Group and Company entered into interest rate swap contracts with seven syndicate banks which swapped the fixed rate payable on the listed 250m sterling bond of 4.375% maturing in 2021, to floating rates based on 6 month libor.
On12October2016 these swap contracts were cancelled to mitigate the impact of expected increases in interest rates from historically low levels in the medium term.
At the point of cancellation the fair value of the interest rate derivatives was measured at 16.8m.
On cancellation of the swaps the bond was held on the balance sheet at its fair value of 266.8m, and the Group received 16.8m of cash.
During the remaining life of the bond the balance sheet carrying value will amortise from 266.7m to 250m with an annualised P&L credit of approximately 3.4m.
This will partially offset the increase in interest charges caused by moving the bond from floating interest rates to a higher fixed interest rate of 4.375%, giving an effective rate of 3.0%.
At 31 December 2016, 0.7m of the settlement benefit had been amortised, matched by a fair value reduction in the carrying value of the associated sterling bond which had reduced to 266.0m.

Cross currency swaps and currency forward contracts The $200m unsecured senior notes hedged using cross currency swaps were repaid in January 2016 and the three currency forward contracts with a notional value of $30m each and one with a notional value of $20m were duly settled.
The Group had no outstanding cross currency swaps at 31 December 2016.

The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts all of which are less than one year in duration to buy US dollars to hedge the exchange risk arising from these anticipated future purchases.
At the balance sheet date the total notional value of contracts to which the Group was committed was US$63.0m 2015: US$72.4m.
The fair value of these derivatives was 1.7m 2015: 1.3m.
These contracts are not designated cash flow hedges and accordingly the fair value movement has been reflected in the incomestatement.

The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash flows on the derivative instruments that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross cash flows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates as illustrated by the yield curves existing at the reportingdate.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued g. Interest rate sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1.0% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel.
At the 31 December 2016 the Group had no floating rate liabilities, after the repayment of the US private placement in January, thecancellation of the interest rate swaps on the 250m sterling bond and no drawdown on the revolving credit facility at 31December2016.
There was 184.5m on short term deposit at 31 December 2016.
A 1.0% increase decrease in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have the following impact on: Profit before taxation for the year ended 31 December 2016 would have increased decreased by 1.8m 2015: decreased increased by 4.1m due to the short term deposits: Net equity would have increased decreased by 1.5m 2015: decreased increased by 3.2m 24.

In 2016, as set out in note 5, the Group established additional exceptional provisions as a result of reorganising parts of its branch and distribution networks.
The Group recognised in 2014 an exceptional provision of 16.1m relating to the reconfiguration of the Plumbing & Heating division.
The provision covered expected property costs, legal costs and IT costs arising from the reconfiguration.
Should a provision ultimately prove to be unnecessary then it is credited back into the income statement.
Where the provision was originally established as an exceptional item, any release is shown as an exceptional credit.
It is Group policy to insure itself using policies with a high excess against claims arising in respect of damage to assets, or due to employers or public liability claims.
The nature of insurance claims means they may take some time to be settled.
The insurance claims provision represents managements best estimate, based upon external advice of the value of outstanding claims against it where the final settlement date is uncertain.

PENSION ARRANGEMENTS Defined benefit schemes The Group operates four final salary schemes being The Travis Perkins Pensions and Dependants Benefit Scheme the TP DB scheme and the immaterial Platinum pension scheme the TP Schemes and the BSS Schemes being the BSS Defined Benefit Scheme the BSS DB Scheme and the immaterial BSS Ireland Defined Benefit Scheme.
All defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.
The TP scheme is for the majority of members a 1 60th scheme.
The assets of the TP DB schemes are held separately from those of the Group under the control of the schemes trustees.
Employees are entitled to start drawing a pension, based on their membership of a scheme, on their normal retirement date.
If employees choose to retire early and draw their pension, then the amount they receive is scaled down accordingly.
The TP schemes are funded by contributions from Group companies and employees.
Contributions are paid to the Trustees on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary who carries out a valuation every three years.
A full actuarial valuation of the TP DB scheme was carried out on 30 September 2014.
The IAS 19 valuation has been based upon the results of the 30 September 2014 valuation, and then updated to 31 December 2016 by a qualified actuary.
The present values of the defined obligations, the related current service costs and the past service costs for the scheme were measured using the projected unit method.
The assets of the BSS schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the schemes trustees.
Themost recent actuarial valuations of the BSS schemes assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations were carried out at 30 September 2014.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit method with a control period equal to the future working lifetime of the active members.
In June 2010, an agreement was reached with the Trustees of the TP DB scheme to fund 34.7m of the deficit using a Group-controlled special purpose vehicle SPV.
The pension scheme is entitled to receive the income of the SPV for aperiod of up to 20 years, subject to funding levels.
This income is backed by the security of 16 Travis Perkins freehold properties.
AstheSPV is consolidated into the Travis Perkins plc group accounts, advantage has been taken of Regulation 7 of The Partnership Accounts Regulations 2008 and accounts for the SPV will neither be audited or filed.
The TP schemes and the BSS schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk.
A summary of the risks and the management of those risks is given below.
Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit liabilities of the schemes is calculated using a discount rate predetermined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields.
If the return on scheme assets is below this rate it may create a plan deficit.
Currently the schemes have investments in equity securities, debt instruments and real estate.
Due to the long term nature of the scheme liabilities the trustees of the pension funds previously considered it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the scheme assets should be invested in equities.
However, following a review of the investment strategy, a derisking exercise is currently being undertaken that will result in a higher proportion of the largest two pension schemes assets being invested in gilts and corporate bonds liability driven investments.
Interest risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the schemes liabilities, but the effect will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the schemes debt assets.
Longevity risk The present value of the liabilities of the schemes is calculated by reference to the best estimate of mortality of pension scheme members both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the schemes members will increase the schemes liabilities.
Salary risk The present value of the defined benefit schemes liabilities is calculated by reference to the future salaries of scheme members.
As such an increase in salaries of scheme members will increase the schemes liabilities.
