7 Financial risk and hedging 7.1 Accounting policies Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivatives are transacted to mitigate financial risks that arise as a result of the Groups operating activities and funding arrangements.
At the inception of a hedge, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
The Group assesses whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item at inception and it also assesses whether the hedge has been and will continue to be effective on an ongoing basis.
All derivatives are initially recognised at fair value and are also measured at fair value at each reporting date.
Derivatives with positive fair values are recognised as assets and those with negative fair values as liabilities.
They are also categorised as current or non-current according to the maturity of each derivative.
All gains or losses arising due to changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in profit or loss except when the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting.
Cash flow hedges The Group designates derivatives into a cash flow hedge where they have been transacted to hedge a highly probable forecast transaction or a particular risk associated with an asset or liability.
The effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivatives, that are designated into cash flow hedge relationships, are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Cumulative gains or losses on derivatives are reclassified from other comprehensive income into profit or loss in the period when the transaction occurs.
Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is immediately recognised in profit or loss.
Fair value hedge The Group designates derivatives into a fair value hedge relationship when they hedge the Groups exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or a firm commitment.
The change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk is recognised in profit or loss for the period as well as the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the derivative.
Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Financial statements 86 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 31 January 2016 7 Financial risk and hedging continued 7.2 Financial risk management The Group has a centralised treasury function which manages funding, liquidity and other financial risk in accordance with the Board approved treasury policy.
The objective of the policy and controls that are established are to mitigate the risk of an adverse impact on the performance of the Group as a result of its exposure to financial risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is the Groups policy not to engage in speculative trading of financial instruments.
The Board retains ultimate responsibility for treasury activity and is involved in key decision making.
A Treasury Committee is established to provide governance and oversight to treasury activity within delegated authority limits and formally reports to the Audit Committee.
Foreign currency risk The majority of purchases made by the Group are denominated in sterling, however some trade purchases are made in other currencies, primarily the euro and US dollar.
The Groups objective is to reduce short term profit volatility from exchange rate fluctuations.
It is Group policy that a minimum of 80% of committed and highly probable exposures within the next six months are hedged and at least 40% of exposures in the following six months.
At the balance sheet date, the Group had hedged 81% of its exposure within the next six months 2015: 84%.
Cross-currency interest rate swaps are used to mitigate the Groups currency exposure arising from payments of interest and principal in relation to foreign currency funding, including the US dollar private placement USPP loan notes and the euro denominated bond.
At the reporting date, the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change 10% in the US dollar and euro exchange rates would equate to a 5m post tax profit or loss exposure in relation to the euro and 4m in relation to the US dollar, for the unhedged forecast foreign currency exposures over the next 12 months.
A weakening of the pound sterling by 10% against the euro and US dollar exchange rates would impact on other comprehensive income by 16m.
Liquidity risk The Group policy is to maintain an appropriate maturity profile across its borrowings and a sufficient level of committed headroom to meet obligations.
The Group finances its operations using a diversified range of funding providers including banks and bondholders.
A central cash forecast is maintained by the treasury function who monitor the availability of liquidity to meet business requirements and any unexpected variances.
The treasury function seek to centralise surplus cash balances to minimise the level of gross debt.
Short term cash balances, together with undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its day to day liquidity risk.
Any short term surplus is invested in accordance with Treasury Policy.
The Treasury Committee compares the committed liquidity available to the Group against the forecast requirements including policy headroom.
This policy includes a planning assumption that supply chain finance facilities are not available.
Interest rate risk The Group seeks to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates by maintaining at least 60% of its total borrowings at fixed interest rates.
As at the balance sheet date 91% 2015: 79% of the Groups borrowings are at fixed rate.
Whilst still applying the policy described above, from time-to-time the Group enters into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to achieve the appropriate proportion of fixed versus floating rate borrowings.
Credit risk As a retailer, the majority of the Groups revenue is received in cash at the point of sale and therefore credit risk is not considered significant to the Group.
Some credit risk does arise from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banking groups and exposures from other sources of income such as commercial income and tenants of investment properties.
The Group has established appropriate credit verification procedures in respect of financial institutions.
Limits on the total exposure to any counterparty or Group of connected counterparties are established within Treasury Policy taking into account credit ratings.
Compliance with limits is regularly monitored.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Commodity price risk The Group manages the risks associated with the purchase of electricity, gas and diesel consumed by its activities excluding fuel purchased for resale to customers by entering into hedging contracts to fix prices for expected consumption.
The Group has adopted a capital at risk model for hedging its fuel and power consumption.
The Treasury Committee reviews the Groups exposure to commodity prices and ensures it remains within policy limits.
A change of 10 % in the market value of the commodity price at the balance sheet date would affect other comprehensive income by 8m 2015: 9m.

Cash flow hedges At 31 January 2016 and 1 February 2015, the Group held US dollar and euro cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding cross-currency swaps at 31 January 2016 was $250m 2015: $250m and 700m 2015: 700m.
The energy price contracts and foreign currency derivatives shown in note 7.3 are designated as cash flow hedges.
Fair value hedges The valuation of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps designated in fair value hedges are 21m 2015: 31m.
Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Financial statements 88 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 31 January 2016 8 Pensions 8.1 Accounting policies A defined contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and provides no guarantee as to the quantum of retirement benefits that those contributions will ultimately purchase.
A defined benefit scheme is a pension scheme that is not a defined contribution scheme.
Defined benefit schemes Pension scheme assets are valued at market rates.
Pension scheme obligations are an estimate of the amount required to pay the benefits that employees have earned in exchange for current and past service, assessed and discounted to present value using the assumptions shown in note 8.4.
The net pension asset recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet is the net of the schemes assets and obligations, which are calculated separately for each scheme.
Current service cost is treated as an operating cost in the Consolidated statement of income and Statement of cash flows and is part of underlying earnings.
Net interest income expense is calculated by applying the discount rate on liabilities to the net pension liability or asset adjusted for cash flows over the accounting period and is recognised in finance income costs and excluded from underlying earnings.
Expenses incurred in respect of the management of scheme assets are included in Other comprehensive income as a reduction in the return on scheme assets.
Other scheme expenses are recognised in profit or loss as an operating expense.
Remeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses on the obligations and the return on scheme assets excluding interest.
They are recognised immediately in Other comprehensive income.
Amounts shown within note 8 are before any adjustments for deferred taxation.
8.2 Defined benefit schemes: summary and description The Group operates a number of defined benefit retirement schemes together the Schemes providing benefits based on a benefit formula that depends on factors including the employees age and number of years of service.
The Morrison and Safeway Schemes provide pension benefits based on either the employees compensation package or career average revalued earnings CARE the CARE Schemes.
The CARE Schemes are not open to new members and were closed to future accrual in July 2015.
The RSP is a cash balance scheme, which provides a lump sum benefit based upon a defined proportion of an employees annual earnings, which is revalued each year in line with inflation.
The position of each scheme at 31 January 2016 is as follows: 2016 2015 m m CARE Schemes 178 43 RSP 8 4 Net pension asset liability 186 39 At the year end, schemes in surplus have been disclosed within assets on the balance sheet.
The Group has taken legal advice with regard to the recognition of a pension surplus and also recognition of a minimum funding requirement under IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirement and their interaction.
This advice concluded that recognition of a surplus is appropriate on the basis that the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of a surplus.
Amendments to the current version of IFRIC 14 are currently being considered.
The legal advice received by the Group has concluded that the above accounting treatment should not be affected by the current exposure draft of the revised wording to IFRIC 14.

The Board of each Scheme is required by law to act in the best interest of the Scheme participants and is responsible for setting the investment, funding and governance policies of the fund.
A representative of the Group attends Trustee Investment Committee meetings in order to provide the Groups view on investment strategy, but the ultimate power lies with the Trustees.
The Deed and Rules of the Morrison Scheme gives the Trustees the power to set contributions.
In the Safeway Schemes and the RSP this power is given to the Group, subject to regulatory override.
The latest full actuarial valuations have been carried out as at 1 April 2013 for the Safeway Schemes and 5 April 2013 for the Morrison Scheme and the RSP.
The results of these valuations for the CARE Schemes have been used and updated for IAS 19 Employee benefits purposes for the period to 31 January 2016 by a qualified independent actuary.
For the RSP, an actuarial valuation for the purposes of IAS 19, based on member data as at 31 January 2016, has been completed by an independent actuary.
The Schemes expose the Group to inflation risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.
In addition, the CARE Schemes expose the Group to longevity risk.
8.3 Scheme assets Assets of the Schemes generate returns and ultimately cash that is used to satisfy the Schemes obligations.
They are not necessarily intended to be realised in the short term.
The Trustees of each Scheme invest in different categories of asset and in different allocations amongst those assets, according to the investment principles of that Scheme.
Currently, the investment strategy of the CARE Schemes is to maintain a balance of approximately 40% growth assets comprising equities and diversified growth funds and 60% bond-like-assets comprising liability driven investments, corporate bonds and multi asset credit investments.
RSP investments are currently based primarily in equities, however approximately 25% are in bond-like-assets.
There are no direct investments in the parent Companys own shares or property occupied by any member of the Group.

This is achieved through the use of liability driven investments LDI, whose main goal is to have sufficient assets to meet all current and future liabilities as they fall due.
LDI involves the use of derivatives such as swaps and other investment instruments.
There are no annuities or longevity swaps.
The movement in the fair value of the Schemes assets over the period was as follows: 2016 2016 2015 2015 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Fair value of scheme assets at start of period 4,050 87 3,058 39 Interest income 123 3 137 3 Return on scheme assets excluding interest 299 5 879 9 Employer contributions 27 49 46 39 Employee contributions 1 6 1 2 Benefits paid 87 1 68 4 Administrative expenses 3 1 3 1 Fair value of scheme assets at end of period 3,812 138 4,050 87 The Group previously entered into an agreement under which it contributed interests in a Scottish Limited Partnership SLP valued at 90m as at 30 January 2013 to the CARE Schemes.
During the year the Group agreed to provide an additional asset contribution of 150m.
The CARE Schemes interests in the SLP reduce the respective deficits on a funding basis, although the agreements do not affect the position directly on an IAS 19 accounting basis because the investments held by the CARE Schemes do not qualify as assets for IAS 19 purposes.
The additional 150m assets to be contributed to the SLP do not affect the funding or accounting position.
As partners in the SLP, the CARE Schemes are entitled to receive a share of the profits of the SLP twice a year for 20 years.
The profits shared with the Schemes are reflected in the Group financial statements as pension contributions.
The SLP made a cash contribution of 6.6m during the year ending 31 January 2016, and may make annual contributions of 6.6m for a further 17 years, dependent on funding levels in the schemes.
8.4 Present value of obligations The movement in the defined benefit obligation over the period was as follows: 2016 2016 2015 2015 CARE RSP CARE RSP m m m m Defined benefit obligation at start of period 4,093 83 3,071 37 Current service cost 24 62 43 37 Interest expense 123 3 137 2 Actuarial loss demographic assumptions 21 Actuarial gain loss financial assumptions 517 18 889 16 Actuarial gain experience 5 7 Curtailment gain 3 1 Employee contributions 1 6 1 2 Benefits paid 87 1 68 4 Defined benefit obligation at end of period 3,634 130 4,093 83 The durations of the defined benefit obligations at the end of the 2016 reporting period are: RSP 20 years: Morrisons CARE 25 years: Safeway CARE 23 years.

The mortality tables used at both year ends 2015 and 2016 are the S1PMA S1PFA-Heavy tables males females based on year of birth.
Following analysis completed as part of the 2013 actuarial valuations a scaling factor of 110% was applied to the mortality tables used in the Morrison Scheme.
Amongst the UK population, there is a continuing trend for a generation to live longer than the preceding generation.
For the 2015 and 2016 year ends, and in line with the 2013 actuarial valuations the mortality projections used the CMI 2012 rates with an annual rate of improvement of 1.5% p. a.

2 Sensitivity analysis on significant actuarial assumptions The following table summarises the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period if each of the significant actuarial assumptions listed above were changed, in isolation, assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
In practice, any movement in assumptions could be accompanied by a partially offsetting change in asset values, and the corresponding overall impact on the net asset is therefore likely to be lower than the amounts below in a number of scenarios.
Extrapolation of the sensitivities shown may not be appropriate.

The Morrison Scheme is entirely funded by the parent Company and the Safeway Scheme is funded by Safeway Limited and its subsidiaries.
The Groups subsidiaries participate in the RSP.
There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost between the parent Company and its subsidiaries.
The contribution of each participating subsidiary to the RSP is calculated in proportion to the number of employees that are members of the RSP.
The current best estimate of Group contributions to be paid for the accounting period commencing 31 January 2016 is 67m.
This estimate includes amounts payable from the SLP and salary sacrificed contributions from employees.
8.6 Closure of CARE Schemes to future accrual In July 2015, the Group reached an agreement with the trustees of the CARE Schemes to close the Schemes to future accrual.
The financial effect of this is to reduce the Groups exposure to future volatility, increases in pension liabilities and cost.
Subsequently, the Group has entered into an agreement to contribute additional assets into the SLP.
For further details of this agreement see note 8.3.
8.7 Defined contribution scheme set up costs As previously announced the Group intends to open a new defined contribution pension scheme for colleagues.
This scheme will become the Auto Enrolment scheme and as such the Group will be liable for backdated contributions for eligible colleagues to 1 October 2012.
The estimated set up costs relating to backdated contributions for the period 1 October 2012 to 31 January 2016 is 35m.
9 Share-based payments 9.1 Accounting policy Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees in exchange for services rendered by them.
The fair value of the share-based award is calculated at the date of grant and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
This is based on the Groups estimate of share options that will eventually vest.
This takes into account movement of non-market conditions, being service conditions and financial performance, if relevant.
The fair value of share options is measured by use of a binomial stochastic model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The charge in the period for share-based payments was 11m 2015: 11m.
9.2 Share save schemes The Share save scheme began in May 2000 and all employees including Executive Directors are eligible once the necessary service requirements have been met.
The scheme allows participants to save up to a maximum of 350 each month for a fixed period of three years.
Options are offered at a discount to the mid-market closing price on the day prior to the offer and are exercisable for a period of six months commencing after the end of the fixed period of the contract.
The exercise of options under this scheme is subject only to service conditions.
The schemes that launched in May 2011 and subsequently are under the new scheme rules approved by the shareholders in June 2010.
Annual report and financial statements 2015 16 93 9 Share-based payments continued 9.2 Share save schemes continued The fair value of options granted, and the inputs used to determine it are as follows: Grant date 19 May 2015 20 May 2014 13 May 2013 14 May 2012 Share price at grant date 1.81 2.10 2.83 2.79 Fair value of options granted 4.8m 11.6m 8.1m 9.1m Exercise price 1.64 1.64 2.25 2.36 Dividend yield 5.15% 6.21% 4.17% 3.69% Annual risk free interest rate 1.06% 1.00% 0.45% 0.53% 1 Expected volatility 22.7% 18.3% 16.8% 19.4% 1 The volatility measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis on weekly share prices over the past 3.37 years prior to the date of grant.
The requirement that the employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the Share save plan is a non-vesting condition.
This feature has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the binomial stochastic option pricing model.
The discount is determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based on expected future trends in the share price and employee behaviour.

The awards have no exercise price and accrue the value of dividends over the vesting period.
LTIP grants issued before 2013 are subject to the performance conditions, as stated below.
Since 2013, the performance conditions apply to Executive Committee members only.
Senior employees eligible for LTIPs have to satisfy a service condition only.
Given the size of the Executive Committee, the fair value of the LTIP grants assumes no leavers.
The leavers assumptions below relate to the senior employees only.
Awards normally vest three years after the original grant date, provided the relevant performance criteria have been met.
