2 Governance at BHP Billitoncontinued 2.11 Board meetings and attendance The Board meets as often as necessary to fulfil its role.
Directors are required to allocate sufficient time to the Company to perform their responsibilities effectively, including adequate time to prepare for Board meetings.
During the reporting year, the Board met 14 times, with 11 of those meetings held in Australia, two in the United Kingdom and one in the United States.
Regularly scheduled Board meetings generally run over two days including committee meetings and Director training and development sessions.
Members of the ELT and other members of senior management attended meetings of the Board by invitation.
Senior managers delivered presentations on the status and performance of our assets and matters reserved for the Board, including the approval of budgets, annual Financial Statements and strategy.

2.12 Director re-election The Board adopted a policy in 2011, consistent with the UK Corporate Governance Code, under which all Directors must seek re-election by shareholders annually if they wish to remain on the Board.
The Board believes annual re-election promotes and supports accountability to shareholders.
The combined voting outcome of the BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton Limited 2015 AGMs was that each Director received more than 98.9 per cent in support of their re-election.
Board support for re-election is not automatic.
Directors who are seeking re-election are subject to a performance appraisal overseen by the Nomination and Governance Committee.
Annual re-election effectively means all Directors are subject to a performance appraisal annually.
The Board, on the recommendation of the Nomination and Governance Committee, makes a determination as to whether it will endorse a retiring Director for re-election.
The Board will not endorse a Director for re-election if his or her performance is not considered satisfactory.
The Notice of Meeting will provide information that is material to a shareholders decision whether or not to re-elect a Director, including whether or not re-election is supported by the Board.
BHP Billiton does not apply or implement a no vacancy rule in relation to Board appointments.
Accordingly, Director candidates can be elected to the Board by ordinary resolution and are not required to out-poll an incumbent Director in order to be elected.
