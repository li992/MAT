Fidessa group plc 76 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 13 Intangible assets 2016 2015 Carrying value at 31st December 000 000 Goodwill 44,897 44,897 Acquired intangible assets 243 973 Product development 48,105 45,158 Software purchased for internal use 220 255 93,465 91,283 Goodwill Total 000 Carrying value at 1st January 2015, 1st January 2016 and 31st December 2016 44,897 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash generating units which can be no larger than an operating segment.
Annual impairment tests are conducted on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the estimated recoverable amount of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
Value in use calculations are used to estimate the recoverable amount of cash generating units.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the discount rate applied, future growth rate of the revenue and the operating margin.
These take into account the existing customer base and expected revenue commitments from it, anticipated additional sales to existing and new customers, planned expansion of the product and service offerings to the marketplace and the specific market trends that are currently seen and those expected in the future.
The whole of the goodwill carrying value is allocated to the Buy-side business unit and arose from the acquisition of LatentZero in 2007.
It resulted from the value of the assembled workforce, the synergistic nature of the acquisition due to the long-term cross-selling opportunities between the buy-side and sell-side clients, potential cost savings, the expected future growth and the acceleration of operations into the buy-side.
A cash flow forecast is prepared for the following year which is extended to subsequent years based on the estimated growth rate which reflects a reasonable future rate for the business after considering recent trading experience, the benefits of the recurring revenue model, assessing the market opportunities and threats and the potential expansion of the addressable market.
The cash flow forecast is discounted by the discount rate which is arrived at after estimating the general risk premium and the specific risk premium for the cash generating unit, current gilt rates and the businesss beta factor.
The value in use calculation used the anticipated results from the detailed forecast for the first year followed by 4% 2015: 5% per annum growth for the next ten years and concluded with a terminal growth rate of 2% 2015: 2%.
The expected useful life is materially greater than ten years and the growth rates applied are considered to reflect a likely average long-term growth rate for the products and services in the addressable market.
A discount rate of 9.5% pre-tax 2015: 8.0% was applied to the cash flow forecast.
The discount rate included increased estimates of the general and specific risk premiums, an increase in the beta factor and a fall in gilt rates.
The value in use calculation resulted in an estimated recoverable amount that was 40% 2015: 30% greater than the carrying value and exceeded it by 21.6 million 2015: 17.0 million.
Revised calculations of the estimated recoverable amount were undertaken to consider sensitivities for lower growth rates and lower operating margin.
The lower growth rate sensitivity calculation showed that with the growth rate for the whole period set to lower than the terminal rate the value in use remained greater than the carrying value.
The results of these sensitivity calculations supported the conclusion that the goodwill had not been impaired.
