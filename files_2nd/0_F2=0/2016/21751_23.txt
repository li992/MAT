Notes to the financial statements The notes have been grouped into sections under five key categories: 1.
Land bank and other operating assets and liabilities 4. Financing 5.
Other disclosures The key accounting policies have been incorporated throughout the notes to the financial statements adjacent to the disclosure to which they relate.
All accounting policies are included within an outlined box.
1.0 Basis of preparation 1.1 General information Bovis Homes Group PLC the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in Joint Ventures.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 20 February 2017.
1.2 Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Group have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC interpretations as adopted by the European Union and Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all relevant periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the Company and the Group where relevant.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and available for sale financial assets which are on a fair value basis.
1.3 Going concern The Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the 12 months from date of approval of these financial statements.
The Directors reviewed detailed financial and covenant compliance forecasts covering the period to December 2017 and summary financial forecasts for the following two years.
Having started the year with net cash of 30.0 million, the Group again generated a strong operating cash flow during 2016, increasing the net cash position to 38.6 million.
As at 31 December 2016, the Group held cash and cash equivalents of 38.6 million and had no borrowings.
On 3 December 2015, the Group entered into a new 250 million committed revolving credit facility that was extended for one year during 2016, now expiring in December 2021, all of which was available for drawdown at 31 December 2016.
For these reasons, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Group on a going concern basis.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are any entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the comprehensive income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which the Group and one or more third parties have joint control.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the comprehensive income and expense of Joint Ventures on an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint control commenced until joint control ceases.
These joint arrangement are in turn classified as: Joint Ventures whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities: and Joint operations whereby the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.
1.5 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Bovis Homes Group PLC | 105 Notes to the financial statements continued The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of adopted IFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty for the Group Land held for development and housing work in progress The Group holds inventories which are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
To assess the net realisable value of land held for development and housing work in progress, the Group completes a financial appraisal of the likely revenue which will be generated when these inventories are combined as residential properties for sale and sold.
Where the financial appraisal demonstrates that the revenue will exceed the costs of the inventories and other associated costs of constructing the residential properties, the inventories are stated at cost.
Where the assessed revenue is lower, the extent to which there is a shortfall is written off through the income statement leaving the inventories stated at a realisable value.
To the extent that the revenues which can be generated change, or the final cost to complete for the site varies from estimates, the net realisable value of the inventories may be different.
A review taking into account estimated achievable net revenues, actual inventory and costs to complete as at 31 December 2016 has been carried out, which has identified no material net movement in the carrying value of the provision.
These estimates were made by local management having regard to actual sales prices, together with competitor and marketplace evidence, and were further reviewed by Group management.
Should there be a future significant decline in UK house pricing, then further write-downs of land and work in progress may be necessary.
Further detail on the carrying value of inventories is laid out in note 3.1.
Available for sale financial assets The Groups available for sale financial assets, comprise of a portfolio of shared equity assets.
The estimation of their fair value requires judgement and estimation as to the quantum, timing and value of repayment of the Groups receivable, as well as to the choice of instrument-specific market-assessed interest rate used to determine a discount rate.
Note 4.6 contains a sensitivity analysis showing the impact of a change in the major judgement factors applied in the valuation of these instruments.
Defined benefit pension scheme The Group has an active defined benefit pension scheme, which is subject to estimation uncertainty.
Note 5.7 outlines the way in which this Scheme is recognised in the Groups Financial Statements, the associated risks and sensitivity analysis showing the impact of a change in key variables on the defined benefit obligation.
The Company has no sources of estimation uncertainty.
Customer care provision Following legal completion, the Group provides a two year warranty that covers any defects which arise during that period.
The level of provision per completion is based on actual costs incurred over the preceding twelve months.
Judgement is applied in determining whether this level of provision is sufficient, or whether it should be adjusted to reflect the level of outstanding customer rectification works at the balance sheet date.
1.6 Segment reporting The Chief Operating Decision Maker, which is the Board, notes that the Groups main operation is that of a housebuilder and it operates entirely within the United Kingdom.
There are no separate segments, either business or geographic, to disclose, having taken into account the aggregation criteria provisions of IFRS8.
1.7 Impact of standards and interpretations effective for the first time The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential amendments to other standards, with a date of initial application of 1 January 2015: IFRIC21 Levies and Amendment to IAS 19 Employee benefits on defined benefit plans have both come into effect, with no significant impact on the Group.
Other changes recommended in Annual Improvements 2011, Annual Improvements 2012 and Annual Improvements 2013 have also been implemented with no significant impact on the Group.
106 | Annual report and accounts | Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1.8 Impact of standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2016, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements.
The majority are not expected to have a significant effect on the financial statements of the Group or the Company, and the full effect of the following standards will be assessed during the year ending 31 December 2017: IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction contracts, setting out new revenue recognition criteria particularly with regard to performance obligations which may have some impact on the timing of revenue recognised by the Group on certain contracts.
The standard will be effective for the period beginning 1 January 2018.
IFRS 16, Leases requires lessees to recognise an asset and a liability on its balance sheet for all operating leases above thresholds for the value of the asset and the length of the lease period.
The standard will be effective for the period beginning 1 January 2019.
2.0 Result for the year Revenue Revenue comprises the fair value of consideration received or receivable, net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts.
Revenue does not include the value of the onward legal completion of properties accepted in part exchange against a new property.
The net gain or loss arising from the legal completion of these part exchange properties is recognised in cost of sales.
Revenue is recognised once the value of the transaction can be reliably measured and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
Revenue is recognised on house sales at legal completion.
Revenue is recognised on land sales and commercial property sales from the point of unconditional exchange of contracts.
For affordable housing, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contract activity at the balance sheet date.
When it is probable that the total costs on a construction contract will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense in the Income Statement immediately.
Where land is sold with material development obligations, the recognition of revenue and profit is deferred until the work is complete.
Rental income is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.

The average number of shares is increased by reference to the average number of potential ordinary shares held under option during the year.
This reflects the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option exercise price.
The market value of shares has been calculated using the average ordinary share price during the year.
Only share options which have met their cumulative performance criteria have been included in the dilution calculation.

Liabilities relating to the Groups financing activities are addressed in section 4.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in section 5.
3.1 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads, not including any general administrative overheads, that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated net selling price less estimated total costs of completion of the finished units.
Land held for development, including land in the course of development until legal completion of the sale of the asset, is initially recorded at cost along with any expected overage.
Where, through deferred purchase credit terms, cost differs from the nominal amount which will actually be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability, an adjustment is made to the cost of the land, the difference being charged as a finance cost.
Options purchased in respect of land are capitalised initially at cost and written down on a straight-line basis over the life of the option.
Should planning permission be granted and the option be exercised, the option is not amortised during that year and its carrying value is included within the cost of land purchased.
Investments in land without the benefit of planning consent, either through purchase of freehold land or non refundable deposits paid on land purchase contracts subject to residential planning consent, are capitalised initially at cost.
Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these investments, and provision made to reflect any irrecoverable element.
The impairment reviews consider the existing use value of the land and assesses the likelihood of achieving residential planning consent and the value thereof.
Ground rents are held at an estimate of cost based on a multiple of ground rent income, with a corresponding credit created against cost of sales, in the year in which the ground rent first becomes payable by the leasehold purchaser.
Part exchange properties are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value, and include a carrying value provision to cover the costs of management and resale.

Bovis Homes Group PLC | 109 Notes to the financial statements continued 3.2 Trade and other receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Other debtors include amounts receivable from the Government in relation to the Help To Buy scheme.

The carrying value of amounts due from subsidiary undertakings represents the Companys maximum credit risk.
The directors consider these amounts to be fully receivable at year end.
Receivables which are past due but not impaired are not material.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value.
3.3 Trade and other payables Trade payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value which will be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability is recognised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method.
Government grants Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as to match with the related costs that they are intended to compensate.
Government grants are included within deferred income.

4.0 Financing This section outlines how the Group manages its capital and related financing activities.
4.1 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Group Company 2016 2015 2016 2015 000 000 000 000 Bank balances 363 363 344 344 Call deposits 38,189 31,627 - - Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet and cash flows 38,552 31,990 344 344 4.2 Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets - shared equity Receivables on extended terms granted as part of a sales transaction are secured by way of a legal charge on the relevant property, categorised as an available for sale financial asset, and are stated at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity in retained earnings, with the exceptions of impairment losses, the impact of changes in future cash flows and interest calculated using the effective interest rate method, which are recognised directly in the income statement.
Where the investment is disposed of, or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
Given its materiality, this item is being disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet.
Available for sale financial assets relate to legal completions where the Group has retained an interest through agreement to defer recovery of a percentage of the market value of the property, together with a legal charge to protect the Groups position.
The Group participates in three schemes.
Jumpstart schemes are receivable 10 years after recognition with 3% interest charged between years 6 to 10.
The HomeBuy Direct and FirstBuy schemes are operated together with the Government.
Receivables are due 25 years after recognition with interest charged from year 6 onwards at a base value of 1.75% plus annual RPI increments.
These assets are held at fair value being the present value of expected future cash flows taking into account the estimated market value of the property at the estimated date of recovery.

The impairments relate to changes in expected cash flows as a result of movement in future house price expectations.
4.3 Bank and other loans Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs, and subsequently at amortised cost.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Government grants The benefit on loans with an interest rate below market is calculated as the difference between interest at a market rate and the below market interest.
The benefit is treated as a Government grant.

The final repayment of 2,000,000 was made on 5 January 2016.
Details of facilities On 3 December 2015 the Group entered into a new 250 million committed revolving credit facility and this was extended for one year during 2016, now expiring in December 2021.
The facility syndicate comprises six banks.
The facility includes a covenant package, featuring three covenants covering the Groups gearing ratio, consolidated tangible net worth and interest cover.
These covenants are tested semi-annually as per the previous facility agreement.
The overall financing cost of the new arrangement is marginally better than the previous facility.
4.4 Net financing costs Finance costs are included in the measurement of borrowings at their amortised cost to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The Group is required to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction and production of a qualifying asset, as part of the costs of that asset.
Inventories which are produced in large quantities on a repetitive basis over a short period of time are not qualifying assets.
The Group does not generally produce qualifying assets.

Own shares held by ESOP trust Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP trust are included in the Group financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity through an own shares held reserve.

Reserve for own shares held The cost of the Companys shares held in the ESOP trust by the Group is recorded as a reserve in equity.
During the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group purchased 240,000 shares at a total cost of 2,386,000.
There were 16,089 2015: 198,234 shares awarded under the Groups long term incentive plan that vested during 2016 and accordingly the balance of the own shares held reserve reduced by 153,000 2015: 864,000.
The Group has suspended all rights on shares held by the Group in the Company.
4.6 Financial risk management Group The Group seeks to manage its capital in such a manner that the Group safeguards its ability to continue as a going concern and to fund its future development.
In continuing as a going concern, it seeks to provide returns for shareholders over the housing market cycle as well as enabling repayment of its liabilities as a trading business.
The Groups capital comprises its shareholders equity, added together with its net borrowings, or less its net cash, stated before issue costs.
A five year record of its capital employed is displayed on page 131.
Whilst the blended cost of capital is a factor in the Groups decision making in assessing the right blend of shareholders equity and debt financing, the Group has typically preferred to operate within a framework that features relatively low gearing or cash in hand.
This is because the Group recognises that housebuilding can be cyclical, and higher levels of gearing can create profound liquidity risks.
The Group would seek to manage its capital base through control over expenditure, maintenance of adequate banking facilities, control over dividend payments and in the longer term through adjustments to its capital structure.
An important part of capital management for the Group is its financial instruments, which comprise cash, bank and other loans and overdrafts.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also utilises financial assets and liabilities such as trade payables or receivables that arise directly from operations.
The use of these carries risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Given that the Group trades exclusively in the UK, there is no material currency risk.
The valuation of the Groups available for sale financial assets is also impacted by housing market price fluctuations, giving rise to market price risk.
Company The Company only trades with other Group entities and is only exposed to credit risk on those intercompany balances.
Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business and interest rate swaps are used where appropriate to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group has no exposure to currency risk as all its financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Throughout the year, the Groups policy has been that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
114 | Annual report and accounts | Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued Hedging Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The Group mitigates its exposure to changes in interest rates on a core level of borrowings where appropriate through procuring interest rate swaps, denominated in sterling.
The decision whether to enter into a swap, and the timing of procurement of swaps depends on a number of key variables, on which management form judgements.
These matters include managements view of likely cash flows and indebtedness, interest rate movements and other macro-economic factors looking ahead.
These assumptions are reviewed with the Group Finance Director on a periodic basis prior to any decision being made.
Decisions made by management in this area are discussed with the Board to ensure transparency of decision making.
In July 2013 the Group entered into a 25.0 million cash flow hedge to protect against movements in interest rates.
This hedge expired on 29 January 2016.
Interest rate derivative financial instruments 2016 2015 000 000 Opening fair value - 59 Change in fair value - 59 Closing fair value - - Effective interest rates and repricing analysis The interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial instrument is set out in note 4.3.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rates, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations in the Groups earnings, given that Group borrowings are variable in terms of interest rate.
Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates applying for the full year would not have a material impact on the financial statements.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
There are certain categories of revenue where this is not the case: for instance, housing association revenues or land sales.
The largest single amount outstanding at the year end was 9.6 million 2015: 8.8 million.
The amount is secured against consented land.
The Group retains these outstanding balances as trade and other receivables.
The Group also carries credit risk with regard to available for sale financial assets which it classifies as other receivables.
Whilst material in total, the individual risk is low given the high number of counterparties.
Average exposure per transaction is 24,700 2015: 22,950, and a second charge is retained to protect the Groups interests.
The carrying value of trade and other receivables equates to the Groups exposure to credit risk.
The Groups trade and other receivables and available for sale assets are secured against the following: 2016 2015 000 000 Consented land 17,282 10,092 Second charge against property 28,762 36,469 Unsecured 72,510 84,751 118,554 131,312 In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counter parties before entering into a transaction.
This assessment is based upon management knowledge and experience.
In the event that land is disposed of the Group seeks to mitigate any credit risk by retaining a charge over the asset disposed of, so that in the event of default, the Group is able to seek to recover its outstanding asset.
Company The Companys exposure to credit risk is limited as a result of all outstanding balances relating to companies within the Group.
c. Liquidity risk The Groups banking arrangements outlined in note 4.3 are considered to be adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its medium term cash flow needs, thus mitigating its liquidity risk.

Housing market price risk The performance of the UK housing market affects the valuation of certain of the Groups non-financial assets and liabilities and the critical judgements applied by management in these financial statements, including the valuation of land and work in progress.

Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Land purchased on extended payment terms When land is purchased on extended payment terms, the Group initially records it at its fair value with a land creditor recorded for any outstanding monies based on this fair value assessment.
Fair value is determined as the outstanding element of the price paid for the land discounted to present day.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the period of the extended credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method, increasing the value of the land creditor such that at the date of maturity the land creditor equals the payment required.

Cash flows are assessed taking into account expectations of the timing of redemption, future house price movement and the risks of default.
An instrument-specific market-assessed interest rate is used to determine present value via discounted cash flow modelling.
Fair value of quoted investments is based on the available price of those quoted investments at the balance sheet date.
Bank and other loans Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest flows.
Interest free loans are fair valued using an effective interest rate method.
See note 4.3 for further details.
Interest rate swaps At each period end, an external valuation of the fair value of each interest rate swap is obtained from the relevant swap providers.
Fair values are based on broker quotes which reflect the actual transactions in similar instruments.
Trade and other receivables payables Other than land creditors, other financial liabilities and available for sale financial assets, the nominal value of trade receivables and payables is deemed to reflect the fair value.
This is due to the fact that transactions which give rise to these trade receivables and payables arise in the normal course of trade with industry standard payment terms.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The Group uses an instrument-specific market-assessed interest rate to determine the fair value of financial instruments.
The following table provides an analysis of financial assets and liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets: Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

5.0 Other disclosures This section includes all disclosures which are required by IFRS or the Companies Act which have not been included elsewhere in the financial statements.
5.1 Income tax Income tax comprises the sum of the tax currently payable or receivable and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Recognised in the income statement 2016 2015 Note 000 000 Current tax Current year 32,429 33,117 Adjustments for prior years 2,293 1,497 30,136 31,620 Deferred tax Origination and reversal of temporary differences 5.2 1,126 627 Adjustments for prior year 5.2 4,856 190 Total income tax in income statement 33,866 32,057 Reconciliation of effective tax rate 2016 2016 2015 2015 % 000 % 000 Profit before tax 154,714 160,065 Income tax using the domestic corporation tax rate 20.0 30,943 20.3 32,413 Non-deductible expenses 0.5 856 0.1 200 Other 0.2 354 0.7 1,120 Change in tax rate 0.1 142 - 11 Adjustments to the tax change in respect to the prior year 1.7 2,563 1.1 1,687 Total tax expense 21.9 33,866 20.0 32,057 The UK trading subsidiaries adopted FRS 101 for the 31 December 2015 period.
Transitional adjustments in respect of fair value of available assets for sale and imputed interest on deferred land payments, previously held on consolidation, were reflected in those subsidiary accounts.
The corporation tax computations subsequently filed for the 2015 year end incorporated the transitional adjustments, some of which are required to be spread over 10 years under UK tax legislation.
Consequently the tax charge in the income statement this year includes prior year adjustments to reflect the release of the deferred tax asset previously held on consolidation and a prior year current tax credit for the transitional adjustments deducted in the 2015 tax computations.
118 | Annual report and accounts | Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued Recognised directly in equity 2016 2015 Note 000 000 Relating to actuarial movements on pension scheme 5.2 2,624 17 Relating to share-based payments 5.2 8 31 Relating to shared equity 5.2 909 - Deferred tax recognised directly in equity 3,525 48 5.2 Tax assets and liabilities The tax currently payable or receivable is based on taxable profit or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years.
Taxable profit or loss differs from net profit or loss as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability or asset for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from non-tax deductible goodwill, from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit, and from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in reserves.
Current tax assets and liabilities The current liability of 13,885,000 2015: 16,947,000 represents the remaining balance of income taxes payable in respect of current and prior years.
Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: Assets Liabilities Net 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 Group 000 000 000 000 000 000 Property, plant and equipment - - 273 258 273 258 Non-current trade payables - 2,152 27 - 27 2,152 Available for sale financial assets - 970 714 - 714 970 Employee benefits - pensions 1,120 - - 1,423 1,120 1,423 Employee benefits - share-based payments 132 480 - - 132 480 Provisions 1,407 18 - - 1,407 18 Inventories - - 62 216 62 216 Adjustment on sale to Joint Venture 372 437 - - 372 437 Tax assets liabilities 3,031 4,057 1,076 1,897 1,955 2,160 Bovis Homes Group PLC | 119 Notes to the financial statements continued Movement in temporary differences during the year Balance Recognised Recognised Balance 1 Jan 2016 in income in equity 31 Dec 2016 Group 000 000 000 000 Property, plant and equipment 258 15 - 273 Trade payables 2,152 2,179 - 27 Available for sale financial assets 970 2,593 909 714 Employee benefits - pensions 1,423 81 2,624 1,120 Employee benefits - share-based payments 480 340 8 132 Provisions 18 1,389 - 1,407 Inventories 216 154 - 62 Adjustment on sale to Joint Venture 437 65 - 372 Movement in temporary differences 2,160 3,730 3,525 1,955 Balance Recognised Recognised Balance 1 Jan 2015 in income in equity 31 Dec 2015 Group 000 000 000 000 Property, plant and equipment 332 74 - 258 Trade payables 1,900 252 - 2,152 Available for sale financial assets 411 559 - 970 Employee benefits - pensions 134 1,540 17 1,423 Employee benefits - share-based payments 464 47 31 480 Provisions 90 72 - 18 Interest rate derivative 12 12 - - Inventories 273 57 - 216 Adjustment on sale to Joint Venture 239 198 - 437 Movement in temporary differences 2,645 437 48 2,160 Factors affecting future tax charge A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 21% to 20% effective from 1 April 2015 was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
Further reductions to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and to 18% effective 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015, and an additional reduction to 17% effective 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016.
This will reduce the companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2016 has been calculated based on these rates.
Employee benefits The Group recognises the deficit or surplus on its defined benefits pension scheme under the requirements of IAS19 Revised : Employee benefits.
This has generated a deficit of 6.6 million 2015: surplus of 7.1 million.
As at 31 December 2016, a deferred tax asset of 1,120,000 2015 tax liability: 1,423,000 was recognised.

The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees in the form of share options over shares in the Parent Company.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant calculated using an independent option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest, with a corresponding credit to equity except when the share-based payment is cancelled where the charge will be accelerated.

126 | Annual report and accounts | Financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 5.7 Employee benefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 Revised : Employee benefits.
In respect of defined benefit schemes, the net obligation is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, such benefits measured at discounted present value, less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The discount rate used to discount the benefits accrued is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the Projected Unit Method.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs and credits are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Pension cost note The Company operates a UK registered trust based pension scheme that provides defined benefits.
Pension benefits are linked to the members final pensionable salaries and service at their retirement or date of leaving if earlier.
The Trustees are responsible for running the Scheme in accordance with the Schemes Trust Deed and Rules, which sets out their powers.
The Trustees of the Scheme are required to act in the best interest of the beneficiaries of the Scheme.
There is a requirement that one-third of the Trustees are nominated by the members of the Scheme.
There are three categories of pension scheme members: Active members: currently employed by the Company Deferred members: former employees of the Company Pensioner members: in receipt of pension.
The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit outgoings allowing for future salary increases for active members, revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members and then discounting to the balance sheet date.
The majority of benefits receive increases linked to inflation subject to various caps.
The valuation method is known as the Projected Unit Method.
The approximate overall duration of the Schemes defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2016 was 18 years.
Risks Through the Scheme, the Company is exposed to a number of risks: Asset volatility: the Schemes defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields, however the Scheme invests significantly in equities and other growth assets.
These assets are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, but provide volatility and risk in the short term.
Inflation risk: a significant proportion of the Schemes defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore higher inflation will result in a higher defined benefit obligation subject to the appropriate caps in place.
The majority of the Schemes assets are either unaffected by inflation, or only loosely correlated with inflation, therefore an increase in inflation would also increase the deficit.
However, the caps in place limit the potential impact of higher inflation.
The Trustees and Company manage risks in the Scheme through the following strategies: Diversification: investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
Investment strategy: the Trustees are required to review their investment strategy on a regular basis.
Pensionable Salary cap: Pensionable Salary increases are capped at 2.5% pa.
Therefore, the impact on the Scheme of the Company granting salary increases above 2.5% is limited.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group makes contributions to one defined benefit scheme that provides pension benefits for employees upon retirement.

Each assumption change is considered in isolation, which in practice is unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions are correlated.
Pensionable Salary increases are capped at 2.5% pa, as currently assumed, therefore changing the underlying assumption for future salary increases by 0.5% has no impact on the liabilities Expense recognised in the income statement 2016 2015 000 000 Current service cost 828 937 Administration expenses 294 180 Interest credit 272 109 Expense recognised in the income statement 850 1,008 Assumptions Principal actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date expressed as weighted averages : 2016 2015 2014 Group % % % Discount rate at 31 December 2.6 3.8 3.6 Future salary increases 2.5 2.5 2.5 Inflation - RPI 3.4 3.1 3.1 - CPI 2.4 2.1 2.1 Future pension increases 2.5 2.5 2.5 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 000 000 000 000 000 Present value of defined benefit obligations 125,594 102,160 104,020 91,456 88,400 Fair value of scheme assets 119,004 109,277 103,352 94,693 85,229 Deficit surplus in the scheme 6,590 7,117 668 3,237 3,171 Bovis Homes Group PLC | 129 Notes to the financial statements continued The most recent formal actuarial valuation was carried out as at 30 June 2016.
The results have been updated to 31 December 2016 by a qualified independent actuary.
As part of this valuation exercise, the mortality assumptions for the scheme are now based on the CMI 2015 model with an uplift for future improvements in mortality in line with the medium cohort with a minimum improvement of 1.5%.
These tables imply the following remaining life expectancy at age 63.
Current Current Remaining years of life at 63 age at 43 age at 63 Men 26.5 24.3 Women 28.8 26.4 The Trustees are required to carry out an actuarial valuation every 3 years.
The last actuarial valuation of the Scheme was performed by the Scheme Actuary for the Trustees as at 30 June 2013.
This valuation revealed a funding shortfall of 12.8 million.
The Company agreed to pay annual contributions of 37% of members pensionable salaries each year to meet the cost of future service accrual plus 175,000 per annum to cover administration expenses and premiums for death in service lump sums associated with the Scheme.
To remove the deficit in the Scheme as at 30 June 2013, the Company agreed to pay 2.84 million on 1 December 2013 and a further 10.75 million on 1 January 2015.
The Company therefore expects to pay 1.0m to the Scheme during the accounting year beginning 1 January 2017 to meet the cost of future benefit accrual, administration expenses and premiums for death in service lump sums.
The actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2016 is currently underway, the results of which have not yet been finalised.
Once the 2016 valuation has been finalised a new Schedule of Contributions will be agreed and the contributions required may be different from those described above.
If this is the case, the contributions paid by the Company during the accounting period beginning 1 January 2017 may also be different to those set out above.
5.8 Related party transactions Transactions between fellow subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation, as have transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries during this year.
Transactions between the Group, Company and key management personnel in the year ending 31 December 2016 were limited to those relating to remuneration, which are disclosed in the directors remuneration report which can be found on pages 68 to 80 and in note 5.3.
Transactions between the Group, Company and Joint Ventures are in note 5.5.
5.9 Post balance sheet events On 9 January 2017, David Ritchie, the previous Chief Executive, notified the Group of his intention to leave the Company.
David immediately stepped down as Chief Executive of the Group and as a Board Director but will remain with the Group until 28 February 2017 to assist with the process of transition.
The Board appointed Earl Sibley, the Groups Finance Director, as Interim Chief Executive on the same date and have initiated a process to appoint a permanent successor which is expected to take several months.
