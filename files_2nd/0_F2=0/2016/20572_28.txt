7 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS The denition of exceptional items is contained within Note 1 of the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts.
An exceptional charge of 19 million before tax was recorded in the year to 31 December 2016 in respect of the Groups business priorities implementation.
The business strategy is set out on pages 11 to 33 of the 2016 Annual Report.
The costs comprise 11 million of employee related costs, 7 million of professional fees and 1 million of property related costs.
The employee costs relate to severance costs as well asthecostsof employees who are working full time on the business priorities implementation.
This exceptional charge can be splitintoRental Solutions 10 million, Power Solutions Industrial 3 million and Power Solutions Utility 6 million.
Given the continued decline in the Oil & Gas sector in North America, management reviewed the carrying value of small gas generators used in the Oil & Gas market 685 gas generators rated at 300KW or below.
These generators are used only in North America.
In assessing the impairment, management determined the recoverable amount of the assets based on value in use, and compared this to the carrying amount.
As a result of this, an impairment charge of 30 million before tax was recorded in the RentalSolutions business unit in the year to 31 December 2016.
The future cash ows were estimated in the period to the end of theuseful life of the generators based on the most up to date business forecast including assumptions around rates, utilisation, and costs and discounted using adiscount rate of 8.10% after taxation.
The net book value of these specic generators, which is not impaired, is 10 million.

12 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary Shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trusts which are treatedas cancelled.

These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary Shares during the year.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared withthe number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

The calculation of earnings perOrdinary Share on a basis which excludes exceptional items is based on the following adjusted earnings.

The result of this was to switch Goodwill of 7 million from PSI to PSU.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Goodwill is monitored by management at an operating segment level.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations which use cash ow projections based on the five-year strategic plan approved by management.
The key assumptions for value in use calculations are those relating to expected changes in revenue utilisation and rates and the cost base, discount rates and long-term growth rates are as follows: 2016 2015 Post-tax Pre-tax Long-term Post-tax Pre-tax Long-term discount discount growth discount discount growth EBITDA rate rate rate EBITDA rate rate rate Power Solutions Industrial 95 8.7% 12.0% 3% 102 8.2% 10.6% 2% Power Solutions Utility 291 8.7% 12.0% 3% 266 8.2% 10.6% 2% Rental Solutions 147 8.7% 12.0% 3% 188 8.2% 10.6% 2% Values in use were determined using current year cash ows, a prudent view of the medium-term business strategy and excludes any growth capital expenditure.
A terminal cash ow was calculated using a long-term growth rate of 3%.
On the basis that the business carried out by all CGUs is closely related and assets can be redeployed around the Group as required, a consistent Group discount rate has been used for all CGUs.
As at 31 December 2016, based on internal valuations, Aggreko plc management concluded that the values in use of the CGUs exceeded their net asset value with the highest headroom value being 2 billion and the lowest 240 million.
Given these headroom numbers the Directors consider that there is no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions made in their impairment assessment that would give rise to an impairment.

This resulted in a financial instrument which replaced the net trade receivable balance.
The financial instrument was booked at fair value which reects our estimation of the recoverability of these notes.
This fair value was estimated to be 8 million which when compared to the carrying amount of the net trade receivable of 6 million Gross receivable of 14 million less bad debt provision of 8 million resulted in a release to the income statement of 2 million.
This financial instrument is included in other receivables.
ii The value of trade and other receivables quoted in the table above also represent the fair value of these items.
The carrying amounts of the Groups trade and other receivables are denominated in the following currencies: 2016 2015 million million Sterling 19 20 Euro 98 54 US Dollar 340 248 Other currencies 199 154 656 476 Movements on the Groups provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows: 2016 2015 million million At 1 January 64 55 Net provision for receivables impairment 5 14 Transfer to other receivables refer to Note i above 8 Utilised 5 1 Receivables written off during the year as uncollectible 3 3 Exchange 14 1 At 31 December 67 64 Credit quality of trade receivables The table below analyses the total trade receivables balance per operating segment into fully performing, past due and impaired.

The impact was to reduce the previously stated balances in PSI and increase the balances in PSU as follows: Fully performing 2million, Past due 5 million, Impaired nil and total 7 million.
More details can be found in Note 4.
Ageing of past due but not impaired trade receivables 2016 2015 million million Less than 30 days 71 67 Between 30 and 60 days 51 40 Between 60 and 90 days 34 28 Greater than 90 days 143 77 299 212 The Group assesses credit quality as explained below: Power Solutions Industrial This is a high transaction intensive business and the majority of the contracts in this business are small relative to the size of the Group.
There is no concentration of credit risk in this business and there are a large number of customers who are unrelated and internationally dispersed.
The management of trade receivables is the responsibility of the operating units, although they report monthly to Group on debtor days, debtor ageing and significant outstanding debts.
At an operating unit level a credit rating is normally established for each customer based on ratings from external agencies.
Where no ratings are available, cash in advance payment terms are often established for new customers.
Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis.
The effectiveness of this credit process has meant that the Group has historically had a low level of bad debt in this business.
Receivables written off during the year as uncollectible as a percentage of total gross debtors was 1% 2015: 1%.
Power Solutions Utility This business concentrates on medium to very large contracts.
Customers are mainly state owned utilities in emerging markets.
In many instances the contracts are in jurisdictions where payment practices can be unpredictable.
The Group monitors the risk prole and debtor position of all such contracts regularly, and deploys a variety of techniques to mitigate the risks of delayed or non-payment: these include securing advance payments, bonds and guarantees.
On the largest contracts, all such arrangements are approved at a Group level.
To date the Group has also had a low level of bad debt in the Power Solutions Utility business although the risk of a major default is high.
The total trade receivables balance as at 31 December 2016 for our Power Solutions Utility business was 309 million 2015: 230 million.
Within this balance, receivable balances totalling 53 million 2015: 59 million had some form of payment cover attached to them.
This payment cover guards against the risk of customer default rather than the risk associated with customer disputes.
The risk associated with the remaining 256 million 2015: 171 million is deemed to be either acceptable or payment cover is not obtainable inacost-effective manner.
Rental Solutions This business is similar to the Power Solutions Industrial business above and the management of trade receivables is similar.
Again theGroup hashistorically had a low level of bad debt in the Rental Solutions business.
Receivables written off during the year asuncollectible as apercentage of total Gross Debtors was 2% 2015: 3%.

These include reductions to the main rate to reduce the rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April2020.
Deferred taxes at the balance sheet date have been measured using these enacted tax rates and reected in these financial statements.
A deferred tax liability of 1 million 2015: 1 million has been recognised in respect of unremitted earnings.
The deferred tax relates tonon-recoverable withholding tax which will be suffered on dividends to be paid in 2017.
No other deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries.
It is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings will qualify for the UK dividend exemption and the Group can control the distribution of dividends by its subsidiaries.

A5 Pensions Overseas Pension arrangements for overseas employees vary, and schemes reect best practice and regulation in each particular country.
The charge against profit is the amount of contributions payable to the dened contribution pension schemes in respect of the accounting period.
The pension cost attributable to overseas employees for 2016 was 6 million 2015: 8 million.
United Kingdom The Group operates pension schemes for UK employees.
The Aggreko plc Pension Scheme the Scheme is a funded, contributory, dened benefit scheme.
Assets are held separately from those of the Group under the control of the Directors of Aggreko Pension Scheme Trustee Limited.
The Scheme is subject to valuations at intervals of not more than three years by independent actuaries.
The Trustee of the Scheme has control over the operation, funding and investment strategy of the Scheme but works closely with theCompany toagree funding and investment strategy.
A valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2014 using the Attained Age method to determine the level of contributions to be made by the Group.
The actuaries adopted a valuation basis linked to market conditions at the valuation date.
Assets were taken at market value.
The major actuarial assumptions used were: Return on investments 3.6% Growth in average pay levels 4.8% Increase in pensions 3.2% At the valuation date, the market value of the Schemes assets excluding AVCs was 92 million which was sufficient to cover 92% ofthebenets that had accrued to members, after making allowances for future increases in earnings.
As part of the valuation at 31 December 2014, the Company and the trustees agreed upon a Schedule of Contributions and a Recovery Plan.
Company contributions for benets building up in the future increased from 35.9% to 41.0% on 1 February 2016.
To address the Scheme deficit the Company has already made additional contributions of 1.25 million in 2015 and 2016 and plans to make further additional contributions of1.25 million each year until 2022.
Employee contributions are 6% of pensionable earnings.
The Group has the right to a refund of any pension surplus at the end of the scheme and as such has not recognised an additional liability in accordance with IFRIC 14.
The Scheme closed to all new employees joining the Group after 1 April 2002.
New employees are given the option to join a dened contribution scheme.
Contributions of 2 million were paid to the Scheme during the year 2015: 2 million.
There are no outstanding orprepaid balances atthe year end.

Under this method an individuals attributed benefit for valuation purposes related to a particular exit date e. g. expected date of retirement, leaving service or death is the benefit described under the Scheme, determined using the projected compensation and service that would be used in the calculation of the benefit onthe expected exit date, multiplied by the ratio of credited service as of the measurement date to credited service as of the expected exit date.
The benefit obligation is the total present value assessed using appropriate assumptions of the individuals attributed benets for valuation purposes at the measurement date.
The discount rate was derived using a yield curve approach and based onScheme specic cash ow data from the last formal actuarial valuation to arrive at an appropriate single-equivalent rate.
The fair value of the assets is based on the underlying bid value statements issued by the various investment managers.
The manager statements reect the relevant pricing basis of the units held in the underlying pooled funds.
An alternative method of valuation is the estimated cost of buying out benets at 31 December 2016 with a suitable insurer.
This amountrepresents the amount that would be required to settle the Scheme liabilities at 31 December 2016 rather than the Company continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the Scheme.
The Company estimates the amount required to settle the Schemes liabilities at 31 December 2016 isaround 211 million which gives aScheme shortfall on a buyout basis of approximately 106 million.

A5 Pensions continued Risks to which the Pension Scheme exposes the Group There is a risk of asset volatility leading to a deficit in the Scheme.
Working with the Company, the Trustee has agreed investment derisking triggers which, when certain criteria are met, will decrease corporate bond and xed interest gilt holdings and increase the holding of index linked bonds.
Over time, this will result in an investment portfolio which better matches the liabilities of the Scheme thereby reducing the risk of asset volatility.
However, there remains asignicant level of investment mismatch in the Scheme.
This is deliberate andis aimed at maximising the Schemes long-term investment return whilst retaining adequate control of the funding risks.
Through the Scheme, the Group is exposed to a number of other risks: Changes in bond yields a decrease in corporate bond yields will increase Scheme liabilities.
Ination risk pension obligations are linked to ination and higher ination will lead to higher liabilities.
Life expectancy an increase in life expectancy will result in an increase in the Scheme liabilities.
The measurement of the dened benefit obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in key assumptions as described below: The discount rate has been selected following actuarial advice and taking into account the duration of the liabilities.
A decrease inthe discount rate of 0.5%per annum would result in a 21 million increase in the present value of the dened benefit obligation.
The weighted average duration of the dened benefit obligation liabilities is around 28 years.
The ination assumption adopted is consistent with the discount rate used.
It is used to set the assumptions for pension increases, salary increases and deferred revaluations.
An increase in the ination rate of 0.5% per annum would result in a 20 million increase inthe present value ofthe dened benefit obligation.
The longevity assumptions adopted are based on those recommended by the Scheme Actuary advising the Trustee of the Scheme and reect the most recent mortality information available at the time of the Trustee actuarial valuation.
The increase inthe present value of the dened benefit obligation due to members living one year longer would be 5 million.
There is a risk that changes in the above assumptions could increase the deficit in the Scheme.
Other assumptions used to value thedened benefit obligation are also uncertain, although their effect is less material.
2016 2015 million million Dened benefit obligation by participant status Actives 57 37 Deferreds 51 35 Pensioners 27 20 135 92 The duration of the liabilities is approximately 29 years.
Expected cash ows in future years Expected employer contributions for the year ended 31 December 2017 are 3 million.
Expected total benefit payments: approximately 4million per year for the next 10 years.
