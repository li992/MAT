Other Mining and Industrial Underlying EBITDA from Other Mining and Industrial fell from a contribution of $110 million to a loss of $2 million following the disposal of Anglo Americans interest in the Lafarge Tarmac joint venture in July 2015.
Exploration Exploration expenditure decreased to $107 million 2015: $152 million, reflecting general reductions across all commodities.
The decreases were mainly attributable to an overall reduction in drilling activities.
Corporate activities and unallocated costs Underlying EBITDA amounted to a $14 million loss 2015: $31 million gain, driven primarily by a year-on-year loss of $62 million that was recognised in the Groups self-insurance entity, reflecting lower premium income and higher net claims and settlements during 2016.
This was offset to some extent by an 11% decrease in corporate costs $57 million, of which $56 million represented a foreign exchange gain compared with 2015.
The reduction in corporate costs was mitigated by a 10% decrease in the recharge and allocation of corporate costs to business units of $40 million, reflecting the lower corporate cost base.
