The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identied as the Berendsen plc Executive Board.
Following the strategy review in November 2015 The Berendsen plc Executive Board now manages the business under the Business Lines of Workwear, Facility, Healthcare and Hospitality which are all operating segments.
The groups internal reporting structure is aligned on the same basis and segmental information is presented on a basis consistent with this reporting structure.

Previously a portion of this income was shown as part of cost of sales.
Accordingly revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015, 12.1million has been re-presented to reect the position had this policy been in operation during that year.

With effect from 1 January 2016, the groups structure was reorganised into four Business Lines resulting in a change to the number of operating segments and the composition of the cash generating units CGUs.
The Business Lines are managed and controlled at the operating segment level and each of the operating segments has their own dedicated management team.
The internal group reporting structure was also changed to align with this new Business Line structure.
Going forward, management will monitor goodwill at this operating segment level and as a consequence goodwill has been reallocated on this basis.
Goodwill that can be identied as specic to an operating segment has been included in the operating segment directly.
Under the new Business Line structure we have 46 CGUs which represent the smallest identiable group of assets that generate independent cash ows from other groups of assets.
In 2015 we had 23 CGUs under the previous Core and Manage for Value Business Line structure.
For the purposes of goodwill impairment review, acquired goodwill has been allocated to 4 groups of CGUs being the operating segments.
The operating segments are Workwear, Facilities, Hospitality and Healthcare.
The operating segments identied in 2015 were Workwear, Facility, UK Flat Linen, Scandinavian Flat Linen, Germany and Austria Healthcare, Ireland, Direct Sales, Clinical Solutions and Decontamination.
In 2016, Germany and Austria Healthcare and Clinical Solutions have been reallocated to Healthcare along with the proportion of Scandinavian Flat Linen that relates to Healthcare.
The balance of Scandinavian Flat Linen has been reallocated to Hospitality whilst Ireland is now split across Hospitality, Healthcare and Workwear.
UK Flat Linen has now been reallocated to Healthcare and Hospitality.
The Direct Sale operating segment, reecting the groups interest in Mitre was disposed of during the year note 25.
For reporting purposes, the goodwill has been allocated to the operating segments as outlined below: 2016 2015 Restated Net book Net book Impairment amount of Impairment amount of charge goodwill charge goodwill m m m m Core Growth: Workwear 151.5 132.3 Facility 173.2 152.4 Hospitality 28.1 30.8 Healthcare 54.5 6.4 51.5 Total 407.3 6.4 367.0 143 Berendsen plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 8 Goodwill continued Impairment testing of goodwill The group reviews at each reporting date whether there is an indication that any of the CGUs that contain the operating assets may be impaired in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets.
An annual goodwill impairment test is then carried out by comparing the carrying amount of the operating segments, being the group of CGUs, to which the goodwill relates to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of each operating segment is based on value-in-use calculations which management develop from forecast cash ows based on past performance, market data and its expectation of future market development.
These calculations require the use of estimates and the pre-tax cash ow projections are based on the groups current three-year strategic plan.
The key target assumptions within the strategic plan for each of the CGUs may be summarised as follows: a Sustainable revenue growth, prior to currency impacts, of at least GDP 3%: a Continued margin improvement: and a Targeted investment in plant and machinery for stability and growth in operations Cash ows beyond the three-year period have been extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2% 2015: 2% and are appropriate because these are long-term businesses.
The growth rate of 2% 2015: 2% is broadly in line with long-term GDP estimates for countries that the group operates within.
Projected cash ows have been discounted using pre-tax discount rates of11% 2015: 11%.
The discount rates reect market assumptions for the Risk Free-rates and Equity Risk Premiums and also take into account the net cost of debt.
No reasonably foreseeable change in these assumptions would cause an impairment.
The annual impairment test carried out in the current year showed that the recoverable amount for all groups of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated exceeded the carrying amounts of the groups of CGUs.
At the time of the reallocation of the goodwill an impairment test was carried out which showed that no impairment was required under the old Business Line structure.

In March 2016, the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC issued an agenda decision regarding the treatment of offsetting and cash-pooling arrangements in accordance with IAS 32: Financial instruments: Presentation.
This provided additional guidance on when bank overdrafts in cash-pooling arrangements would meet the requirements for offsetting in accordance with IAS 32.
Following this additional guidance, the Group has reviewed its cash-pooling arrangements and has revised its presentation of bank overdrafts.
Comparatives at 31 December 2015 have been restated, increasing overdrafts and increasing cash balances by 30.3million.
At 31 December 2014 the comparative restatement would have been to increase overdrafts and increase cash in hand by 137.8million.
As this is considered a change in accounting policy the group and Company should present a third balance sheet to capture the opening position at 1 January 2015.
However, having reviewed the guidance management has opted instead to present the impact of cash pooling in this note only, on the basis of materiality, as there is no impact on net assets.

During 2016, this facility was extended for a further year and expires on 19 March 2021.
On 19 February 2015, the group issued further private placement notes to existing US investors for DKK654.8 million and 79.7 million repayable in 2025 at xed coupon rate.
In December 2009, the group issued private placement notes of US$259 million and 25 million.
The US$259 million was immediately swapped into euros.
In 2016, US$30 million and the equivalent Euro swaps were repaid.
In May 2006, the group issued private placement notes of US$250 million which were immediately swapped into a basket of Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
In 2014, US$50 million private placement notes and the associated Danish krone swap were repaid, and a further US$100 million and associated Euro and Swedish krona swaps repaid in 2016.
For further details of the groups derivative financial instruments against its borrowings see note 16.
As underlying currencies have been swapped from US dollars via derivative contracts, the group has a gain on financial instruments see note 16 which is offset by the currency translation loss on the underlying borrowings noted above.
The borrowing under the US private placements 2006 and 2009 of 291.6 million reects the 25 million and the US$329 million translated at the year end sterling to dollar rate.

In May 2006 the group placed US$250 million at xed rates for periods between eight and twelve years, in 2014 US$50 million of this debt was repaid, and a further US$100 million repaid in 2016.
In December 2009 the group undertook a further placement of US$259 million at xed rates for periods between seven and twelve years.
In 2016, US$30 million of this debt was repaid.
In both placements the foreign currency amounts were immediately swapped into other currencies: Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
This is to offset the foreign exchange rate exposure arising on the groups foreign currency assets.
The conversion from US dollars into currency was achieved in two stages.
In the first stage swaps were taken out to convert US dollars to sterling.
All of these swaps have been designated as cash ow hedges, with the exception of one swap from the 2006 placement, which has been designated as a fair value hedge, this swap was repaid in 2014.
In the second stage further swaps were taken out to convert sterling to the required currencies.
These have been designated as hedges of net investment inforeign subsidiaries.
The xed interest rate cross-currency contracts entered into have options exercisable by either party to terminate after five years and ten years if relevant.
The value of the swap at the time would then be cash settled.
During the year in accordance with group policy, the group entered into several forward foreign exchange contracts for the purchase of US dollars in the future at xed rates.
These forward contracts reduce the foreign exchange exposure on the procurement of textiles and capital equipment from Far East suppliers.
Cash ow hedges The derivative asset recognised on these 12 instruments is 68.9 million.
During the year there was a gain of 44.3 million, which has been accounted for within the statement of comprehensive income, and a loss of 1.7 million taken to the hedging reserve.
The fair value will be continuously released to the income statement until the repayment of the private placement.
During the year, a gain of 4.8 million was recognised in the income statement in respect of maturing cash ow hedges.
The forward foreign exchange contracts have resulted in the recognition of a derivative asset of 2.3 million 2015: derivative asset of 0.6 million.
During the year a net gain of 1.7 million 2015: gain of 0.2 million was recognised in equity.
Of this balance, a gain of 1.3 million was recycled in the income statement and a gain of 2.6 million was taken as a basis adjustment against inventory.
153 Berendsen plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 16 Derivative financial instruments continued Net investment hedges The second stage of the US private placement swaps results in sterling being exchanged into Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
At 31 December 2016 the xed rate borrowings vary between rates of 4.45% and 5.57% on the xed European swaps.
These swaps are accounted for as hedges of the groups assets in the relevant countries.
The movement on the derivative asset arising has been accounted for as a component part of currency translation 28.8 million loss.
During the year, a loss of 6.2 million was recognised within currency translation in retained earnings in respect of maturing net investment hedges.
The groups borrowings under its revolving credit facilities are designated as a hedge of its European operations.
The carrying value of the borrowings as at 31 December 2016 was 79.0 million 2015: 40.1 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 6.7 million on translation is taken to reserves as a component part of currency translation.
The further issue of US private placement notes in February 2015 for DKK654.8 million and 79.7 million are also designated as a hedge of its European operations.
The carrying value of the borrowings as at 31 December 2016 was 142.9 million.
The foreign exchange loss of 19.6 million on translation is taken to reserves as a component part of currency translation.
17 Financial risk management 17.1 Financial risk factors The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk: fair value interest rate risk: cash ow interest rate risk and price risk : credit risk and liquidity risk.
The groups overall risk management programmes focus on the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the group finance team under the supervision of the Chief Financial Officer under policies approved by the board of directors.
The Chief Financial Officer identies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the groups operating units.
The board approves written principles for foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk, and the use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and receives regular reports on such matters.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The majority of operations in the group bill their revenues and incur their costs in the same functional currency.
The group faces some currency exposure in respect of the procurement of textiles and capital equipment from Far East suppliers.
The group policy is to enter forward contracts to purchase US dollars based upon the expected purchases.
These derivatives are classied ascash ow hedges.
154 Berendsen plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Overview Our business Responsibility Financial review Risk Governance Financial statements 17.1 Financial risk factors continued The groups policy is not to hedge foreign currency exposures on the translation of its overseas profit to sterling.
Where appropriate, borrowings are effectively arranged in currencies so as to provide a natural hedge against the investment in overseas net assets.
During 2016 and 2015, derivative financial instruments were used to manage foreign currency risk as follows: As at 31 December 2016 Danish Swedish Sterling Euro US dollar krone krona Other Total m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents note 13 143.4 70.5 0.7 19.8 55.3 20.4 310.1 Bank overdrafts 189.9 7.2 22.5 4.3 2.2 226.1 Net cash and cash equivalents 46.5 63.3 0.7 2.7 51.0 18.2 84.0 Borrowings, excluding finance lease liabilities note 15 23.3 67.9 266.6 75.2 79.0 512.0 Finance lease liabilities note 15 0.2 0.3 0.9 1.4 Pre-derivative net debt position 70.0 4.9 265.9 77.9 28.9 18.2 429.4 Derivative effect note 16 1.7 165.3 266.6 14.4 27.6 61.0 Post-derivative net debt position 68.3 170.2 0.7 92.3 56.5 18.2 368.4 As at 31 December 2015 restated Danish Swedish Sterling Euro US dollar krone krona Other Total m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents note 13 2.6 70.2 12.6 54.0 17.6 157.0 Bank overdrafts 23.4 1.0 2.9 3.0 30.3 Net cash and cash equivalents 20.8 69.2 12.6 51.1 14.6 126.7 Borrowings, excluding finance lease liabilities note 15 23.1 64.6 310.0 58.7 40.1 496.5 Finance lease liabilities note 15 0.2 0.2 0.7 1.1 Pre-derivative net debt position 44.1 4.4 310.0 46.1 10.3 14.6 370.9 Derivative effect note 16 0.6 185.1 310.0 12.3 56.7 56.5 Post-derivative net debt position 43.5 180.7 58.4 46.4 14.6 314.4 The exposure to euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone largely relate to our net investment hedge activities as described and shown in note 16. ii Price risk The group is not exposed to any equity securities price risk.
The group may from time to time be exposed to changes in the price of cotton.
To mitigate against this risk the group may enter into forward contracts to buy cotton based textiles at a future date.
Such contracts are not recognised as derivative financial instruments as they are held with the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the entitys expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.
iii Cash ow and fair value interest rate risk The groups interest bearing assets include cash and cash equivalents which earn interest at oating rates.
The groups income and operating cash ows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash ow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at xed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain a majority of its borrowings at xed rate using interest rate swaps to achieve this when necessary.
During 2016 and 2015, the groups borrowings at variable rate were denominated in sterling, euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.
155 Berendsen plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 17.1 Financial risk factors continued The following table sets out the carrying amount, by contractual repricing date or maturity where there is no repricing, of xed rate borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk before taking into account interest rate swaps: As at As at 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 m m Fixed interest rate borrowings In one year or less 0.6 88.1 In more than one year, but not more than two years 81.8 0.3 In more than two years but not more than five years 209.5 178.7 In more than five years 142.5 190.4 434.4 457.5 Floating interest rate borrowings 79.0 40.1 Total borrowings 513.4 497.6 During 2016 and 2015, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows: As at 31 December 2016 As at 31 December 2015 Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents including overdrafts 84.0 84.0 126.7 126.7 Borrowings 434.4 79.0 513.4 457.5 40.1 497.6 Pre-derivative net debt position 434.4 5.0 429.4 457.5 86.6 370.9 Derivative effect i 58.7 58.7 55.9 55.9 Post-derivative net debt position 375.7 5.0 370.7 401.6 86.6 315.0 i Excludes the forward foreign exchange contract derivatives.
b Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a group or local basis as appropriate.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a strong credit rating are accepted.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across geographical areas.
If there is no independent rating, management assesses the credit quality of the customer taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits are set based on internal ratings.
Management monitors the utilisation of credit limits regularly.
Management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful debts.
Treasury related credit risk Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from use of derivative instruments.
As at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
In accordance with our treasury policies and exposure management practices, counterparty credit exposure limits are continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
Management does not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The counterparty exposure under all financial assets including trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial contracts were 312.2 million 2015: 325.0 million.
The group does not hold any collateral as security.
c Liquidity risk Cash ow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the group and is aggregated by group finance.
Group finance monitors rolling forecasts of the groups liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities note 15 at all times so that the group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants where applicable on any of its borrowing facilities.
Such forecasting takes into consideration the groups debt nancing plans, covenant compliance, and compliance with internal balance sheet ratio targets.

d Sensitivity analysis Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK, euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone interest rates and sterling exchange rate on our financial instruments.
We have excluded from this analysis the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of trade receivables and payables, since these are not exposed to risk from the market variables.
This analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of xed to oating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the positions at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended, as all of these varied.
157 Berendsen plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 17.1 Financial risk factors continued The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: a financial derivatives in net investment hedging relationship will not inuence interest or foreign exchange sensitivity analysis: a the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net oating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments: a the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is recorded fully within the income statement: and a changes in the carrying value of financial instruments from movements in exchange rates are recorded fully within equity.
The following table shows the groups exposure to foreign exchange risk as at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, which is a result of increase decrease of 10% movement in foreign exchange gains losses on translation of foreign currency denominated borrowings.
The foreign exchange risk is naturally hedged against the net assets of our operations in Continental Europe.
All foreign exchange on both the borrowings and net assets is taken to reserves where it will offset.

The valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specic estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Specic techniques used to value financial instruments include: a quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments: a the fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows based on observable yield curves: a the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with the resulting value discounted back to present value: and a other techniques, such as discounted cash ow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.

Dened benefit plans The Group operates a number of dened benefit schemes and unfunded schemes.
Of these, the principal schemes are the dened benefit plans in the UK and the unfunded scheme in Sweden.
In 2016 the group has taken the opportunity to reduce its exposure to its ongoing pension deficit in Sweden by freezing the existing liability and funding future accruals through a multiemployer insurance plan linked to the scheme.
This has resulted in a curtailment gain in relation to this scheme of 5.1million, before a tax charge of 1million, which is included within the groups exceptional costs for 2016 see note 4.
Within the United Kingdom, the group now operates only one registered dened benefit pension scheme across its UK entities, the Berendsen DB UK Retirement Benets Scheme.
A triennial valuation was carried out at 1 February 2016 and signed off by the Pension Schemes Trustees in December 2016.
As at the triennial date 1 February 2016 the Scheme was fully funded on an ongoing basis so there was no requirement for additional contributions relating to a recovery plan to be paid into the Scheme.
The next valuation is due in February 2019.
The level of benets provided under this scheme depends on each members length of scheme membership and salary in the final years leading up to retirement.
In the UK plan, the pensions in payment are generally increased by 5% in respect of pre-1 February 1999 membership, and by the retail price index for membership from that date.
benefit payments are made from trustee administered funds.
Plan assets are governed by regulations in the UK, as is the nature of the relationship between the group and the trustees and their composition.
Responsibility for governance of the plan, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies jointly with the company and the trustees.
The trustees must comprise of representatives of the company and plan members in accordance with legislation.
Overseas, there is a comparatively small dened benefit scheme operated in Ireland.
Along with the scheme in Sweden, further unfunded schemes exist within Germany, Norway and Poland.
Under all unfunded schemes the group discharges its pension obligations through schemes administered by insurance companies or government agencies.
The overall deficit on the plans is 39.4 million of which 5.1 million is in respect of the UK.
There is a deficit of 34.3 million on other funded and unfunded plans, of which 28.6 million relates to Sweden.
Where a dened benefit scheme is administered by an insurance company with a collective of other companies and the insurance company is unable to assess the share of the groups pension obligation, the pension scheme has been accounted for as a dened contribution pension scheme.
At the last valuation date the present value of the dened benefit obligation was comprised of 250 active employees, 1850 deferred members and 1395 members in retirement.
Expected contributions, including special contributions, to post employment benefit schemes for the year ended 31 December 2017 are 0.8 million 2016: 1.0 million.
The weighted average duration of the dened benefit obligation across all schemes is 19.0 years 2015: 17.6 years.
The actuarial valuations of the UK scheme, together with the other dened benefit schemes operated by the group have been updated as at 31 December 2016 by qualied actuaries using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS19.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries were: 2016 2015 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 2.8 2.8 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.0 2.8 Discount rate 2.6 3.8 Ination rate RPI 3.0 2.8 Ination rate CPI 2.0 1.8 174 Berendsen plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Overview Our business Responsibility Financial review Risk Governance Financial statements 27 Pension commitments continued Mortality rate Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice, published statistics and experience in each territory.

In the case of the funded plans, the group ensures that the investment position is managed within a framework that considers the Schemes liability prole, funding position, expected return of the various asset classes and the need for diversication.
Within this framework, the groups objective is to ensure that sufficiently liquid assets are available to meet benefit payments and the Schemes assets achieve a return that is consistent with the assumptions made by the Trustees in determining the funding of the Scheme.
A large portion of assets in 2016 consists of equities and bonds, although the Scheme also invests in diversied growth funds and a small amount of cash.
The majority of equities are invested in a globally diversied portfolio of international blue chip entities with a target of 35% UK and 65% overseas.
The other growth assets are the diversied growth funds which have a target of 33% of the overall portfolio.
The remainder of the Schemes assets are invested in corporated bonds.
The trustees sought the employers agreement to implement a Liability Driven Investment portfolio.
This will use specialist assets that employ leverage, to match more of the Schemes liabilities, for a given asset value, than a conventional bond.
This portfolio will be implemented when market conditions become more favourable.
Funding levels are monitored on a quarterly basis and the current agreed contribution rate in respect of active members is 35% ofpensionable salaries.
These contribution rates were set following the completion of the latest triennial valuation of the scheme as at 1 February 2016.
The next triennial valuation is due in 2019 after which further contribution rates will be assessed.

Sensitivities The sensitivity of the dened benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is set out below for the dened benefit schemes and unfunded schemes.
The tables set out the impact on the benefit obligation due to an increase or decrease in the key assumptions.
Dened benefit schemes Change in Increase in Decrease in assumption assumption assumption Discount rate 0.5% 9 % 10% Salary growth rate 0.5% Pension growth rate 0.5% 2% 3 % Life expectancy Change by 1 year 4% 4 % Unfunded schemes Change in Increase in Decrease in assumption assumption assumption Discount rate 0.5% 8 % 9% Salary growth rate 0.5% Pension growth rate 0.5% 9% 8 % Life expectancy Change by 1 year 4% 4 % The above sensitivity analysis are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the dened benefit to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position.

Some of the sites have operated as laundry sites for many years, and historic environmental liabilities may exist, although the group has indemnities from third parties in respect of a number of sites.
The extent of these liabilities and the cover provided by the indemnities are reviewed where appropriate with the relevant third party.
The company is currently defending a legal claim to the warranties received for any environmental damage that might have existed when it purchased laundry sites in Sweden.
The company expects to have its warranties, which were contractually received, to be confirmed in full.
The company does not expect to incur any significant loss in respect of these or any other sites.
In an international group, a variety of claims arise from time to time in addition to those in respect of environmental obligations discussed above.
Such claims may arise due to litigation against group companies, as a result of investigations by scal and competition authorities, or under regulatory requirements.
Provision has been made in these consolidated financial statements against those claims which the directors consider are likely to result in significant liabilities.
There are no contingent liabilities which the directors consider require disclosure.
