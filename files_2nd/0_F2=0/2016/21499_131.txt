The number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells completed at any time during the respective year, regardless of when drilling was initiated.
Completion refers to the installation of permanent equipment for production of oil or gas, or, in the case of a dry well, to reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has been abandoned.
An exploratory well is a well drilled to find oil or gas in a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir.
A development well is a well drilled within the limits of a known oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
A productive well is an exploratory, development or extension well that is not a dry well.
Productive wells include wells in which hydrocarbons were encountered and the drilling or completion of which, in the case of exploratory wells, has been suspended pending further drilling or evaluation.
A dry well hole is an exploratory, development, or extension well that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well.
Oil and gas properties, wells, operations and acreage The following tables show the number of gross and net productive crude oil and natural gas wells and total gross and net developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas acreage as at 30 June 2016.
A gross well or acre is one in which a working interest is owned, while a net well or acre exists when the sum of fractional working interests owned in gross wells or acres equals one.
Productive wells are producing wells and wells mechanically capable of production.
Developed acreage is comprised of leased acres that are within an area by or assignable to a productive well.
Undeveloped acreage is comprised of leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether such acres contain proved reserves.
The number of productive crude oil and natural gas wells in which we held an interest at 30 June 2016 was as follows: Crude oil wells Natural gas wells Total Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Australia 351 177 130 48 481 225 United States 904 506 6,849 2,048 7,753 2,554 a Other 56 23 36 7 92 30 Total 1,311 706 7,015 2,103 8,326 2,809 a Other is primarily comprised of Algeria and Trinidad and Tobago.

Approximately 180 thousand gross acres 83 thousand net acres, 783 thousand gross acres 399 thousand net acres and 7,896 thousand gross acres 4,850 thousand net acres of undeveloped acreage will expire in the years ending 30 June 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively, if the Company does not establish production or take any other action to extend the terms of the licences and concession.
