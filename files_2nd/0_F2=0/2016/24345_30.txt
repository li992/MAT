As part of this process they have considered the associated balance sheet treatment of the fuel hedge contracts which are transacted by the plc company and then contracted back to back through the bus and rail trading subsidiaries.
These were previously treated as if they were passed through to the subsidiaries involved.
Following the review it has been determined that the accounting treatment should be corrected to show the positions contracted with external parties and the corresponding financial asset or liability due from or to the subsidiary involved.
This has had no impact on profit or loss for the period with the offsetting assets and liabilities now recognised in the balance sheet with the comparatives restated.
There has been no change to the accounting policies or practices in the consolidated accounts as a result of this change.
