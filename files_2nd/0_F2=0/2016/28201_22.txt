On the first floor of the building, Polypipes OverlayTM 18mm system was laid directly on top of the existing floors, avoiding the need for additional work to raise or lower the level of the underlying floor.
Each system was paired with a ground source heat pump as they worked in tandem to provide a high performance heating system with excellent energy efficiency.
The use of underfloor heating created a discreet, cost-effective heating system and maximised the visually impressive interior design of the farmhouse due to the removal of radiators.
