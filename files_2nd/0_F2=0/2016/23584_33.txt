Dividends The Directors have become aware of certain technical issues in respect of the Companys procedures for the payment of the final cash dividend of 7.3 pence per share paid on 20 May 2016 and the interim cash dividend of 3.0 pence per share paid on 21 October 2016 the Relevant Distributions.
The Companies Act 2006 the Act provides that a public company may pay a dividend out of its distributable profits as shown in the last accounts circulated to members, or if such accounts do not show sufficient distributable profits, more recent interim accounts which show sufficient distributable profits.
Such interim accounts are also required to be filed at Companies House.
At all relevant times the Company has had sufficient profits and other distributable reserves to justify the Relevant Distributions.
However, the Company did not satisfy certain procedural requirements of the Act before making the Relevant Distributions, as follows: a the Company did not deliver relevant interim accounts to Companies House before making the Relevant Distribution in May 2016: and b the Board made its decision to make the Relevant Distribution in October 2016 based on information which did not meet the requirements for relevant interim accounts under the Act.
In each case this constituted a procedural breach of section 838 of the Act.
Therefore, regrettably, the Relevant Distributions were made otherwise than fully in accordance with the Act.
No fines or other penalties have been incurred by the Company.
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 May 2017, a resolution will be proposed which authorises the appropriation of distributable reserves to the payment of the Relevant Distributions and puts all potentially affected parties in the position in which they were intended to be had the Relevant Distributions been made in accordance with the procedural requirements of the Act.
This resolution constitutes a related party transaction under IAS24 and under the Listing Rules.
The Company has put in place new procedures relating to all distributions which will ensure that relevant legal requirements are complied with at all times.
These procedures have been subject to external legal review and will be regularly reassessed to ensure they remain appropriate.
This matter has no bearing on the financial strength of the Group.
