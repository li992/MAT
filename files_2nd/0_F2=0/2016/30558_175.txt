Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Financial statements 114 Notes to the Company financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 31 January 2016 11 Company financial statements continued 11.19 Adjustments arising on the transition to FRS 101 continued 11.19.2 Comprehensive income Reconciliation of comprehensive income for the 52 week period ended 1 February 2015 f Restated 2015 under UK c d Assets g 2015 under GAAP IAS 19 Deferred tax held-for-sale Loss on disposals FRS 101 m m m m m m Profit before taxation 995 10 3 3 985 Taxation 60 14 46 Profit for the period 1,055 10 14 3 3 1,031 Other comprehensive expense income Items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss: Remeasurement of defined benefit pension schemes 8 10 2 Tax on defined benefit pension schemes 8 10 2 Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss: Cash flow hedging movement 9 9 Tax on cash flow hedging movement 2 2 7 7 Other comprehensive expense for the period, net of tax 15 10 5 Total comprehensive income for the period 1,040 14 3 3 1,026 11.19.3 Notes to the reconciliation of UK GAAP to FRS 101 a Software development costs Software development costs were previously recognised under FRS 15 as a tangible asset.
However, under FRS 101 software development costs meet the recognition criteria required under IAS 38 and should be recognised as intangible assets.
The impact of this adjustment is to reclassify the cost and accumulated depreciation from tangible assets to intangible assets.
b Investment property The Company has investment property relating to rentals to third party tenants.
Under IAS 40, investment property needs to be disclosed separately from tangible assets.
The impact of this adjustment is to reclassify the cost and accumulated depreciation from tangible assets to investment property.
c IAS 19 Under FRS 17, the net pension asset is presented separately net of deferred tax in the balance sheet.
Under IAS 19, the net pension asset with no deduction for deferred tax offset is shown separately on the balance sheet.
The impact of this in the period ending 1 February 2015 was nil 2014: 3m.
In addition, under IAS 19 the amounts charged to the income statement differ to that under FRS 17.
Under IAS 19, administrative expenses are included in the charge whereas under FRS 17 they are recognised in the Statement of recognised gains and losses STRGL.
The measurement of net interest income expense also differs under IAS 19.
Under FRS 17, net interest income expense is calculated as the net of expected returns on scheme assets less interest costs.
However under IAS 19, net interest income expense is calculated by applying the discount rate to the opening net pension asset liability position.
This difference has an offsetting effect on remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income IAS 19 and the actuarial gains or losses recognised in the STRGL FRS 17.
The impact of this in the period ending 1 February 2015 was 10m 2014: 6m.
d Deferred tax Recognising deferred tax based on temporary differences under IAS 12 versus timing differences under FRS 19 has created the following adjustments applicable to the Company: Rolled over gains as at 1 February 2015 the Company had 202m of rolled over gains which would give rise to a deferred tax liability of 40m 2014: 26m.
The rolled over gains relate to where the taxable gain on disposal of tangible assets has been rolled over into the purchase of replacement tangible assets.
No deferred tax liabilities were recognised on these items under FRS 19, but IAS 12 requires recognition on the balance sheet.
The impact of this in the period ending 3 February 2015 was 15m 2014: 7m.
Industrial Buildings Allowances IBAs as at 1 February 2015 the Company had a deferred tax liability of 6m 2014: 7m relating to IBAs claimed on its industrial buildings.
The withdrawal of IBAs in 2004 results in deferred tax liabilities under IAS 12 which are not recognised under FRS 19.
The impact of this in the period ending 1 February 2015 was nil 2014: nil.
Annual report and financial statements 2015 16 115 11 Company financial statements continued 11.19 Adjustments arising on the transition to FRS 101 continued 11.19.3 Notes to the reconciliation of UK GAAP to FRS 101 continued e FRS 101 presentation changes Derivative financial instruments previously derivative financial instruments had been disclosed as part of debtors or creditors under UK GAAP.
However, under IAS 39 derivative financial instruments are disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet.
See note 11.13 for further disclosure.
Deferred tax deferred tax was previously presented as part of provisions on the balance sheet under UK GAAP.
However, under IAS 12, material deferred tax balances are disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet.
See note 11.14 for further disclosure.
Pensions under FRS 17, net pension assets liabilities for the Company were presented under liabilities.
These FRS 101 accounts adopt company law formats and as pension assets do not meet the company law definition of a fixed asset assets of a company which are intended for use on a continuing basis in the companys activities net pension assets are disclosed under current assets.
f Assets held-for-sale Under IFRS 5, an asset is classified as held-for-sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Once an asset is classified as held-for-sale, the asset stops being depreciated at the point it is held-for-sale.
Previously under UK GAAP, the Company had not classified assets as assets held-for-sale as this did not exist under FRS 15.
This adjustment adds back the depreciation which had previously been charged under FRS 15 but should have stopped under IFRS 5 at the point the asset was held-for-sale.
The impact of this in the period ending 1 February 2015 was a 3m credit to the income statement 2014: nil.
Note that under IFRS, a separate line would be required on the face of the balance sheet outside of other assets for assets held-for-sale.
However, this is not consistent with company law formats as required under FRS 101.
As a result, assets held-for-sale have been disclosed as a memorandum underneath the balance sheet.
g Loss on disposals As a result of the application of the assets held-for-sale adjustment as detailed in f above, previous disposal calculations have been adjusted where necessary to take into account the lower depreciation charge.
The impact of this in the period ending 1 February 2015 was a 3m increase to loss on disposals in the income statement 2014: nil.

The overdraft position at 31 January 2016 was 4m 2015: 178m.
The Company has also provided a guarantee in respect of sterling bonds amounting to 426m at fair value 2015: 440m in respect of a subsidiary undertaking.
Where the Company enters into financial contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
11.23 Post balance sheet events On 22 February 2016, the Company repaid its $250m USPP facility of 174m which was due to mature in November 2026.
The Directors consider this event as a non-adjusting post balance sheet event.
