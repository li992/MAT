Principal accounting policies Strategic Report a Basis of preparation Financial The financial statements of SuperGroup Plc the Company and SuperGroup Plc and its subsidiary undertakings in the UK, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, France, India, Hong Kong, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Scandinavia and United States as Our detailed in note 19 the Group have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified Governance by fair values, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted for use in the European Union, and in Statements.
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Financial Statements The current period 2016 is for the 53 weeks ended 30 April 2016 2015: 52 weeks ended 25 April 2015 2015.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and requires Notes to the Group management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies note 2.
These policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented unless otherwise stated.
and Company The Group financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand except where indicated.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidation of the subsidiaries acquired in advance of the Initial Public Offering in March 2010 C-Retail Limited, DKH Retail Limited, SuperGroup Concessions Limited, SuperGroup International Limited, SuperGroup Internet Limited and SuperGroup Retail Ireland Limited into the financial statements of SuperGroup Plc has been prepared under the principles of predecessor accounting, whereby an acquirer is not required to be identified, and all entities are included at their pre-combination carrying amounts.
This accounting treatment leads to differences on consolidation between consideration and fair value of the underlying net assets and this difference is included within equity as a merger reserve.
All subsequent business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting note 1c.
Subsidiaries are those entities in which the Group has power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic benefits.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the period are included in the Group statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are changed when necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The Groups share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value amount of the investment.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
The Group determines, at each reporting date, whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in associate is impaired.
If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to share of profit or loss of investment in the statement of comprehensive income.
Equity investments where the shareholding is less than 20% are accounted for as financial assets at fair value through the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income within Other gains and losses.
Under IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures.
The classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.
Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.

Principal accounting policies continued c Business combinations Financial The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations of entities not under common control.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities Statements.
and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded Notes to the Group as goodwill.
If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
and Company d Foreign currencies The consolidated financial information is presented in pounds Sterling, which is the Companys functional and the Groups Financial Statements.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Resulting exchange gains and losses are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Upon consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items of foreign operations are translated at the actual rate or average rate if not materially different.
Differences on translation are recognised in other comprehensive income.
e Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, or receivable, and represents amounts receivable for goods supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Groups activities, as described below.
Own store revenue Own store revenue from the provision of sale of goods is recognised at the point of sale of a product to the customer.
Own store sales are settled in cash or by credit or payment card.
It is the Groups policy to sell its products to the customer with a right to exchange within 28 days and a full refund within 14 days.
Provisions are made for own store returns based on the expected level of returns, which in turn is based upon the historical rate of returns.
Concession revenue Concession revenues from the provision of sale of goods are recognised gross at the point of sale of a product to the customer.
Concession revenues are settled in cash, by the concession grantors net of commissions or other fees payable.
It is the concessions policy to sell its products with a right to exchange within 28 days and a cash refund within 14 days.

Transactions are settled by credit card, payment card or PayPal.
Our Provisions are made for e-commerce credit notes based on the expected level of returns, which in turn is based upon the historical Governance rate of returns.
Wholesale revenue Financial Statements Wholesale revenues from the sale of goods are recognised at the point that the risks and rewards of the inventory have passed to the customer, which depends on the specific terms and conditions of sales transactions and which are typically upon either dispatch or delivery.
Revenues are settled in cash, net of discounts.
Provisions are made for Wholesale credit notes based on the expected level of returns, which in turn is based upon the historical rate of returns.

h Finance expenses Finance expenses comprise interest payable on interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
Finance expenses are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.
i Leasing and similar commitments Leases are accounted for as operating leases as the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor and the rental charges are charged to the Group statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Lease incentives are received in the form of cash contributions and rent-free periods and are considered financing activities for the purposes of the cash flow statement, as they are the same as financing from landlords to fund store fit-outs.
Cash contributions Cash contributions from landlords for store fit-outs are initially recognised as deferred income in the balance sheet at the point at which the recognition criteria in the lease are met.
They are credited to selling, general and administrative expenses in the Group statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease commencing from opening date.
Cash contributions are not discounted.
Rent-free periods A deferred income liability is built up on the balance sheet during the rent-free period, which is then credited to the Group statement of comprehensive income over the life of the lease.
The effect is to recognise a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the longer of the term of the lease, or from property access date to the end of the lease.
Rent-free periods are not discounted.
Lease premiums Lease premiums paid to landlords are initially recognised as a prepayment, and lease premiums paid to previous tenants are initially recognised as an intangible asset, in the balance sheet, at the point the recognition criteria in the lease are met, and debited to selling, general and administrative expenses in the Group statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease commencing from opening date.

Principal accounting policies continued j Property, plant and equipment Financial Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes the original purchase price and the costs attributable to bringing the asset into its working condition.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds received with the carrying amount and are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write down the cost of the assets, less their estimated residual values, over their remaining useful economic lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years on a straight-line basis Leasehold improvements 5 10 years on a straight-line basis Notes to the Group Furniture, fixtures and fittings 5 10 years on a straight-line basis Computer equipment 3 5 years on a straight-line basis and Company Land is not depreciated.
Residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate.
k Impairment The carrying values of non-financial assets are tested annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows which are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs is estimated.
The recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, and its value in use.
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income whenever the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss in a subsidiary consolidated under predecessor accounting note 1b is recognised as a movement in the merger reserve and retained earnings in addition to recognising a loss on the statement of comprehensive income.
l Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives as follows: Trademarks 10 years Website and software 5 years Lease premiums Over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis Distribution agreements 6 - 23 years Trademarks comprise the external cost of registration and associated legal costs.
Website and software costs consist primarily of externally incurred development costs.
Lease premiums comprise the amount paid to the previous tenant to acquire the lease.
Distribution agreements comprise the fair value, at date of acquisition, of distribution agreements acquired as part of a business combination.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.

the investee after the date of acquisition.
The Groups investment in associate includes goodwill identified on acquisition.
Financial Equity investments where the shareholding is less than 20% are accounted for as financial assets at fair value through the Group Statements statement of comprehensive income.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income within other gains and losses.
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting after initially being recognised at cost in the consolidated balance sheet.
n Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at their fair value and re-measured at fair value at each period end.
Derivative financial instruments are categorised as held for trading.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting.
Foreign forward exchange derivative gains and losses are recognised in other gains and losses net.
o Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Cost comprises costs associated with the purchase and bringing of inventories to the distribution centres and is based on the weighted average principle.
Provisions are made for obsolescence, mark-downs and shrinkage.
p Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised at original invoice amount less impairment losses.
A provision for the impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due, according to the original terms.
Significant financial difficulties of the customer, probability that the customer will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income.

r Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three Statements.
Bank overdrafts are offset against cash when a right of offset exists and the Group uses this right of offset.
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, less overdrafts, which are repayable on demand.
Notes to the Group s Borrowings Borrowings are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs, including facility fees incurred, and subsequently measured at and Company amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Where a loan is obtained at interest rates different from market rates, the loan is re-measured at origination to its fair value, which is calculated as future interest payments and principal repayments discounted at market interest rates for similar loans.
Subsequently, the carrying amount of the borrowings is adjusted for amortisation of the Financial Statements.
origination gain or loss, and the amortisation is recorded as finance income expense using the effective interest yield method on the asset liability.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
t Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is more likely than not that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Provisions are discounted if the impact on the provision is deemed to be material.
u Employee benefit obligations The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for the benefit of its employees.
The Group pays contributions into an independently administered fund via a salary sacrifice arrangement.
The costs to the Group of providing these benefits are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income and comprise the amount of contributions payable to the scheme in the year.
Payroll expense and related contributions Wages, salaries, payroll tax, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group.
v Share based payments The Group operates an equity settled share based compensation plan.
The fair value of the shares under such plans is recognised as an expense in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Fair value is determined using the BlackScholes Option Pricing Model.
The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of share incentives excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are considered as part of the assumptions about the number of share incentives that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest.
The impact of the revision on original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.

Principal accounting policies continued Strategic Report w Trade and other payables Financial Trade and other payables, excluding lease incentives see note 1i, are non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at their fair value which approximates book value.
The policy for current and deferred income tax, when relevant, is as follows: Financial Statements tax on the profit or loss for the period will comprise current and deferred income tax: current income tax expense is calculated using the tax rates which have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years: deferred income tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes: the amount of deferred income tax provided is based on the expected realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date: a deferred income tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised: and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
y Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the balance sheet date only if they have been approved before or on the balance sheet date and not paid.
Interim dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.
z Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity, as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
aa Retained earnings The retained earnings reflect the accumulated profits and losses of the Group.
ab Merger reserve, non-controlling interests and other reserves The merger reserve arose on the Group restructuring in March 2010 and represents the differences on consolidation arising on the adoption of predecessor accounting.
This comprises the difference between consideration paid and the book value of net assets acquired in the transaction less any impairment.
Non-controlling interests relate to business arrangements in which SuperGroup has less than a 100% share.
Other reserves arose on the business combination occurring in Germany regarding former KuH stores.

af Re-measurements The fair value of unrealised financial derivatives is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and unrealised losses gains are recognised as re-measurements within non-underlying items.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the EU requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed below.
a Revision to fair values of business combinations Prior to the anniversary of a business combination the Group may review the fair values originally attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
The key areas of judgement were the valuation of intangible assets and pre-existing relationship, carrying value of fixed assets, levels of provisioning required for acquired inventory and the valuation of trade and other payables.
Details concerning revisions to fair values are outlined in note 6 and note 33. b Exceptional items Judgements are required as to whether items that are both material in size and unusual or infrequent in nature are disclosed as exceptional.

aa Buy-out of USA licence and business combination costs Financial During the comparative period, on 25 March 2015 the Group completed a business combination see note 33 in the USA including Statements the acquisition of trade and assets of 15 Superdry branded stores.
The consideration paid for assets acquired was lower than the assumed provisional fair value of those assets resulting in a 1.0m gain.
The provisional fair values of the assets and liabilities were reviewed within 12 months of acquisition and an adjustment of 0.7m was made to reduce the overall gain from 1.0m to 0.3m.
The acquired inventory was valued at sale price less cost to sell, increasing the value of the inventory at the comparative year-end by 2.5m.
The acquired inventory was sold in the current period.
As part of the business combination a payment was made to terminate the license rights to distribute the Superdry products in North America for 12.4m.
A post-acquisition review of the current and forecast trading performance, and assets of the stores resulted in an onerous lease provision charge of 1.8m and an impairment of assets of 1.1m.
In addition, 0.6m of other related costs, including professional fees, were incurred prior to acquisition.
ab Restructuring During the comparative period restructuring and redundancy costs totalled 2.7m.

The change announced is to reduce the main rate to 17% from 1 April 2020.
Changes to reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020 had already been substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.
As the change to 17% had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date its effects are not included in these financial statements.
The overall effect of that change, if it had applied to the deferred tax balance at the balance sheet date, would be to reduce the deferred tax asset by an additional 0.8m and increase the tax expense for the period by 0.8m.
In the medium term we anticipate that the substantial majority of the Groups earnings will be taxed in the UK.
Included within note 6 is an exceptional tax charge of 1.8m 2015: 0.6m credit, of which 1.4m 2015: 0.1m relates to the impact of the tax rate change on goodwill and intangibles.

The Group has defined its CGUs as Retail and Wholesale.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
During the year, the goodwill on the acquisition of SuperGroup Europe BVBA: SMAC SMAC A S, SMAC Norge A S and SMAC Retail A S : and the German business combination was tested for impairment, with no impairment charges resulting.
The recoverable amounts in 2016 were measured based on post tax value in use 2015: based on post tax value in use.
This methodology is considered reasonable given the significant levels of headroom noted from this assessment.
Detailed forecasts for the next five years have been used which are based on approved annual budgets and strategic projections representing the best estimate of future performance.

Intangible assets continued Strategic Report Key assumptions Financial In determining the recoverable amount it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate the present value of future cash flows.
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with Our relevant external sources of information.
Discount rates Financial Discount rates are derived from the Groups post tax weighted average cost of capital of 10.5%.
The pre-tax weighted cost of Statements capital is 13.6%.
Operating cash flows The main assumptions, which are derived from past experience and external information, within the forecast operating cash flows include the achievement of future sales prices, volumes, raw material input costs and the level of ongoing capital expenditure.
Long-term growth rates To forecast beyond the five years, a long-term average growth rate of 2% has been used: this is not greater than the average longterm retail growth rate for each CGU.
Goodwill sensitivity analysis The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent on estimates and judgements made by management, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
A sensitivity analysis as to potential changes in key assumptions has therefore been performed.
The present values of the future cashflows of the Retail and Wholesale CGUs are significant and are insensitive to any changes to potential changes to key assumptions.

During the year SuperGroup Plc, which owned 20% of Anatwine, sold 50% of the investment to Zalando SE for consideration totalling 1.5m reducing the ownership from 20% to 10%.

Subsequent share capital transactions by other shareholders have diluted the SuperGroup Plc investment to 8%.
The investment in Anatwine has therefore been reclassified from an associate as at 25 April 2015 to a financial asset during the year.
