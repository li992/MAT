The Companys registration number is 7133583, and its registered office is Beech Gate, Millfield Lane, Lower Kingswood, Tadworth, Surrey, KT20 6RP.
The Company has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs as an Investment Trust under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act, 2010 and intends to conduct its affairs so as to continue to be approved.
2 Accounting Policies The Companys Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, to the extent that they have been adopted by the European Union, the Companies Acts that apply to companies reporting under IFRS, IFRC interpretations and, as far as it is consistent with IFRS, with the Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC, in November 2014.
Theaccounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are summarised below.
a Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of investments and derivative assets and liabilities.
b Adoption of new and revised Financial Reporting Standards The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the following Standards and Interpretations were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 9: Financial Instruments IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 16: Leases It is anticipated that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material financial effect on the financial statements of the Company.
c Segmental reporting The Company is engaged in a single segment business and, therefore, no segmental reporting is provided.
d Presentation of the Income Statement In order to reflect better the activities of an investment company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been prepared alongside the Income Statement.
The net revenue profit after taxation is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. e Significant accounting estimates and judgements The Directors make judgements and estimates concerning the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, such as expectations of future events, and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The judgements required in order to determine the appropriate valuation methodology of unquoted equity investments have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.
These judgements include making assessments of the possible valuations in the event of a listing and other marketability related risks.
f Income Income from equity investments and derivative instruments is credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established, normally the ex dividend date.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as a gain in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Special dividends are treated as a revenue receipt or a capital receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
Interest income is accounted for on an accruals basis.
g Foreign currency The Directors, having regard to the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be UK sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in UK sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
All capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserve.

i Finance costs Finance costs comprise interest and fees on bank loans and overdrafts and interest paid on CFDs, which are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method, and dividends paid on short CFDs, which are accounted for on the date on which the obligation to incur the cost is established, normally the ex-dividend date.
Finance costs are allocated equally between revenue and capital.
j Taxation The taxation expense credit represents the sum of current taxation and deferred taxation.
Taxation currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation, as reported in the Income Statement, because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current taxation is calculated using taxation rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred taxation is the taxation expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding taxation bases used in the computation of taxable profit based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted when the taxation is expected to be payable or recoverable, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Taxation is charged or credited to the revenue column of the Income Statement, except where it relates to items of a capital nature, in which case it is charged or credited to the capital column of the Income Statement.
Where expenses are allocated between revenue and capital any tax relief in respect of the expenses is allocated between revenue and capital returns on the marginal basis using the Companys effective rate of corporation tax for the accounting period.
The Company is an approved Investment Trust under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and is not liable for UK taxation on capital gains.
k Dividends paid Dividends payable to equity shareholders are recognised when the Companys obligation to make payment is established.
l Investment held at fair value through profit or loss The portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss, which is initially taken to be their cost, and is subsequently measured as bid or last traded prices, depending upon the convention of the exchange on which they are listed, where available, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations.
Investments which are not quoted, or are not frequently traded, are stated at the Directors best estimate of fair value.
The Managers Fair Value Committee, which is independent of the Portfolio Managers team, provides a recommendation of fair values to the Directors based on recognised valuation techniques that take account of recent arms length transactions in the same or similar investments.
In accordance with the AIC SORP, the Company includes transaction costs, incidental to the purchase or sale of investments within gains on investments held at fair value through profit or loss in the capital column of the Income Statement and has disclosed them in note 10 below.
m Derivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss When appropriate, permitted transactions in derivative instruments are used.
Derivative transactions into which the Company may enter include CFDs, futures, options, warrants and forward currency contracts.
Derivatives are classified as fair value through profit or loss held for trading, and are initially accounted and measured at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value as follows: CFDs the dierence between the strike price and the value of the underlying shares in the contract, calculated in accordance with accounting policy 2 l above: and Futures and options the quoted trade price for the contract.

Any positions on such transactions open at the year end are reflected in the Balance Sheet at their fair value within current assets or current liabilities.
The Company obtains equivalent exposure to Chinese and Hong Kong equities through the use of CFDs.
All gains and losses in the fair value of the CFDs are included in gains on derivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss in the capital column of the Income Statement.
n Amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers Amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
o Other receivables Other receivables include securities sold for future settlement, accrued income and other debtors and pre-payments incurred in the ordinary course of business.
If collection is expected in one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business, if longer they are classified as current assets.
If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Debtors are recognised initially at fair value and, where applicable, subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
p Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents may comprise cash and short-term money market funds which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
q Bank loans Loans are initially included in the financial statements at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of any issue costs relating to the borrowing.

The amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
r Other payables Other payables include securities purchased for future settlement, amounts payable on share repurchases, performance fees payable, investment management and secretarial fees payable, interest payable and other creditors and expenses accrued in the ordinary course of business.
Other payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business, if longer.

s Share premium account and other reserve The full cost of shares repurchased and held in treasury is charged to other reserve.
Where treasury shares are subsequently reissued, any surplus is taken to the share premium account.
t Capital reserve The following are transferred to capital reserve: Gains and losses on the disposal of investments and derivatives instruments: Changes in the fair value of investments and derivative instruments, held at the year end: Foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature: Performance fees: 50% of investment management fees: 50% of finance costs: Dividends receivable which are capital in nature: and Taxation charged or credited relating to items which are capital in nature.
As a result of technical guidance by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in TECH 02 10: Guidance on the determination of realised profits and losses in the context of distributions under the Companies Act 2006, changes in the fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash, without accepting adverse terms at the Balance Sheet date, can be treated as realised.
Capital reserves realised and unrealised are shown in aggregate as capital reserve in the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Balance Sheet.
At the Balance Sheet date all investments held by the Company were listed on a recognised stock exchange and were considered to be readily convertible to cash, with the exception of level 3 investments with a fair value of 20,317,000 2015: 160,000.

Other price risk Other price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through price movements in its investment positions.
The Investment Managers are responsible for actively monitoring the portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seek to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risks arising from derivative positions, mainly to do with underlying exposures, are assessed by the Investment Managers specialist derivative instruments team.

Shortterm flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities if required.
The Company has the facility to borrow up to US dollar 150,000,000 until 14 February 2017.
The current borrowing is shown in Note 13 above.
Other financial liabilities are repayable within one year.
Counterparty risk Certain of the derivative instruments in which the Company may invest are not traded on an exchange but instead will be traded between counterparties based on contractual relationships, under the terms outlined in the International Swaps Dealers Associations ISDA market standard derivative legal documentation.
These are known as Over The Counter OTC trades.
As a result the Company is subject to the risk that a counterparty may not perform its obligations under the related contract.
In accordance with the risk management process which the Investment Managers employ, they will seek to minimise such risk by: only entering into transactions with counterparties which they believe to have an adequate credit rating at the time the transaction is entered into, by ensuring that formal legal agreements covering the terms of the contract are entered into in advance, and through adopting a counterparty risk framework which measures, monitors and manages counterparty risk by the use of internal and external credit agency ratings and evaluates derivative instrument credit risk exposure.
For OTC derivative transactions, collateral is used to reduce the risk of both parties to the contract.
Collateral is managed on a daily basis for all relevant transactions.
At 31 March 2016 3,121,000 2015: 39,032,000 was held by the broker, in government bonds in a segregated collateral account on behalf of the Company, to reduce the credit risk exposure of the Company and 12,740,000 2015: 1,383,000, was held by the Company in cash, shown as Amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers on the Balance Sheet, in a segregated collateral account on behalf of the broker, to reduce the credit risk exposure of the broker.
Credit risk Financial instruments may be adversely affected if any of the institutions with which money is deposited suffer insolvency or other financial difficulties.
All transactions are carried out with brokers that have been approved by the Investment Managers and are settled on a delivery versus payment basis.
Limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker and are kept under review by the Investment Managers.
Exposure to credit risk arises on outstanding security transactions, derivative instruments and cash at bank.
Derivative instruments risk A Derivative Instrument Charter, including an appendix entitled Derivative Risk Measurement and Management, details the risks and risk management processes used by the Investment Managers.
This Charter was approved by the Board and allows the use of derivative instruments for the following purposes: to gain exposure to equity markets, sectors or individual investments: to hedge equity market risk in the Companys investments with the intention of mitigating losses in the event of market falls: to enhance portfolio returns by writing call and put options: and to take short positions in equity markets, which would benefit from a fall in the relevant market price, where the Investment Managers believe the investment is overvalued.
These positions distinguish themselves from other short exposures held for hedging purposes since they are expected to add risk to the portfolio.
The risk and investment performance of these instruments are managed by an experienced, specialist derivative team of the Investment Managers using portfolio risk assessment tools for portfolio construction.
RISK SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis Based on the financial instruments held and interest rates at the balance sheet date, an increase of 0.25% in interest rates throughout the year would have increased the loss after taxation for the year and decreased the net assets of the Company by 717,000 2015: decreased the profit after taxation and decreased the net assets by 509,000.
A decrease of 0.25% in interest rates throughout the year would have had an equal but opposite effect.

As explained in Note 2 l and m above, investments and derivative instruments are shown at fair value.
In the case of cash and cash equivalents, book value approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.
The exception is the US dollar denominated bank loan, its fair value having been calculated by discounting future cash flows at current US dollar interest rates.
