Accounting policies The principal accounting policies followed by the Company are set out below: a Basis of accounting The Company's financial statements have been prepared in compliance with FRS102 as it applies to the financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2016 and the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts issued in November 2014 and updated in January 2017.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the modification to a fair value basis for certain financial instruments as specified in the accounting policies below.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis see page 39 and on assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
The financial statements have been presented in Sterling, which is also the functional currency of the Company.
b Investments The Company has adopted the provisions of Sections 11 and 12 of FRS 102 for measuring and disclosing its financial instruments.
"All investments held by the Company are classified as ""fair value through profit or loss"", and are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation IPEVCV guidelines."
For investments actively traded on organised financial markets, fair value is generally determined by reference to Stock Exchange market quoted bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
Purchases and sales of quoted investments are recognised on the trade date where a contract of sale exists whose terms require delivery within a time frame determined by the relevant market.
Purchases and sales of unlisted investments are recognised when the contract for acquisition or sale becomes unconditional.
Unquoted investments are a significant accounting judgement which is stated at fair value by the Directors in accordance with the following rules, which are consistent with the IPEVCV guidelines: All investments are held at the price of a recent investment for an appropriate period where there is considered to have been no change in fair value.
Where such a basis is no longer considered appropriate, the following factors will be considered: i where a value is indicated by a material arms-length transaction by an independent third party in the shares of a company, this value will be used.
64 Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc 65 2.
Accounting policies continued ii in the absence of i, and depending upon both the subsequent trading performance and investment structure of an investee company, the valuation basis will usually move to an earnings multiple basis or, if appropriate, other valuation methods are also used.
The shares may be valued by applying a suitable price-earnings ratio to that company's historic, current or forecast post-tax earnings before interest and amortisation the ratio used being based on a comparable sector, but the resulting value being adjusted to reflect points of difference identified by the investment adviser compared to the sector including, inter alia, a lack of marketability.
At the year end, of the unquoted holdings, 93 per cent were valued using the process explained in i above and the remaining 7 per cent valued using techniques described in ii above.
c Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the period end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss to capital or revenue in the income statement as appropriate.
Foreign exchange movements on investments are included in the income statement within gains on investments.
d Derivatives Derivatives, including forward foreign exchange contracts, are non-basic financial instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in profit or loss.
e Income Investment income has been accounted for on an ex-dividend basis or when the Company's right to the income is established.
Special dividends are credited to capital or revenue in the income statement, according to the circumstances surrounding the payment of the dividend.
UK dividends are accounted for net of any tax credits.
Overseas dividends are included gross of withholding tax.
Interest receivable on deposits is accounted for on an accruals basis.
f Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged as follows 31 December 2015: the Company commenced its operations on 21 April 2015 : any performance fee is allocated to capital investment transactions costs are allocated to capital other expenses are charged wholly to revenue direct issue costs are deducted from the share premium account finance costs are charged wholly to revenue.
g Taxation The charge for taxation is based upon the net revenue for the year.
The tax charge is allocated to the revenue and capital accounts according to the marginal basis whereby revenue expenses are first matched against taxable income arising in the revenue account.
Deferred taxation will be recognised as an asset or a liability if transactions have occurred at the interim reporting date that give rise to an obligation to pay more taxation in the future, or a right to pay less taxation in the future.
An asset will not be recognised to the extent that the transfer of economic benefit is uncertain.
h Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and demand deposits readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts, when applicable, are shown within current liabilities.
Accounting policies continued i Finance costs Finance costs are interest costs on the overdraft facility and are recognised in the profit and loss account within Revenue.

Portfolio management fee Period from Year ended 26 January to 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 '000 '000 Performance fee accrual: 100% charged to capital 0 0 Total 0 0 The Portfolio Manager is entitled to receive a performance fee equal to 15 per cent of any excess returns over a cumulative 10 per cent per annum hurdle rate, subject to a high watermark.
The performance fee is calculated on the following basis.
Where: PF is the performance fee, if any, payable to the Portfolio Manager A is the adjusted net asset value per ordinary share B is the higher of: i the high watermark net asset value per ordinary share and ii the hurdle C is the time weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue since the last performance period in respect of which a performance fee was earned, or if no performance fee has yet been earned, admission In the event that A-B is a negative number, it shall be taken to equal zero.
For these purposes: Performance period means: i the period beginning on the date of admission and ending on 31 December 2015 and ii each subsequent period corresponding to each accounting period of the Company.
Adjusted net asset value per ordinary share means the net asset value per ordinary share on the last business day of each performance period, adjusted by adding back any performance fee accrual in respect of such performance period.
66 Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc 67 4.
Portfolio management fee continued High watermark net asset value per ordinary share means the net asset value per ordinary share as at the last business day of the performance period in respect of which a performance fee was last earned, adding back the effect of any performance fee paid in respect of such performance period or, if no performance fee has yet been earned, the issue price.
Hurdle means the issue price increased, from admission, at a rate of 10 per cent per annum, compounded annually as at the last business day of each performance period pro-rated, in the case of the first performance period, from the date of admission.
The high watermark net asset value per ordinary share and the hurdle will be adjusted to reflect the impact on the adjusted net asset value per ordinary share from a capital return and or dividend and or distribution to shareholders at the time of such capital return and or dividend and or distribution, on a pence per ordinary share basis.
If at any time a potential adjustment event shall occur, the Portfolio Manager and the Company will discuss in good faith what adjustment would be appropriate for the purpose of calculation of the performance fee.
Failing such agreement, the Company will instruct another independent firm of accountants, to report to the Company and the Portfolio Manager regarding any adjustment which in the opinion of the independent firm of accountants, shall be appropriate to be made for the purpose of the calculation of the performance fee.
Potential adjustment event means, in relation to the Company, every issue by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves and every issue by way of rights or bonus and every consolidation or sub-division or reduction of capital or share premium or capital dividend or redemption of ordinary shares, or other reconstruction or adjustment relating to the share capital of the Company or any shares, stock or securities derived therefrom or convertible thereinto and also includes any other amalgamation or reconstruction affecting the share capital of the Company or any shares, stock or securities derived therefrom or convertible thereinto.

Taxation continued The Company is not liable to tax on capital gains due to its status as an investment trust.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
After claiming relief against accrued income taxable on receipt, the Company has a deferred tax asset of approximately 361,079 31 December 2015: 140,191 based on the long-term prospective corporation tax rate of 17% 31 December 2015: 18% relating to excess management expenses of 2,123,996 31 December 2015: 778,836.
The Company has deferred tax assets of approximately 101,846 31 December 2015: nil based on the long-term prospective corporation tax of 17% 31 December 2015: 18% relating to non-trading loan relationship expenses of 599,093 31 December 2015: nil.
It is unlikely that the Company will generate sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise these expenses and therefore no deferred tax asset in respect of either of these expense types has been recognised.
8. Dividend No dividend is payable for the year ended 31 December 2016 31 December 2015: 0.16 pence per share.
Investments For financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into a fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurements in its entirety, which are described as follows: Level 1 t he unadjusted quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable ie developed using market data for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable ie for which market data is unavailable for the asset or liability.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company has early adopted 'Amendments to FRS102: Fair value hierarchy disclosure March 2016 ' published by the FRC.

Risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objectives stated on pages 17 and 18.
In pursuing its investment objectives, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
The Companys financial instruments comprise securities in unquoted and quoted companies, trade receivables, trade payables and cash.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are fluctuations in market price, interest rate, credit, liquidity, capital and foreign currency exchange rate risk.
The policies for managing each of these risks are summarised below.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk see b below, interest rate risk see c below and other price risk see d below.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks.
The Companys AIFM assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
b Currency risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than Sterling the Companys functional currency, in which it reports its results.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the Sterling value of those items.
The AIFM monitors the Companys exposures and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to Sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposures An analysis of the Companys equity investments and liabilities at 31 December 2016 shown at fair value, except derivatives at gross exposure value that are priced in a foreign currency based on the country of primary exposure are shown below: As at 31 December 2016 Investments Derivative Net financial 000 financial assets instruments 000 000 Currency Euro 19,000 17,251 1,749 Norwegian Krone 25,267 23,409 1,858 Swiss Francs 8,090 7,289 801 US Dollar 202,836 183,137 19,699 Total 255,193 231,086 24,107 76 Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc 77 22.
Risk management policies and procedures continued b Currency risk continued As at 31 December 2015 Investments Derivative Net financial 000 financial assets instruments 000 000 Currency Euro 16,547 15,204 1,343 Norwegian Krone 23,282 23,282 Swiss Francs 10,370 10,370 US Dollar 141,544 141,544 Total 191,743 15,204 176,539 Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and the equity in regard to the Company's non-monetary financial assets to changes in the exchange rates for the portfolio's significant currency exposure, being Sterling US Dollar.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: Sterling US Dollar 10 per cent 2015: - 2 per cent These percentages have been determined based on a reasonable estimate of the potential volatility.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the foreign currency financial instruments held at each statement of financial position date.
If Sterling had strengthened against the US Dollar, this would have had the following effect: As at 31 December 2016 2015 US Dollar US Dollar 000 000 Projected change 10% 2% Impact on capital return 1,970 2,831 Return after taxation for the period 1,970 2,831 If Sterling had weakened against the US Dollar, this would have had the following effect: As at 31 December 2016 2015 US Dollar US Dollar 000 000 Projected change 10% 2% Impact on capital return 1,970 2,831 Return after taxation for the period 1,970 2,831 76 Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc 77 22.
Risk management policies and procedures continued b Currency risk continued In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analyses are not representative of the period as a whole, since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Company's objectives.
c Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk specifically through its bank overdraft 2015: cash holdings.
Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable from any cash at bank and on deposits or payable on the bank overdraft facility see note 11b.
The effect of interest rate changes on the earnings of the companies held within the portfolio may have a significant impact on the valuation of the Companys investments.

Due to the insignificant impact of fluctuations in interest rates no sensitivity analysis is shown.
d Other price risk Other price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting similar financial instruments traded in the market.
The Company is exposed to market price risk arising from its equity investments.
The movements in the prices of these investments result in movements in the performance of the Company.
The Board manages the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the AIFM.
The Board meets regularly and at each Board meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the AIFMs compliance with the Companys objectives.
Concentration of exposure to other price risks A sector breakdown and geographical allocation of the portfolio is contained on pages 13 and 14.

Risk management policies and procedures continued e Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk exposure The Companys assets comprise quoted and unquoted equity shares.
While the unquoted equity is intentionally illiquid, the quoted assets comprise readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
For the avoidance of doubt, none of the assets of the Company are subject to special liquidity arrangements.
The investment in unquoted securities may have limited liquidity and be difficult to realise.
At 31 December 2016 the unquoted securities are valued at 368,276,000 31 December 2015: 289,662,000. f Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
The cash is subject to counterparty credit risk as the Companys access to its cash could be delayed should the counterparties become insolvent or bankrupt.
In summary, the exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2016 was as follows: 2016 2015 3 months 3 months or less or less 000 000 Cash at bank 12,008 Debtors 38 326 Total 38 12,334 None of the above assets were impaired or past due but not impaired.
Investment transactions are carried out with a number of brokers, whose credit standing is reviewed periodically by the AIFM, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
Cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high-quality external credit ratings.
