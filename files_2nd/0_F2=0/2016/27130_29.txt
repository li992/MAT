OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 155 NOTES TO THE COMPANY BALANCE SHEET 28.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
Under Section 408 4 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: a cash flow statement and related notes: comparative period reconciliations for share capital, tangible fixed assets and intangible assets: transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries: the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs: the compensation of key management personnel: and capital management.
As the consolidated financial statements of Morgan Advanced Materials plc include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures: IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments in respect of Group-settled share-based payments: and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures.
The Company proposes to continue to adopt the reduced disclosure framework of FRS 101 in its next financial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to the period presented in these financial statements.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss.
Intangible assets Intangible assets that are acquired by the Company are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Software: 3-7 years Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of tangible fixed assets.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Plant, equipment and fixtures: 3 20 years Buildings: 50 years Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the Companys functional currencies at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement except for differences arising on the retranslation of qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
ANNUAL REPORT 2016 MORGAN ADVANCED MATERIALS 156 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE COMPANY BALANCE SHEET continued 28.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Expenses Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company Financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: a t hey include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company: and b where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Companys exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called-up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other debtors, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other creditors.
Trade and other debtors Trade and other debtors are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other creditors Trade and other creditors are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Investments in debt and equity securities Investments in debt and equity securities held by the Company are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in equity in the fair value reserve, except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary items such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses.
When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss.
Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings which include amounts owed to by Group undertakings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
MORGAN ADVANCED MATERIALS ANNUAL REPORT 2016 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 157 28.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Derivative financial instruments and hedging Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged see below.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Fair value hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged even if it is normally carried at cost or amortised cost and any gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised immediately in the income statement even if those gains would normally be recognised directly in reserves.
Employee benefits Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Companys net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets at bid price and any unrecognised past service costs are deducted.
The liability discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA-credit-rated bonds denominated in the currency of, and having maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Companys obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Company, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan, reductions in future contributions to the plan or on settlement of the plan and takes into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements.
Actuarial gains and losses that have arisen since the adoption of FRS 101 are recognised in the period that they occur directly into equity through the statement of comprehensive income.
The Company is the sponsoring and principal employer of two UK defined benefit pension Schemes, the Morgan Pension Scheme and the Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the UK Schemes.
The Company also guarantees certain obligations and liabilities to the employees that currently participate in the two UK Schemes.
During 2016 the Company adopted a new policy to allocate costs associated with the UK pension schemes between itself, as Principal Employer, and the various Participating Employers, based on an evaluation of each entitys share of overall Scheme liabilities.
This ensures that the pension liability is reflected in the entity that employed the participant.
This resulted in a reallocation of 151.5 million of the Schemes net liabilities to the Participating Employers.
Previously all of the Scheme assets and liabilities were recognised on the balance sheet of the Company only.
Further details are provided in note 37.
Share-based payment transactions Share-based payment arrangements in which the Company receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Company.
The grant date fair value of share-based payments awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The fair value of the awards granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
ANNUAL REPORT 2016 MORGAN ADVANCED MATERIALS 158 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE COMPANY BALANCE SHEET continued 28.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Share-based payment transactions in which the Company receives goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer cash or other assets that is based on the price of the Companys equity instruments are accounted for as cash-settled share-based payments.
The fair value of the amount payable to employees is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and at settlement date.
Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised as personnel expense in profit or loss.
Own shares held by The Morgan General Employee Benefit Trust Transactions of the Group-sponsored Morgan General Employee Benefit Trust are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore reflected in the Companys financial statements.
In particular, the Trusts purchases and sales of shares in the Company are debited and credited to equity.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event that can be reliably measured, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures are stated at cost less amounts written off unless they are designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge of foreign currency risk.
In this case they are accounted for at historical cost plus a hedging adjustment recognised in profit or loss for the changes in their fair value attributable to the foreign currency exposure from the date the hedge is designated.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Immediately after issue, debt is stated at the fair value of the consideration received.
Immediately after issue capital instruments are stated after deduction of issue costs.
The finance cost of the debt is allocated to periods over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders funds Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately approved and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
Financial guarantee contracts Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee, at which point a liability would be recognised.
STAFF NUMBERS AND COSTS The average number of persons employed by the Company including Directors during the year was as follows: Number of employees 2016 2015 Directors and corporate staff 48 44 Full details of the Directors remuneration for the period can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 70 to 95.

The principal assumptions are the discount rate and inflation assumptions which are long-term and measured on external factors, based upon each plans duration.
In addition to these, the mortality assumption in the UK is material to the cost of the promised benefits.
The assumed increases in salaries and pensions in payment are derived from assumed future inflation.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS: PENSIONS continued Principal actuarial assumptions at the year end were as follows: 2016 2015 Assumptions: % % Inflation RPI & CPI 3.20 2.10 3.00 1.80 Discount rate 2.62 3.70 Pensions increase 3.00 3.10 3.70 2.90 3.10 3.70 Salary increase n a n a Mortality post-retirement: Life expectancy of a male aged 60 in accounting year 26.8 years 26.6 years Life expectancy of a male aged 60 in accounting year 20 28.7 years 28.2 years History of the plans The history of the plans are as follows: 2016 2015 Balance sheet m m Present value of the defined benefit obligation 194.4 500.9 Fair value of plan assets 143.4 383.5 Deficit 51.0 117.4 Funding The most recent full actuarial valuations of the UK Schemes were undertaken as at March 2013 and resulted in combined assessed deficits of 82 million.
On the basis of these full valuations, the Trustees of the UK Schemes, having consulted with the Group, agreed past service deficit recovery payments totalling 7 million a year in 2016 17, across all employers, increasing by 2.75% pa until 2023, and contributions in respect of future service as accrued.
New full valuations are due with effective dates of March 2016 and the outcome of those consultations, which are underway, will determine the Groups future contribution requirements, with any new deficit arising needing to be met through the payment of additional contributions.
The Group expects these valuations to have been completed by June 2017.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivities of the Companys net balance sheet to the principal assumptions are: 2016 2015 Increase effect Increase effect Change in assumption m m Discount rate Decrease by 0.1% 2.4 7.0 Inflation Increase by 0.1% 1.1 4.0 Mortality post-retirement Pensioners live 1 year longer 5.1 12.0 These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the net balance sheet in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date.
This is unlikely in practice for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the assets held by the Companys Schemes.
Defined contribution plans The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan the Morgan Group Personal Pension Plan.
The total Company expense relating to this plan in 2016 was 0.1 million 2015: 0.1 million.

CONTINGENCIES Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
The Group has been subject to legal claims in a number of countries.
In some cases it will not be possible to form a view, either because the facts are unclear or because further time is needed to properly assess the merits of the case, and no provisions are held against such cases.
The Board, having taken legal advice, is of the opinion that the remainder of these actions will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position.
There are no other contingent liabilities in the Company as at 31 December 2016.
