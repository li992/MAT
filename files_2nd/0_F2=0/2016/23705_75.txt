Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements 163 iii Other information on deferred tax assets and liabilities As set out in note 5, there are a number of critical judgments in assessing the recognition of deferred tax assets.
The Group has not recognised assets of US$142m 2015: US$132m in respect of losses that could be utilised against future taxable income and assets of US$10m 2015: US$10m in respect of capital losses that could be utilised against future taxable gains.
Whilst these losses are available indefinitely, they have arisen in undertakings in which it is not currently anticipated that future benefit will be available from their use.
There are retained earnings of US$13,322m 2015: US$12,619m in subsidiary undertakings which would be subject to tax if remitted to Experian plc.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on these because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Given the mix of countries and tax rates, it is not practicable to determine the impact of such remittance.
The main rate of UK corporation tax was reduced to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015.
Further reductions will reduce the rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020.
These further reductions had been substantively enacted at 31 March 2016.
Whilst their effects are recognised in these financial statements, deferred tax arising in the UK has been principally provided at 20% 2015: 20%.
