Recognition and measurement Regardless of the type of inventory and its stage in the production process, inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined primarily on the basis of average costs.
For processed inventories, cost is derived on an absorption costing basis.
Cost comprises costs of purchasing raw materials and costs of production, including attributable mining and manufacturing overheads taking into consideration normal operating capacity.
Minerals inventory quantities are assessed primarily through surveys and assays, while petroleum inventory quantities are derived through flow rate or tank volume measurement and the composition is derived via sample analysis.
Key judgements and estimates Accounting for inventory involves the use of judgements and estimates, particularly related to the measurement and valuation of inventory on hand within the production process.
Certain estimates, including expected metal recoveries and work in progress volumes, are calculated by engineers using available industry, engineering and scientific data.
Estimates used are periodically reassessed by the Group taking into account technical analysis and historical performance.
Changes in estimates are adjusted for on a prospective basis.
During the period, estimates of recoverable copper in the Escondida sulphide leach pad were increased to reflect higher than expected recovery as a result of operational improvements and enhanced information about pad performance.
The impact on after tax profit for FY2016 is US$269 million and is expected to be approximately US$288 million in FY2017.
