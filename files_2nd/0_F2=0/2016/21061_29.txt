Particular focus is given to management of working capital.
Details of the groups borrowing facilities are given in section i on page 140.

They are prepared under the historical cost basis, except that derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value, and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101 and the Companies Act 2006.
These financial statements are the first the Company has prepared in accordance with FRS 101.
Details of the impact of transition are given in note 10.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and certain related party transactions.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements.
As permitted by section 408 4 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the Company has not been included in these financial statements.
The principal accounting policies adopted are described below.
They have all been applied consistently to all years presented.
Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise goodwill arising on business combinations and operating intangibles.
Goodwill is defined under Business combinations on page 103 of the consolidated financial statements.
The Companies Act 2006 requires goodwill to be amortised on a systematic basis over its useful economic life.
Under FRS 101 goodwill isnot amortised, but is instead reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever there are indicators of impairment.
The Company istherefore invoking atrue and fair view override to overcome the requirement to amortise goodwill in the Companies Act 2006.
Had the Company amortised goodwill, a period of three years would have been chosen as its useful life from the date of transition.
The profit for theyear would have been 5m lower had goodwill been amortised in the year.
Intangible assets other than goodwill are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges.
Amortisation ischarged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets from thedate they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are generally deemed to be no longer than five years.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities, except for derivatives, are measured initially at fair value, plus directly attributable transaction costs, and thereafter at amortised cost.
Derivatives Derivatives are used to manage the Companys economic exposure to financial risks.
The principal instruments used are foreign exchange contracts and swaps.
Derivatives are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value based on market prices or rates, or calculated using either discounted cash flow or option pricing models.
Changes in the value of derivatives are recognised in the income statement unless they qualify for hedge accounting when recognition of any change in fair value depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Company operates one defined contribution and two defined benefit pension schemes.
The Company is the principal employer of the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme, which is a funded final salary scheme that is closed to new members, as well as a small unfunded final salary scheme.
For the defined benefit plans, the amount charged in theincome statement is the cost of benefits accruing to employees over the year, plus any benefit improvements granted to members by the Company during the year.
It also includes net interest expense or income calculated by applying the liability discountrate to the net pension asset or liability.
The difference between market value of assets and present value of liabilities isdisclosed as an asset orliability in the balance sheet.
Any related deferred tax to the extent recoverable is disclosed separately in the balance sheet.
Remeasurements are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.
Surpluses are recognised only to the extent that they are recoverable.
Contributions payable by the group in respect of defined contribution plans are charged to operating profit asincurred.
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 152 ACCOUNTING POLICIES for the 53 weeks ended 17 September 2016 Income tax Income tax on profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items taken directly to equity.
Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted during the period, together withany adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using thebalance sheet liability method, usingtax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, providingfor temporary differences between the carrying amounts ofassetsand liabilities for financial reporting purposes and theamounts used for taxation purposes.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only tothe extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Share-based payments The fair value of the share awards at grant date is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity, spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares.
The amount recognised is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting except where the failure to vest is as a result of not meeting a market condition.
Where the Company grants allocations of shares to employees of its subsidiaries, these are accounted for on the same basis as allocations to employees of the Company, except that the fair value is recognised as an increase to investment in subsidiaries with a corresponding increase in equity.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise bank and cash balances, call deposits and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Transition to FRS 101 For all periods up to and including the period ended 12 September 2015, the Company prepared its financial statements in accordance with previously extant United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
These financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 17 September 2016 are the first the Company has prepared in accordance with FRS 101.
The Companys transition date to FRS 101 is 13 September 2014, which is the date from which the changes in accounting policies, restatements and presentational changes required on adoption of FRS 101 have been made.
The comparative financial information for the 52 weeks ended 12 September 2015 has been re-presented in line with FRS 101.
The principal differences between previous UK GAAP and FRS 101 are set out below, in addition to which there are minor presentational differences in the format of the balance sheet.
Goodwill Under previous UK GAAP, goodwill was amortised over its useful economic life.
Under FRS 101, goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life in line with IAS 38 Intangible Assets and is no longer amortised.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
In adopting FRS 101, the Company took advantage of the transitional exemption to use the previous UK GAAP carrying value of goodwill at the transition date 14m as its deemed cost.
The 5m goodwill amortisation previously charged to the income statement for the 52 weeks ended 12 September 2015 has been reversed.
Employee entitlements Under previous UK GAAP, the Company took advantage of the exemption available in FRS 17 to account for contributions arising from its membership of a multi-employer defined benefit scheme as if they were contributions to a defined contribution scheme, on the basis that the Company was unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis.
Under FRS 101, members of a multi-employer defined benefit scheme are required to recognise their share of the costs andnetasset or liability arising under the plan.
Where there is no contractual agreement or stated policy for identifying this allocation to individual member companies, the full amounts are to be recognised in the individual financial statements of the principal employer of the defined benefit scheme.
On transition to FRS 101, the Company has been identified as the principal employer of the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme and has therefore recognised that scheme in full in its individual financial statements.
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 156 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the 53 weeks ended 17 September 2016 Deferred tax Under previous UK GAAP, the liability for a small unfunded defined benefit scheme was presented net of the related deferred tax asset.
Under FRS 101, the deferred tax assets have been separately disclosed.
Other deferred tax assets were previously recognised within debtors but under FRS 101 are separately disclosed along with other deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Equity shareholders funds as at 13 September 2014 At 13 September 2014, a net defined benefit surplus of 87m was recognised in respect of the Associated British Foods Pension scheme, together with a related deferred tax liability of 17m.
The net impact of 70m was reflected against the profit and loss reserve.
Equity shareholders funds as at 12 September 2015 At 12 September 2015, a net defined benefit surplus of 120m was recognised in respect of the Associated British Foods Pension scheme, together with a related deferred tax liability of 24m.
The net impact of 96m was reflected against the profit and loss reserve.
In addition, the 5m goodwill amortisation previously charged to the income statement for the 52 weeks ended 12 September 2015 has been reversed, together with the related tax impact of 1m.
