These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards and IFRIC Interpretations collectively IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union adopted IFRS.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires Management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
Note 1.20 gives further details relating to the Groups critical accounting estimates.
At the date of approval, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue butare only effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2016: IFRS 9 financial instruments classification of financial assets and financial liabilities Amendments to IFRS 11 accounting for acquisition of interests in joint operations Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation IFRS 15 revenue from contracts with customers Amendments to IAS 27 equity method in separate financial statements Improvements 2014 annual improvements to IFRSs: 20122014 Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IFRS 28 investment entities: Applying the consolidation exception Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure initiative IFRS 16 leases IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers is effective for the first time for the Groups financial year commencing 1 October 2018.
TheGroup is currently in the process of assessing the full impact of IFRS 15.
It is not currently practical to quantify the impact of this standard.
The impact of IFRS 16 Leases is to require the Group to record its current head office building and fleet of motor vehicles on the statement offinancial position.
These items are currently treated as operating expenses.
The change in recognition is expected to increase future depreciation charges and lead to a reduction in operating expenses.
All other standards identified above are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
1.2 Adoption of new and revised standards These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the policies set out in the Groups Annual Report for the year ended 30September 2015.
No new or revised accounting standards were adopted in the period.
1.3 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of Zoopla Property Group Plc the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries together the Group.

The results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date control commences until the date when control ceases.
On 28 April 2016 the Group acquired Property Software Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries together Property Software Group from which date the results of Property Software Group have been consolidated.
Therefore, consolidated results for 2016 include five months of performance of Property Software Group and are not a like for like comparison for 2015.
Details of the acquisition are set out in Note 13.
On 1 June 2015 the Group acquired Ulysses Enterprises Limited and its subsidiaries together uSwitch from which date the results of uSwitch have been consolidated.

As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group iswell placed to manage its business and financial risks successfully.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the historical financial information.

Accounting policies continued 1.5 Revenue Revenue represents amounts due for services provided during the period, net of value added tax.
The Group recognises revenue under two categories Property Services and Comparison Services.
Revenue from Property Services derives principally from subscription to the Groups property websites and from the provision of property software to UK domestic estate agents UKAgency revenue, home developers New Homes revenue and overseas and commercial estate agents.
Subscription revenue is recognised over the period of the subscription.
Software revenue includes subscription to Software as a Service SaaS, desktop software licensing, support and installation fees.
Installation fees are recorded at fair value when the installation is complete.
Ongoing SaaS revenue, support and licensing fees are recognised over the service period.
Revenue from other property services is recognised in the month in which the service is provided.
The main sources of Comparison Services revenue are fees received for gas and electricity comparison services Energy revenue and mobile, broadband, pay TV and home phone comparison services Communications revenue.
Revenue is recognised at the point at which the Group generates a lead to an energy or communications provider, based on the historical conversion of such leads into completed switches.
Revenue from other comparison services Other Comparison Services revenue is recognised in the month in which the service is provided.
1.6 Leases During the period the Group entered into a new 15 year lease agreement for the Groups head office at The Cooperage, London.
All of the Groups current lease arrangements are recognised as operating leases as the material risks and rewards incidental to ownership remain with the lessor.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Rent-free periods, lease arrangement fees and other direct costs are amortised through the consolidated statement ofcomprehensive income over the term of the lease.
1.7 Finance income and costs Finance income represents interest receivable on cash and deposit balances.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method.
Finance costs represent interest and certain fees charged on the Groups revolving credit facility.
Finance costs are recognised as they accrue using the effective interest method.
1.8 Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost.
This cost includes the purchase price, directly attributable costs and theestimated present value of any future unavoidable costs of dismantling and removing items.
The corresponding liability is recognised within provisions.
Items of property, plant and equipment are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and are not revalued.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful economic lives, using the straight-line method, as follows: Fixtures and fittings over 2 to 5 years Computer equipment over 2 to 5 years Leasehold improvements over the lease term Freehold property over 50 years The Directors review the residual values and useful economic lives of assets on an annual basis.
1.9 Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses is accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, net of cash acquired.
Acquisition related costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value with the exception of deferred taxassets and liabilities, which are measured in accordance with IAS 12 income taxes.
Identifiable net assets include the recognition of any separately identifiable intangible assets.
Further detail of the identifiable assets and liabilities recognised during the year on the acquisition of Property Software Group and on the 2015 acquisition of uSwitch is provided in Note 13.
Deferred and contingent consideration are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Where the amounts payable are classified as a financial liability any subsequent change in the fair value is charged credited to the Groups consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Amounts classified as equity are not subsequently remeasured.
Where consideration to management shareholders is contingent on their continued employment the amount is recognised as a remuneration expense in the statement of comprehensive income over the deferral period.

Accounting policies continued 1.10 Goodwill Goodwill arising on a business combination represents the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and is recorded as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is not subsequently subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually and whenever the Directors have an indication that it may be impaired.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combination.
Any impairment in carrying value is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
1.11 Intangible assets Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are initially recorded at cost.
Intangibles arising on acquisition are recorded at fair value.
All intangibles are subsequently stated at initial value less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets as follows: Brand 510 years Domain names 5 years Database 310 years Customer relationships 510 years Website development and Computer software 35 years 1.12 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is estimated.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that this increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
1.13 Research and development The Group incurs expenditure on research and development in order to develop new products and enhance the existing websites.
Research expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs are expensed when incurred unless they meet certain criteria for capitalisation.
Development costs whereby research findings are applied to creating a substantially enhanced website or new product are only capitalised once the technical feasibility and the commercial viability of the project has been demonstrated and they can be reliably measured.
Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life.
Once the new website enhancement or product is available for use, subsequent expenditure to maintain the website or product, or on small enhancements tothe website or product, is recognised as an expense when it is incurred.
Research and Development tax credit claims made are recognised as a credit to administrative expenses in the financial year relevant to the claim.
1.14 Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Full details of financial instruments are included in Note 26.
Investments in unlisted securities not meeting the definition of associates, joint ventures or subsidiaries are classified as available for sale financial assets and are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs.
The investments are then remeasured at each subsequent reporting date to fair value.
Changes in the fair value or impairments arising from the significant or prolonged decline in fair value of the unlisted securities are recognised in other comprehensive income.
On disposal of the asset any gains and losses recorded within other comprehensive income are realised and are reclassified to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Trade and other receivables are designated as loans and receivables.
They are recognised at amortised cost, which is net of any allowance for impairment in relation to irrecoverable amounts.
This is deemed to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
The provision is reviewed regularly in conjunction with a detailed analysis of historical payment profiles and past default experience.
When a trade receivable is deemed uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account.
The Group receives interest income on certain amounts held in escrow.
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are designated as other financial liabilities.
They are recognised at their carrying amount, which is deemed to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
Loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost, net of direct costs.
Direct costs are released through the consolidated statement ofcomprehensive income under the effective interest method, along with interest charged, over the life of the instrument.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
The Companys Ordinary Shares are classified as equity instruments and are recognised at the proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
Repurchase of the Companys own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Companys own equity instruments.
Financial instruments are not used for speculative purposes.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents represent amounts held in the Groups current accounts and overnight deposits that are immediately available.
Zoopla Property Group PlcAnnual Report 2016|87 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
Accounting policies continued 1.15 Current tax Current income tax comprises UK income tax and is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Current tax is recognised in the consolidated statement ofcomprehensive income except to the extent that it is required to be recognised directly in equity.
1.16 Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement of financial position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit: and investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference anditis probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which thedifference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that itisrequired to be recognised directly in equity.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date andareexpected to apply when the deferred tax assets are recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle balances on a net basis.
1.17 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Groupwill be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are measured atManagements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the statement of financial position date and are discounted topresent value where the impact is material.
The unwinding of any discount is recognised in finance costs.
Dilapidation provisions are recognised based on Managements best estimate of costs to make good the Groups leasehold properties at the end of the lease term.
Onerous lease provisions relate to contracts whereby the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
The Groups onerous lease provision relates to one of the Groups previous office buildings which was vacated in September 2016.
1.18 Employee benefits: defined contribution benefit scheme The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme which is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a fund.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Contributions payable to the fund are charged to the statement of comprehensive income in the period to which they relate.
1.19 Share-based payments The Group provides equity-settled share-based incentive plans whereby Zoopla Property Group Plc grants shares or nil-cost options over its shares to employees of its subsidiaries for their employment services.
The Group also issues warrants over shares in Zoopla Property Group Plc to a number of the Groups estate agent partners, allowing them to acquire shares in exchange for making their property listings available for inclusion on the Groups property websites.
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and partners are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
Thefair value is measured using a suitable valuation model, including the Black-Scholes and Monte-Carlo valuation models where appropriate, and is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each statement of financial position date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest.
Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted.
The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to meet a market vesting condition.
Detailsregarding thedetermination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions are set out in Note 24.
88|The consumer champion at the heart of the home Financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued 1.19 Share-based payments continued Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in fair value of the options, measured immediately before and after the modification, is charged to the income statement over the remaining vesting period.
Within the company accounts of Zoopla Property Group Plc equity-settled share options granted directly to employees or estate agent partners of a subsidiary are treated as a capital contribution to the subsidiary.
The capital contribution is measured by reference to the fair value of the share-based payments charge for the period and is recognised as an increase in the cost of investment with a corresponding credit to equity.
A number of shares are held in trust in order to settle future exercises of the Groups share incentive schemes.
Details of the trusts are included in Note 24.
Shares held in trust are treated as a deduction from equity.
Employers National Insurance Contributions are accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%.
The amount accrued is based on the market value of the shares at 30 September 2016 after deducting the exercise price of the share option.
1.20 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Management makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the current circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk ofcausing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within future periods are discussed below.
Acquisition of Property Software Group On 28 April 2016 the Group completed its acquisition of Property Software Group.
The process of determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is inherently judgemental and there is a risk that inappropriate methodologies or assumptions could lead to the valuation ofacquired intangibles, goodwill or the fair value of other net assets being misstated.
The details of the assets and liabilities recognised are setout in Note 13.
The Group engaged third party valuations experts to mitigate the risk associated with the valuation of assets and liabilities onacquisition: however, Management judgement remains in the preparation of forecasts and other assumptions which are included within thevaluation model.
Impairment of goodwill and intangibles The Group holds goodwill and intangibles on the statement of financial position in respect of business acquisitions made.
During 2016 the Grouphas recognised intangible assets and goodwill of 75.9 million in respect of the acquisition of Property Software Group.
In 2015 the Group recognised 181.4 million in respect of the uSwitch acquisition.
Acquired intangibles include acquired brands, customer relationships, databases, websites and software.
The Group is required to review these assets annually for impairment.
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired or whether a reversal of impairment of intangible assets should be recorded requires an estimation of the recoverable value of the relevant cash-generating unit, which represents the higher of fair value and value in use.
The value in use calculation requires Management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit, discounted using a suitable discount rate to determine if any impairment has occurred.
A key area of judgement is deciding the long-term growth rate of the applicable businesses and the discount rate applied to those cash flows.
Details of the assumptions used for 2016 are included in Note 14 to the financial statements.
Revenue and accrued income Revenue generated by the Groups Comparison Services division is recognised predominantly from online switching services.
An element ofManagement judgement is required in calculating a revenue accrual which estimates the number of successful switches based on leads provided for each partner in the period between the last date of billing and the latest partner data being made available.
The accrued income isestimated by considering the volume of leads that have passed from the Groups websites to the partner, the historical conversion of such leads into completed switches and contracted revenue per switch.
As at 30 September 2016 the Group holds 17.2 million of accrued income 2015:10.7 million on the statement of financial position.
Revenue from Property Services is predominantly subscription based and therefore there is a lower amount of estimation uncertainty andManagement judgement involved in its recognition and measurement.
1.21 Non-GAAP performance measures In the analysis of the Groups financial performance certain information disclosed in the financial statements may be prepared on a non-GAAP basis or has been derived from amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself an expressly permitted GAAP measure.
These measures are reported in line with how financial information is analysed by Management.
The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures provide a more appropriate measure of the Groups underlying business performance.
The non-GAAP measures are designed to increase comparability of the Groups financial performance year on year.
However, these measures may not be comparable with non-GAAP measures adopted by other companies.
The key non-GAAP measures presented by the Group are: Adjusted EBITDA which is defined as operating profit after adding back depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments and exceptional items Note 3 : and Adjusted basic EPS which is defined as profit for the year, excluding exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets arising onacquisitions, adjusted for tax adjusted profit for the year and divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue for the year Note 11.
Both of these measures are used in determining the remuneration of the Executive Directors and Management.
Zoopla Property Group PlcAnnual Report 2016|89 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2. Business segments The Board of Directors has been identified as the Groups chief operating decision maker.
The monthly reporting pack provided to the Board toenable assessment of the performance of the business has been used as the basis for determining the Groups operating segments.
Whilst the chief operating decision maker monitors the performance of the business at a revenue and Adjusted EBITDA level, depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments, exceptional items, finance income and costs and income tax are all monitored on a consolidated basis.
Asthe Group continues to evolve we will assess the relevance of splitting out Adjusted EBITDA for the Property Services and Comparison Services divisions.
Assets and liabilities are also managed on a centralised basis and are not reported to the chief operating decision maker in a disaggregated format.
The chief operating decision maker monitors six individual revenue streams as set out below.
The six revenue streams are grouped under twoheadings: Property Services and Comparison Services.
Adjusted EBITDA is monitored on an aggregated basis under these two headings.
Revenue and costs shown under the UK Agency heading include trading for the five months from 28 April 2016 to 30 September 2016 of Property Software Group, being the period of consolidation.
Theconsolidated results for 2015 include only four months of performance within the Groups Comparison Services division and are therefore not a like for like comparative for 2016.
Property Services UK Agency revenue, which represents property advertising services and the provision of property software to UK estate agents and lettings agents: New Homes revenue, which represents property advertising services provided to new home developers: Other Property Services revenue, which predominantly represents overseas and commercial property advertising services, display advertising and data services.
Comparison Services Energy revenue, which represents gas and electricity switching services: Communications revenue, which represents mobile, broadband, pay TV and home phone switching services: and Other Comparison Services revenue, which predominantly represents financial services switching, boiler cover, business energy and data insight services.
All material revenues are generated in the UK.

Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is used by Management as a key measure to monitor the Groups business and the Directors believe it should be disclosed on the face of the statement of comprehensive income to assist in the understanding of the Groups underlying financial performance.
Furthermore, the terms of the Groups revolving credit facility require Management to report on the Groups net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio.
Adjusted EBITDA is therefore considered a key performance metric for Management, the providers of the Groups external debt and other stakeholders.
The Group defines Adjusted EBITDA as operating profit after adding back depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments and exceptional items.
Exceptional items include costs and income which Management believes to be exceptional in nature by virtue of their size or incidence.
Such items would include costs associated with business combinations, one-off gains and losses on disposal, and similar items of a non-recurring nature together with reorganisation costs and similar charges.
In 2016 exceptional items related to the acquisition of Property Software Group and the 2015 acquisition of uSwitch.
This is further adjusted for share-based payment expenses which are comprised of charges relating to: i warrants issued to certain of the Groups partners: and ii employee incentive plans which are aimed at retaining staff and aligning employee objectives with those of the Group.
The Directors consider that excluding share-based payments and other non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortisation in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA gives a more appropriate measure of the Groups underlying financial performance and a closer approximation to the Groups operating cash flows.

They reflect Managements expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance.
Cash flows beyond the three year period have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.
A growth rate of 3% has been applied to extrapolate the cash flows into perpetuity.
Growth has been capped at 3% across both business unitsso as not to exceed the long-term expected growth rate of the country and industry the Group operates in, in accordance with IAS 36.
Thepre-tax discount rate was used for each CGU was in the range 10.1% to 14.2%.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of each CGUs assets exceeds their carrying value, as such no impairment was identified.
The Directors are comfortable that a reasonable change in the underlying assumptions would not indicate an impairment.
Amending the analysis such that a growth rate into perpetuity of negative 3%, or a reasonable increase in discount rate, is applied across all CGUs whilst holding all other variables constant would still not give rise to an impairment.

Zoopla Property Group PlcAnnual Report 2016|107 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 26.
Financial instruments Carrying amount and fair value of financial assets and liabilities All financial assets, including cash and cash equivalents, are designated as Loans and receivables and are held at amortised cost other than Available for sale financial assets which are held at fair value as disclosed in Note 16.
All financial liabilities are classified as Other liabilities and are measured atamortised cost.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets andliabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financialstatements are approximate to their fair values.
Financial risk management The Group is exposed to the following risks from financial instruments: credit risk: market risk: and liquidity risk.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or bank counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of each period was equal to the carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements.
The exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual characteristics of each counterparty.
The potential for customer default varies between the Groups two divisions.
The customer base of the Property Services division is large, so thereis no significant concentration of credit risk.
The Comparison Services division operates in a market with a small number of customers, which creates a concentration of debtor balances, and from time to time the amounts due from one or a number of suppliers may be material.
However, customers within this market are often large energy and telecommunications organisations with high credit ratings and access to significant funds.
The Groups largest customer contributed to 18% 2015: 19% of the Groups trade receivables balance.
The Group manages counterparty risk on its trade receivables through strict credit control quality measures and regular aged debt monitoring procedures.
The Group reserves the right to charge interest on overdue receivables, although it does not hold collateral over any trade receivable balances.
Overdue amounts are regularly reviewed and impairment provisions are created where necessary.
This provision is reviewed regularly in conjunction with a detailed analysis of ageing profile, historical payment profiles and past default experience.
The Group has long-standing relationships with its key customers and extremely low historical levels of customer credit defaults.
The ageing of trade receivables at the period end is as follows: 2016 2015 Gross Provision Gross Provision 000 000 000 000 030 days 4,634 7,205 3160 days 3,154 104 1,234 6190 days 721 151 400 38 91 days 767 125 680 631 Total 9,276 380 9,519 669 In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was granted up to the period end date.
Receivables written-off during the year to 30 September 2016 was 470,000 2015: 333,000.
As at 30 September 2016 receivables of 1,386,000 were past due but not impaired 2015: 1,314,000.
The credit risk associated with bank and deposit balances is mitigated by the use of banks with good credit ratings.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange and interest rates will affect the income and financial management of the Group.
The Group is not exposed to any significant currency risk and there is a minimal interest rate risk on cash and bank balances.
However, the Group has borrowings subject to an interest rate calculated with reference to Libor.
Changes in interest rates therefore impact the financial results of the Group.
The Directors actively monitor interest rate risk and note that interest rates remain at a historical low.
The Directors believe that any reasonable increase in the Libor rate would not significantly impact the Group.
Therefore, the Group does not hedge its interest rate risk at this time.
At 30 September 2016 borrowings of 151.5 million were subject to floating interest rates 2015: 114.0 million.
At 30 September 2016 if Libor were to have increased by 1% throughout the year with all other variables held constant profit before tax would decrease by 1.2 million 2015: 0.4 million as a result of additional interest incurred.
Therefore, the Directors are comfortable that any sensitivity to fluctuations in interest or exchange rates would not have a material impact on the results of the Group.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk refers to the ability of the Group to meet the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled in cash as they falldue.
Management regularly reviews performance against budgets and forecasts to ensure sufficient cash funds are available to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups activities are highly cash generative allowing it to effectively service working capital requirements.
At 30 September 2016 the Group held total cash and cash equivalents of 3.4 million 2015: 19.2 million and net debt of 146.3 million 2015: 93.2 million.
108|The consumer champion at the heart of the home Financial statements 26.
Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk continued The Group has access to a 200.0 million revolving credit facility RCF, of which 151.5 million was drawn-down at 30 September 2016.
The remaining 48.5 million undrawn facility allows the Group to secure additional external financing should it be required.
The total facility requires the Group to meet certain covenants based on the Groups interest cover and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio.
Exceeding the covenants would result in the Group being in breach of the facility, which may lead to the facility being withdrawn.
Management regularly monitors and models covenant compliance and prepares detailed forecasts to ensure that sufficient headroom is available.
The Directors are satisfied that there is reasonable headroom on each of the Groups debt covenant ratios.
The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturities for undiscounted financial liabilities, including interest.
The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to settle.
Where interest rates are variable the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at 30 September 2016.
Treasury and capital risk management The Groups policy is to actively manage its cash and capital structure to ensure that it complies with its current debt covenant ratios, maintainsits current dividend policy and minimises the Groups interest payments by paying down its debt where possible.
Management will consider the use of excess cash, including the payment of special dividends to shareholders and M&A activity, based ontherisks and opportunities of the Group at that time.
The Directors can manage the Groups capital structure through the issue or redemption of either debt or equity instruments and by adjustment to the Groups dividend paid to equity holders.
The Directors believe that the current debt to equity ratio remains appropriate but continue to monitor the efficiency of the capital structure on an ongoing basis.
Operating lease commitments At the statement of financial position date, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2016 2015 000 000 Within one year 3,267 1,139 In the second to fifth year inclusive 13,067 3,565 After five years 27,214 2,306 43,548 7,010 All operating lease commitments are in respect of property leases held by the Group.
Subsequent events On 28 November 2016 the Group entered into an agreement to purchase 100% of the issued share capital of Technicweb Limited for initial consideration of 1.5 million, deferred consideration of 250,000 due 12 months from the date of completion and earn-out consideration basedon performance over a 30 month period post completion.
The acquisition is expected to complete on 30 November 2016.
There have been no other reportable subsequent events between 30 September 2016 and the date of signing of this report.
Ultimate controlling party The Directors are of the opinion that there was no ultimate controlling party in either period presented.
