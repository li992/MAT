JRP Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 156 Reconciliation of IFRS shareholders net equity to EEV 31 December 31 December 30 June 2016 20153 2015 m m m Shareholders net equity on IFRS basis 1,610.6 921.5 814.0 Goodwill 33.1 32.8 32.8 Intangibles 183.9 35.5 37.3 Adjustments to IFRS 58.4 263.8 142.5 EEV net worth 1,452.0 589.4 601.4 Value of in-force business Present value of future profits 674.7 624.4 525.8 Cost of residual non-hedgeable risks 56.3 13.4 11.9 Frictional cost of capital 23.4 31.2 28.6 1 Deferred Tax Asset 31.1 8.7 Time Value of Options and Guarantees 56.5 76.1 2 EEV net of taxation 2,047.0 1,143.8 1,019.3 1 The EEV as at 30 June 2015 and 31 December 2015 was calculated on the previous methodology based on Solvency I, which included a deferred tax asset within the Value In-Force VIF.
The changes to deferred tax assets as at 31 December 2016 have now been included within the adjustments to IFRS line.
2 The Time Value of Options and Guarantees TVOG included within the VIF at 30 June 2015 and 31 December 2015 included an amount reflecting a quantification of the reduction in the yield of lifetime mortgages and the impact this has on the liquidity premium primarily arising from assumption differences between the IFRS valuation and the Solvency I valuation of TVOG.
With the alignment to IFRS, this is no longer required.
3 Extracted from the unaudited interim results for the period ending 30 June 2016.
Life insurance products are, by their nature, long-term and the profit on this business is generated over a significant number of years.
Accounting under IFRS alone does not, in the Groups opinion, fully reflect the value of future cash flows.
Under EEV, the total profit recognised over the lifetime of a policy is the same as that recognised under IFRS but the timing of recognition is different.
The Group considers that embedded value reporting provides investors with a measure of the future profit streams of the Groups in-force long-term business and is a valuable supplement to statutory accounts.
Following the change in solvency regime to Solvency II from 1 January 2016, the Group has prepared its EEV with the covered business being valued consistently with IFRS.
This has resulted in the difference in the adjustments to IFRS relative to prior periods.
For 2016, the adjustments to IFRS reflect certain valuation differences between IFRS and EEV.
