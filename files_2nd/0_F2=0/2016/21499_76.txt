BHP Billiton Annual Report 2016 171 5 Financial Statementscontinued 5 Income tax expense continued Uncertain tax and royalty matters The Group operates across many tax jurisdictions.
Application of tax law can be complex and requires judgement to assess risk and estimate outcomes, particularly in relation to the Groups cross-border operations and transactions.
The evaluation of tax risks considers both amended assessments received and potential sources of challenge from tax authorities.
The status of proceedings for these matters will impact the ability to determine the potential exposure and in some cases, it may not be possible to determine a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of the potential exposure.
The Group presently has unresolved tax and royalty matters for which the timing of resolution and potential economic outflow are uncertain.
Tax and royalty matters with uncertain outcomes arise in the normal course of business and occur due to changes in tax law, changes in interpretation of tax law, periodic challenges and disagreements with tax authorities, and legal proceedings.
Tax and royalty obligations assessed as having probable future economic outflows capable of reliable measurement are adequately provided for at 30 June 2016.
Matters without a probable economic outflow and or presently incapable of being measured reliably are contingent liabilities and disclosed in note 32 Contingent liabilities.
Irrespective of whether the potential economic outflow of the matter has been assessed as probable or possible, individually significant matters are included below, to the extent that disclosure does not prejudice the Group.
