The Group operates in the natural resources industry through five divisions, the principal activities of which during 2016 were: In addition, in such a severe downside scenario, a moderate further amount of liquidity would be required to allow the Group to make the principal repayments due under its debt facilities in the remainder of 2018.

In making the assessment that the Group is a going Advisory Group EFRAG : concern, the Board has considered the Groups cash flow forecasts for the period to 31 March 2018, the outlook for commodity prices, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations: Changes in methods of disposal Amendments to IFRS 5 the assumed ramp up of production from Bozshakol and Aktogay and the principal repayments due under the Groups debt facilities and Financial Instruments, Disclosures Amendments to IFRS 7 the deferred capital payments to NFC in the remainder of 2018.
Applying the exemption for consolidation of subsidiaries that meet the definition of an investment entity Amendments to As previously announced, the Group intends to enter discussions with the banks to achieve a refinancing of the PXF facility in the first IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 28 Investments in Associates half of 2017 with a view to amending the financial covenants to ensure a breach is not triggered and to increase available liquidity by Defined Benefit Plans, Employee Contributions Amendments to IAS 19 extending the facility amount and the duration of the facility.
Based on discussions with lenders, the Board is confident that the banks Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations Amendments to IFRS 11 will view such a refinancing favourably provided the Groups debt service obligations continue to be maintained, which forecasts indicate Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 will be the case.
This conclusion is further supported by the short-term nature of the anticipated covenant breach and the high quality Agriculture: Bearer Plants Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 of the Groups assets, in particular, the Bozshakol and Aktogay mines which have long operational lives and provide large scale output at Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements Amendments to IAS 27 first quartile cash costs.
The waiver obtained to the 31 December 2016 covenant testing and the additional $50 million in commitments Clarification of materiality and aggregation, the presentation of subtotals, the structure of financial statements and the disclosure made available and drawn in December 2016 are further evidence of the support of the Group by its banks.
of accounting policies Amendments to IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements, Disclosure Initiatives The Board is therefore confident that a refinancing of the PXF is achievable on terms that are satisfactory to the Group which would provide adequate liquidity throughout the going concern period to 31 March 2018, even in the event of a sustained reduction in commodity prices and a reasonably possible delay in the expected ramp up at Bozshakol and Aktogay and should allow the Group to make the principal repayments due under its debt facilities and the deferred capital payments to NFC in the remainder of 2018.
In the unlikely event that the Group is not successful in increasing the available liquidity through a refinancing of the PXF as expected, the Board is confident that an amendment or waiver to the financial covenants would be achieved such that the PXF facility continues to be available until its final maturity at the end of 2018.
This conclusion is supported by discussions with lenders and the approval obtained in respect of the waiver of the December 2016 covenant testing.

For management and operational In order to estimate reserves, assumptions are required about a range of geological, technical and economic factors, including quantities, purposes, the Group is organised into five separate businesses as shown below, according to the nature of their operations, end-products grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, commodity prices and exchange and services rendered.
Each of these business units represents an operating segment in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled and reviewed by independent The Groups operating segments are: competent persons as defined in accordance with the JORC Code.

These interpretations may impact estimates over Managing and measuring operating segments the expected timing and quantum of taxes payable and recoverable.
The key performance measure of the operating segments is EBITDA excluding special items, which is defined as profit before interest, taxation, depreciation, depletion, amortisation, mineral extraction tax and royalties, as adjusted for special items.
Special items are those items which are non-recurring or variable in nature and which do not impact the underlying trading performance of the business see note 7.
EBITDA excluding special items is a key non-IFRS measure that the Directors use internally to assess the performance of the Groups segments and is viewed as relevant to capital intensive industries with long life assets.
The Directors also believe that this measure closely reflects the operating cash generative capacity and therefore the trading performance of the business as a whole.
Special items are excluded to enhance comparability of EBITDA excluding special items from period to period.

The Directors believe that MET and royalties are a substitute for a tax on profits, hence their exclusion provides an informed measure of the operational performance of the Group.
The MET incurred at Bozshakol and Aktogay oxide during the pre-commercial production stage of $25 million 2015: $17 million and $9 million 2015: $3 million respectively has been capitalised to property, plant and equipment.
MET incurred on stockpiled clay ore at Bozshakol and included within non-current inventory was $33 million 2015: $11 million.

These losses can be utilised against future taxable profits within the statute of limitations period, which for tax losses is currently five years.

There is no time restriction over the utilisation of tax losses.
Where there is sufficient certainty that a taxable profit will arise in these companies against which the losses can be offset, deferred tax assets are recognised.

f Credit risk Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Groups ordinary course of business and is applicable to all financial assets and commitments due from third parties.
The Group has adopted policies and procedures to control and monitor the distribution of these exposures to minimise the risk of loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
The maximum exposure with respect to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset on the balance sheet.
Credit risk relating to trade receivables Given the number and geographical spread of the Groups ultimate customers and the solvency of major trade debtors, credit risk is believed to be limited in respect of trade receivables.
The Group regularly monitors its exposure to bad debts in order to minimise this exposure.

The Directors believe that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws promulgated in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan and any At 31 December 2016, total capital employed which comprises equity holders funds, non-controlling interests and borrowings contractual terms entered into that relate to tax which affect its operations and that, consequently, no additional material tax liabilities of the Group amounted to $4,313 million, compared to $3,826 million at 31 December 2015.
Total capital employed is the measure will arise.
However, due to the reasons set out above, the risk remains that the relevant tax authorities may take a differing position of capital that is used by the Directors in managing capital.
with regard to the interpretation of contractual provisions or tax law inclusive of corporate income taxes, value added tax and subsoil At 31 December 2016, the Group is in a net debt position of $2,669 million 2015: $2,253 million.
The Group does not have a target debt equity ratio, but has determined a maximum debt capacity based on a ratio of long-term The resulting effect of any positions taken by the tax authorities that differ from those of the Directors is that additional tax liabilities normalised EBITDA which the Board believes establishes a sustainable level of gearing through the commodity cycle.
This ratio is may arise or the timing of refunds due may take longer than expected or may be refused.
However, due to the range of uncertainties reviewed in conjunction with market conditions and prevailing commodity prices in order to ensure an efficient capital structure described above in assessing any potential additional tax liabilities and the timing of refunds, it is not practical for the Directors to estimate that is balanced against the risks of carrying excessive leverage.
the financial effect in terms of the amount of additional tax liabilities, if any, together with any associated penalties and charges for which the Group may be liable.
The Group manages net debt to ensure that it does not exceed two times normalised EBITDA through the commodity cycle with flexibility to allow for up to 2.5 times during periods of major capital investment, where normalised EBITDA excludes special items.
c Environmental contingencies In the medium term, following the Restructuring and during the development and ramp up of the Groups major projects, when a Environmental regulations, including emissions legislation, in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are continually evolving.
The outcome of higher net debt to EBITDA ratio is expected, the Group has suspended this internal ratio.
Included within the debt facilities are financial environmental regulations under proposal or any future environmental legislation cannot be reliably estimated at present.
As obligations covenants related to maximum borrowing levels of the Group determined by reference to net debt to EBITDA and debt to equity are determined, they will be provided for in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
The Directors believe that there are no ratios, minimum tangible net worth of individual Group entities and consolidated gross assets to gross liabilities ratios, for which significant liabilities under current legislation not accrued for in the Groups consolidated financial statements however they recognise compliance certificates are produced.
All financial covenants were fully complied with during the year and up to the date of approval that the environmental regulators in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan may take a differing position with regard to the interpretation of of the financial statements.
As discussed in note 2 a to the consolidated financial statements and in the viability statement, the Group environmental legislation.
The resulting effect is that additional environmental liabilities may arise however, due to the range of is currently in negotiations with the PXF banks over the various amendments to the terms of these loans as certain covenants may be uncertainties, it is not practical for the Directors to estimate any further potential exposures.
The provision that has been made for costs associated with restoration and abandonment of mine sites upon depletion of deposits see note 26, is based upon the estimation of the Groups specialists.
Where events occur that change the level of estimated future costs for these activities, the provision will be adjusted accordingly.

Inventory, usually stockpiled ore that has been extracted and is expected to be further processed 12 months after the balance sheet date, iii Mine stripping costs is included within non-current assets.
Mine stripping costs incurred in order to access the mineral-bearing ore deposits are deferred prior to the commencement of production.
Such costs are amortised over the remaining life of the mine using a unit of production method.
The ongoing mining and development of the open pit mines is generally performed via a succession of individual phases.
The costs of extracting material from an open pit mine are generally allocated between ore and waste stripping in proportion to the tonnes of material extracted.
The waste stripping costs are generally absorbed into inventory and expensed as that inventory is processed and sold.
Where the stripping costs relate to a significant stripping campaign which is expected to provide improved access to an identifiable component of the ore body typically an individual phase within the overall mine plan, the costs of removing waste in order to improve access to that part of the ore body will be capitalised within mining assets.
The capitalised costs will then be amortised in a systematic manner over the reserves that directly benefit from the specific stripping activity.

The Groups most significant financial assets, within the scope of IAS 39, are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
These are typically loans and receivables created by the Group in providing money to a debtor.
Subsequent measurement After initial measurement, loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method EIR.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.
The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the income statement.
Allowance for impairment is estimated on a case-by-case basis.
Derecognition A financial asset is derecognised when the Group loses control over the contractual rights that comprise that asset.
This occurs when the rights are realised, expire or are surrendered.
Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
A financial asset or group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset an incurred loss event and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
ii Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, plus directly attributable transaction costs.
The Groups financial liabilities include trade and other payables, bank overdrafts, loans and borrowings, financial guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.
The Groups most significant financial liabilities, within the scope of IAS 39, are classified as loans and borrowings.
Subsequent measurement Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method after initial recognition.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised, as well as through the EIR amortisation process.
The EIR amortisation is included in finance costs in the income statement.

Andrew Southam d Company accounting policies Chief Financial Officer Basis of preparation The KAZ Minerals PLC parent company balance sheet, statement of cash flows, statement of changes in equity and related notes have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial information has been prepared on a historical cost basis.
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis see note 2 a.
The functional currency of the Company and the presentational currency adopted is US dollars.
Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements refer to notes 2 and 35 except for the additional accounting policy relating to non-current investments set out below.
There were no changes to the accounting policies during the year.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs as adopted by the EU requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, following implementation of these standards, actual results may differ from those estimates.
Non-current investments Non-current investments are held at cost.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Any positive change in the amount or timing of estimated future cash flows or in the discount rate such that fair value of the Companys investments increases, consideration will be given to whether previously recognised impairments should be reversed.
