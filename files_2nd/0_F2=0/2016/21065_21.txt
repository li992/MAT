Excluding these effects, the reported tax rate for the year was 17%.
The cash tax paid for the year was $412m which was 12% of profit before tax.
Cash tax was lower in 2016 due to refunds arising in relation to agreement of prior period tax liabilities and audit settlements.
Taxation has been provided at current rates on the profits earned for the periods covered by the Group Financial Statements.
The 2016 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to net reductions in provisions for tax contingencies totalling $67m and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2015 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to a $186m tax benefit following agreement of US federal tax liabilities of open years to 2008, netreductions in provisions for tax contingencies totalling $259m and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.

To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided for.
No deferred tax has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as these are considered permanently employed in the business of these companies.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and or UK taxation after allowing for double tax relief if distributed as dividends.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately $6,884m at 31December 2016 2015:$6,957m: 2014:$6,128m.
Factors affecting future tax charges As a group with worldwide operations, AstraZeneca is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms.
In 2016, the UK Government enacted legislation to reduce the main rate of UK Statutory Corporation Tax to 17% by 2020.
Details of material tax exposures and items currently under audit and negotiation are set out in Note28.

6 Segment information AstraZeneca is engaged in a single business activity of biopharmaceuticals and the Group does not have multiple operating segments.
AstraZenecas biopharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, marketed and sold.
All of these functional activities take place and are managed globally on a highly integrated basis.
These individual functional areas are not managed separately.
The SET, established and chaired by the CEO, is the vehicle through which he exercises the authority delegated to him from the Board for the management, development and performance of our business.
It is considered that the SET is AstraZenecas chief operating decision making body as defined by IFRS8 Operating Segments.
The operation of the SET is principally driven by the management of the commercial operations, R&D, and manufacturing and supply.
In addition to the CEO, CFO, the General Counsel and the Chief Compliance Officer, the SET comprises 10 Executive Vice-Presidents representing IMED, MedImmune, Global Medicines Development, North America, Europe, International East, International West, GPPS, Operations & Information Technology, and Human Resources.
All significant operating decisions are taken by the SET.
While members of the SET have responsibility for implementation of decisions in their respective areas, operating decision making is at SET level as a whole.
Where necessary, these are implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the Group-wide impact of a new decision.
For example, product launch decisions would be initially considered by the SET and, on approval, passed to an appropriate sub-team for implementation.
Theimpacts of being able to develop, produce, deliver and commercialise a wide range of pharmaceutical products drive the SET decision makingprocess.
152 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2016 Financial Statements 6 Segment information continued In assessing performance, the SET reviews financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in the form of, and onthe same basis as, the Groups IFRS Financial Statements.
The high upfront cost of discovering and developing new products coupled with the relatively insignificant and stable unit cost of production means that there is not the clear link that exists in many manufacturing businesses between the revenue generated on an individual product sale and the associated cost and hence margin generated on a product.
Consequently, the profitability of individual drugs or classes of drugs is not considered a key measure of performance for the business and is not monitored by the SET.
Resources are allocated on a Group-wide basis according to need.
In particular, capital expenditure, in-licensing, and R&D resources are allocated between activities on merit, based on overall therapeutic considerations and strategy under the aegis of the Groups Early Stage Product Committees and a single Late Stage Product Committee.
Geographic areas The following tables show information by geographic area and, for Total Revenue and property, plant and equipment, material countries.
The figures show the Total Revenue, operating profit and profit before tax made by companies located in that area country, together with segment assets, segment assets acquired, net operating assets, and property, plant and equipment owned by the same companies: export sales and the related profit are included in the area country where the legal entity resides and from which those sales were made.

The recoverable amount is based on value in use using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the Groups pre-tax cash flows over 10 years which is considered by the Board as a reasonable period given the long development and life-cycle of a medicine.
The projections include assumptions about product launches, competition from rival products and pricing policy as well as the possibility of generics entering the market.
In setting these assumptions we consider our past experience, external sources of information including information on expected increases and ageing of the populations in our established markets and the expanding patient population in newer markets, our knowledge ofcompetitor activity and our assessment of future changes in the pharmaceutical industry.
The 10-year period is covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
Given that internal budgets and forecasts are prepared for all projections, no general growth rates are used to extrapolate internal budgets and forecasts for the purposes of determining value in use.
No terminal value is included as these cash flows are more than sufficient to establish that an impairment does not exist.
The methods used to determine recoverable amounts have remained consistent with the prior year.
In arriving at value in use, we disaggregate our projected pre-tax cash flows into groups reflecting similar risks and tax effects.
For each group of cash flows we use an appropriate discount rate reflecting those risks and tax effects.
In arriving at the appropriate discount rate for each group of cash flows, we adjust AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.0% for 2016, 2015 and 2014 to reflect the impact ofrisks relevant to that group of assets, the time value of money and tax effects.
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 10% 2015:10%: 2014:10%.
As a further check, we compare our market capitalisation to the book value of our net assets and this indicates significant surplus at 31December 2016 and 31December 2015 and 31December 2014.
No goodwill impairment was identified.
The Group has also performed sensitivity analysis calculations on the projections used and discount rate applied.
The Directors have concluded that, given the significant headroom that exists, and the results of the sensitivity analysis performed, there is no significant risk that reasonable changes in any key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its value in use.

The write downs in value of intangible assets, other than those arising from termination of R&D activities, were determined based on value in use calculations using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the products expected post-tax cash flows over aperiod reflecting the patent-protected lives of the individual products.
The full period of projections is covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
In arriving at the appropriate discount rate to use for each product, we adjust AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.0% for 2016, 2015 and 2014 to reflect the impact of risks and tax effects specific to the individual products.
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 13% 2015:13%: 2014:13%.
By their nature, the value in use calculations are sensitive to the underlying methods, assumptions and estimates.
Consistent with prior years, as part of the impairment review process, management has identified that reasonably possible changes in certain key assumptions may cause the carrying amount of the intangible assets to exceed the recoverable amount.
At 31December 2016, the Group held intangible assets for products in development of $14,261m 2015:$8,732m: 2014:$6,598m, for which the most sensitive assumption is the probability of technical success, and intangible assets for launched products of $12,991m 2015:$13,504m: 2014:$13,915m, for which the most sensitive assumptions are the projected market share of the therapeutic area and expected pricing.
In particular, where a trial is unsuccessful and there is no alternative use for the development asset, this will result in a full impairment.
As detailed in Note25, we have recognised significant intangible assets for late stage development programmes and launched products on business combinations at their fair value at acquisition.
Management has identified that the impairment review calculations on these assets, in particular those from Acerta Pharma, ZS Pharma, BMSs share of the Global Diabetes Alliance and Almiralls respiratory franchise, are especially sensitive to the key assumptions noted above.
Given their nature, impairment adjustments triggered by future events that have yet to occur may be material.
In addition, there is a significant risk that impairments recognised in any one period may be subject to material adjustments in future periods.

On 29 March 2016, Entasis closed a Series B financing, raising $25m from four third-party investors.
Under the funding agreement, a new board of directors was appointed, and a voting rights agreement was put in place committing to reduce AstraZenecas voting interest to approximately 49%.
Since AstraZeneca no longer has overall control of Entasis, it is now treated as an associate rather than a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group.
The results of Entasis were deconsolidated from the Group on 29 March, with an investment in associate of $24m recognised.
There was no gain or loss recognised on deconsolidation.
On 1December 2015, AstraZeneca entered into a joint venture agreement with Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics Co. Ltd. to develop a biosimilar using the combined capabilities of the two parties.
The agreement resulted in the formation of a joint venture entity based in the UK, Centus Biotherapeutics Limited.
AstraZeneca contributed $45m in cash to the joint venture entity and has a 50% interest in the joint venture.
An additional contribution of $10m was made in 2016.
On 30 April 2014, AstraZeneca entered into a joint venture agreement with Samsung Biologics Co. Ltd. to develop a biosimilar using the combined capabilities of the two parties.
The agreement resulted in the formation of a joint venture entity based in the UK, Archigen Biotech Limited, with a branch in South Korea.
AstraZeneca contributed $70m in cash to the joint venture entity and has a 50% interest in the joint venture.
An additional contribution of $30m was made in 2016.

Equity securities and bonds available for sale are held at fair value.
The fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices.
For unlisted investments whose fair value cannot be reliably measured, cost is considered to approximate to fair value.
Fixed deposits are held at amortised cost with carrying value being areasonable approximation of fair value given their short-term nature.
None of the financial assets or liabilities have been reclassified in the year.
Fair value hierarchy The table below analyses equity securities and bonds available for sale, contained within other investments and carried at fair value, by valuation method.
Thedifferent levels have been defined as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ieasprices or indirectly ie derived from prices.

None of the derivatives have been reclassified in the year.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques to discount future contractual cash flows based on rates at current year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options are estimated by cash flow accounting models using appropriate yield curves based on market forward foreign exchange rates at the year end.
The majority of forward foreign exchange contracts for existing transactions had maturities of less than one month from year end.
The interest rates used to discount future cash flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at the reporting date, and were as follows.

The resulting modified royalty structure, which includes fixed minimum and maximum payments in years until 2020, has resulted in the Group recognising liabilities, and corresponding prepayments, for the discounted value of total minimum payments.
The current portion of the prepayment is $116m 2015:$260m: 2014:$323m and is reported in amounts due within one year see Note15.

The carrying value of loans designated at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value: this falls within the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note11.
For loans designated in a fair value hedge relationship, carrying value is initially measured at fair value and remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting date.
All other loans are held at amortised cost.
Fair values, as disclosed in the table above, are all determined using the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note11, with the exception of overdrafts and finance leases, where fair value approximates to carrying values.
A loss of $8m was made during the year on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss, due to decreased credit risk.
Again of $40m has been made on these bonds since designation due to increased credit risk.
Changes in credit risk had no material effect on any other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Group Financial Statements.

20 Post-retirement benefits Pensions Background The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group.
Many of these plans are defined contribution, where AstraZenecas contribution and resulting charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
However, several plans, mainly in the UK, the US and Sweden, are defined benefit, where benefits are based on employees length of service and linked to their salary.
The major defined benefit plans, apart from the collectively bargained Swedish plan which is still open to employees born before 1979, have been closed to new entrants since 2000.
During 2010, following consultation with its UK employees representatives, AstraZeneca introduced a freeze on pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels for defined benefit members of the UK Pension Fund.
The major defined benefit plans are funded through separate,  assets.
The cash funding of the plans, which may from time totime involve special payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets together with future contributions should be sufficient to meet future obligations.
The funding is monitored rigorously by AstraZeneca and appropriate fiduciaries including with reference to AstraZenecas credit rating, market capitalisation, cash flows and the solvency and maturity of the relevant pension scheme.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2016 165 Financial Statements 20 Post-retirement benefits continued Financing principles 92% of the Companys defined benefit obligations at 31December 2016 are in schemes within the UK, the US and Sweden.
In these countries, the pension obligations are funded with reference to the following financing principles: The Company has a fundamental belief in funding the benefits it promises to employees.
The Company considers its pension arrangements in the context of its broader capital structure.
In general, it does not believe in committing excessive capital for funding while it has better uses of capital within the business nor does it wish to generate surpluses.
The pension funds are not part of the Companys core business.
The Company believes in taking some measured and rewarded risks with the investments underlying the funding, subject to a long-term plan to reduce those risks when opportunities arise.
The Company recognises that deciding to hold certain investments may cause volatility in the funding position.
The Company would not wish to amend its contribution level for relatively small deviations from its preferred funding level, because it is expected that there will be short-term volatility, but it is prepared to react appropriately to more significant deviations.
The Company proactively engages with local Fiduciary Bodies to provide oversight and input in relation to funding and investment strategy and to help facilitate liability management exercises appropriate to each pension plan.
The Company considers the use of alternative methods of providing security that do not require immediate cash funding but help mitigate exposure of the pension arrangement to the credit risk of the Company.
These principles are appropriate to AstraZenecas business at the present date: should circumstances change they may require review.
AstraZeneca has developed a long-term funding framework to implement these principles, which targets full funding on a low risk funding measure over the long term, as the pension funds mature.
This framework determines the cash contributions payable to the pension funds, but does not affect the IAS 19 liabilities.
UK With regard to the Companys UK defined benefit pension fund, the above principles are modified in light of the UK regulatory requirements summarised below and resulting discussions with the Pension Fund Trustee.
Role of Trustees UK The UK Pension Fund is governed and administered by a corporate Trustee which is legally separate from the Company.
The Trustee Directors are comprised of representatives appointed by both the employer and employees, and include an independent professional Trustee Director.
The Trustee Directors are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible in particular for the asset investment policy and the day-to-day administration of the benefits.
They are also responsible for jointly agreeing with the employer the level of contributions due to the UK Pension Fund see below.
Funding requirements UK UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently ie to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits.
On a triennial basis, the Trustee and the Company must agree the contributions required if any to ensure the Fund is fully funded over time on a suitable prudent measure.
The last full actuarial valuation of the AstraZeneca Pension Fund was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 31 March 2013.
An updated actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2016 is in the process of being finalised with discussions ongoing between the Trustee and the Company.
A lump sum contribution of 51m $72m was made to help narrow the deficit in March 2016, with a further 51m contribution due before 31March2017.
The Company entered into a long-term funding agreement with the Trustee on 21October 2016.
Under this agreement, the Company will grant a charge in favour of the Trustee over the new Cambridge Biomedical Campus, which would crystallise only in the event of the Companys insolvency.
This charge will provide security in respect of future UK Pension Fund contributions and replaces a charge over assets in a ring-fenced custodial account held by AstraZeneca with HSBC.
Since the Trustees charge over this custodial account has been released, these assets are now available for the Company to use in the business.
Under the funding assumptions used to set the statutory funding target, the key assumptions as at 31 March 2013 were as follows: long-term UK price inflation set at 3.55% per annum, salary increases at 0% per annum as a result of pensionable pay levels being frozen in 2010, pension increases at 3.2% per annum and investment returns at 4.86% per annum.
The resulting valuation of the Funds liabilities on that basis were 4,887m $5,997m compared to a market value of assets at 31 March 2013 of 4,394m $5,392m.
Under the governing documentation of the UK Pension Fund, any future surplus in the Fund would be returnable to AstraZeneca by refund assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the Fund.
As such, there are no adjustments required in respect of IFRIC14 IAS19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
Liability Management Exercises UK During 2016, the Company conducted a Pensions Increase Exchange PIE exercise in two stages.
This exercise offers certain pensioner members the option of taking a higher amount of pension right away, in exchange for giving up any potential future inflation linked increases on all, or part of their pension.
Stage 2 commenced in 2016 and is due to complete by the end of June 2017.
166 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2016 Financial Statements 20 Post-retirement benefits continued Regulation UK The UK pensions market is regulated by the Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website, www.
Rest of Group The IAS19 positions for the US and Sweden as at 31December 2016 are shown below.
These plans account for 29% of the Groups defined benefit obligations.
The US and Sweden pension funds are governed by fiduciary bodies with responsibility for the investment policies of those funds.
These plans are funded in line with the Companys financing principles and contributions are paid as prescribed by the long-term funding framework.
The US defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31December 2016, when plan obligations were $1,795m and plan assets were $1,563m.
This includes obligations in respect of the non-qualified plan which is largely unfunded.
The Swedish defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31December 2016, when plan obligations were estimated to amount to $1,521m and plan assets were $1,009m.
On current bases, it is expected that contributions excluding those in respect of past service deficit contributions during the year ending 31December 2017 for the three main countries will be approximately $55m.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions In the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, AstraZenecas employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life assurance benefits for retired employees.
As at 31December 2016, some 3,283 retired employees and covered dependants currently benefit from these provisions and some 10,381 current employees will be eligible on their retirement.
AstraZeneca accrues for the present value of such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee.
In practice, these benefits will be funded with reference to the financing principles.
The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2016 was $17m 2015:$23m: 2014:$20m.
Plan assets were $285m and plan obligations were $309m at 31December 2016.
These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits under IAS19.
Financial assumptions Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations under IAS 19 of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31December 2016.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the schemes, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
These assumptions were as follows: 2016 2015 UK Rest of Group UK Rest of Group Inflation assumption 3.2% 2.1% 3.0% 2.1% 1 1 Rate of increase in salaries 3.1% 3.0% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.0% 0.9% 3.0% 0.8% Discount rate 2.7% 3.3% 3.8% 3.8% 1 3HQVLRQDEOH SD IUR]HQ DWXQH OHYHOV IROORZLQJ 8.
IXQG FKDQJHV Discount rate and methodology changes Over 2016, the Companys discount rates were based on yields on long-term AA-rated fixed income instruments, using a single discount rate for each pension plan to value the defined benefit obligations, service cost and interest cost.
The discount rate was based on the duration of cash flows underlying the defined benefit obligations.
From 2017, for the largest plans, the Company will move to a multiple discount rate approach.
This will result in separate discount rates for defined benefit obligations, service cost and interest cost.
This change had no effect on the 2016 expense, and will not affect the future measurement of the defined benefit obligations, but will impact the service cost and interest cost in future years.
Demographic assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables.
These are compared to actual AstraZeneca experience and adjusted where sufficient data is available.
Additional allowance for future improvements in life expectancy is included for all major schemes where there is credible data to support this continuing trend.
The table below illustrates life expectancy assumptions at age 65 for male members retiring in 2016 and members expected to retire in 2036 2015:2015 and 2035 respectively.

A one-year increase in life expectancy will result in a $200m increase in pension fund assets.
Other risks There are a number of other risks of running the UK Pension Fund including operational risks such as paying out the wrong benefits and legislative risks such as the government increasing the burden on pension funds through new legislation.
These are mitigated in so far as possible via the governance structure in place which oversees and administers the pension funds.

The present value of the schemes obligations is derived from cash flow projections over long periods and is therefore inherently uncertain.

2 Of the $300m increase, $200m is covered by the longevity swap.
3 Of the $292m decrease, $196m is covered by the longevity swap.
The sensitivity to the financial assumptions shown above has been estimated taking into account the approximate duration of the liabilities and the overall profile of the plan membership.
The sensitivity to the life expectancy assumption has been estimated based on the distribution of the plan cash flows.

172 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2016 Financial Statements 24 Non-controlling interests Following the acquisition of a majority stake in Acerta Pharma on 2 February 2016, the Group Financial Statements at 31 December 2016 reflect equity of $1,808m and total comprehensive income of $95m attributable to the non-controlling interests, held by other parties, of Acerta Pharma B. V. and its subsidiaries.
Thefollowing summarised financial information, for Acerta Pharma B. V. and its subsidiaries, is presented on a stand-alone basis since the acquisition date, and before the impact of Group-related adjustments: 2016 $m Total Revenue Loss after tax 212 Other comprehensive income Total comprehensive income 212 2016 $m Non-current assets 73 Current assets 79 Total assets 152 Current liabilities 171 Total liabilities 171 Net liabilities 19 2016 $m Net cash outflow from operating activities 223 Net cash inflow from investing activities 139 Decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the year 84 The non-controlling interest in Acerta Pharma is subject to a put option, exercisable by the minority shareholders at certain points in the future, not earlier than the commercial launch of acalabrutinib.
This put option gives rise to a liability which is recorded at the present value of the expected redemption amount, calculated using a simulation model based on forecast revenue and earnings of Acerta Pharma, and is recorded within Non-current other payables see Note18.
The corresponding debit has been recorded in retained earnings.
25 Acquisitions of business operations 2016 Acquisitions Acerta Pharma On 2 February 2016, AstraZeneca completed an agreement to invest in a majority equity stake in Acerta Pharma, a privately-owned biopharmaceutical company based in the Netherlands and US.
The transaction provides AstraZeneca with a potential best-in-class irreversible oral Brutons tyrosine kinase BTK inhibitor, acalabrutinib ACP-196, currently in Phase III development for B-cell blood cancers and in Phase I II clinical trials in multiple solid tumours.
Acerta Pharma has approximately 150 employees.
Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca has acquired 55% of the issued share capital of Acerta Pharma for an upfront payment of $2.5bn.
A further payment of $1.5bn will be paid either on receipt of the first regulatory approval for acalabrutinib for any indication in the US, or the end of 2018, depending on which is first.
The agreement also includes options which, if exercised, provide the opportunity for Acerta Pharmas shareholders to sell, and AstraZeneca to buy, the remaining 45% of shares in Acerta Pharma.
The options can be exercised at various points in time, conditional on the first approval of acalabrutinib in both the US and Europe and when the extent of the commercial opportunity has been fully established, at a price of approximately $3bn net of certain costs and payments incurred by AstraZeneca and net of agreed future adjusting items, using a pre-agreed pricing mechanism.
The acquiring entity within the Group was a Swedish krona functional currency subsidiary.
Foreign currency risk arises from the retranslation of the US dollar denominated liabilities arising from the transaction.
To manage this foreign currency risk these liabilities have been designated as the hedge instrument in a net investment hedge of the Groups underlying US dollar net investments.
Exchange differences on the retranslation of the contingent consideration liability are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to profit.
AstraZenecas 55% holding is a controlling interest and Acerta Pharmas combination of intangible product rights with an established workforce and their operating processes requires that the transaction is accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3.
Goodwill is principally attributable to the value of the specialist know-how inherent in the acquired workforce and the accounting for deferred taxes.
Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acerta Pharmas results have been consolidated into the Groups results from 2 February 2016.
From the period from acquisition to 31December 2016, Acerta Pharma had no revenues and its loss after tax was $212m.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred 1January 2016, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2016 would have been unchanged and the profit after tax would have been $3,367m.
This pro forma information does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on1January 2016 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2016 173 Financial Statements 25 Acquisitions of business operations continued The fair values assigned to the Acerta Pharma business combination completed in 2016 were: Fair value $m Non-current assets Intangible assets Note 9 7,307 Current assets 253 Current liabilities 90 Non-current liabilities Deferred tax liabilities 1,777 Total net assets acquired 5,693 Non-controlling interests 1,903 Goodwill Note 8 19 Fair value of total consideration 3,809 Less: fair value of deferred consideration 1,332 Total upfront consideration 2,477 Less: cash and cash equivalents acquired 94 Net cash outflow 2,383 Acquisition costs were immaterial.
2015 Acquisitions ZS Pharma On 17 December 2015, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of ZS Pharma, a biopharmaceutical company based in San Mateo, California.
ZSPharma uses its proprietary ion-trap technology to develop novel treatments for hyperkalaemia, a serious condition of elevated potassium in thebloodstream, typically associated with chronic kidney disease CKD and chronic heart failure CHF.
The acquisition gives AstraZeneca access to the potassium-binding compound ZS-9, a potential best-in-class treatment for hyperkalaemia.
ZS Pharma represents a strong fit with AstraZenecas pipeline and portfolio in Cardiovascular & Metabolic Disease, one of the Companys three main therapy areas.
AstraZenecas strategy focuses on reducing morbidity, mortality and organ damage by addressing multiple risk factors across cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic kidney disease.
ZS-9 complements the Companys increasing focus on CKD and CHF, including the investigational medicine roxadustat, which is currently in Phase III development for patients with anaemia associated with CKD, as well as its leading Diabetes portfolio.
Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca acquired 100% of the share capital of ZS Pharma for $90 per share in an all-cash transaction, orapproximately $2.7bn in aggregate transaction value.
ZS Pharma has around 200 employees across three sites in California, Texas and Colorado.
The combination of intangible product rights with anestablished workforce and their associated operating processes, principally those related to research and development and manufacturing, requires that the transaction is accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3.
Goodwill is principally attributable to the commercial synergies AstraZeneca expects to be able to realise upon launch of ZS-9, the value of the specialist know-how inherent in the acquired workforce and the accounting for deferred taxes.
Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for taxpurposes.
ZS Pharmas results have been consolidated into the Groups results from 17 December 2015.
From the period from acquisition to 31December 2015, ZS Pharmas revenues and loss were immaterial.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred 1January 2015, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2015 would have been unchanged and the profit after tax would have been $2,702m.
This pro forma information does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1January 2015 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.
Given the proximity of the completion of the transaction to the date the 2015 Financial Statements were approved, the finalisation of the accounting entries for this transaction was not complete.
Our provisional assessment of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired, as detailed in the 2015 Financial Statements, was revised during 2016 as a result of new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition that impact the value of deferred tax.
This has resulted in a reduction to both deferred tax liabilities and goodwill of $68m.
174 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2016 Financial Statements 25 Acquisitions of business operations continued The final fair values assigned to the ZS Pharma business combination are detailed below: Fair value $m Non-current assets Intangible assets Note 9 3,162 Property, plant and equipment Note 7 21 3,183 Current assets 169 Current liabilities 50 Non-current liabilities Deferred tax liabilities 977 Other liabilities 13 990 Total net assets acquired 2,312 Goodwill Note 8 388 Total upfront consideration 2,700 Less: cash and cash equivalents acquired 73 Less: upfront consideration settled in January 2016 181 Net cash outflow 2,446 Acquisition costs were immaterial.
2014 Acquisitions BMSs share of Global Diabetes Alliance Assets On 1February 2014, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of BMSs interests in the companies diabetes alliance.
The acquisition provided AstraZeneca with 100% ownership of the intellectual property and global rights for the development, manufacture and commercialisation of the diabetes business, including Onglyza saxagliptin, Kombiglyze XR saxagliptin and metformin HCl extended release, Komboglyze saxagliptin and metformin HCl, Farxiga dapagliflozin, marketed as Forxiga outside the US, Byetta exenatide, Bydureon exenatide extended release for injectable suspension, Myalept metreleptin and Symlin pramlintide acetate.
The transaction consolidated worldwide ownership of the diabetes business within AstraZeneca, leveraging its primary and specialty care capabilities and its geographical reach, especially in emerging markets.
The transaction included the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, LLC, and the asset purchase of the additional intellectual property and global rights not already owned by AstraZeneca, for the development, manufacture and commercialisation of Onglyza, Kombiglyze XR, Komboglyze and Farxiga, including associated BMS employees.
This combination of intangible product rights and manufacturing assets with an established workforce and their associated operating processes, principally those related to the global manufacturing and selling and marketing operations, required that the acquisition be accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS3.
Upfront consideration for the acquisition of $2.7bn was paid on 1February 2014, with further payments of up to $1.4bn being payable for future regulatory, launch and sales-related milestones as well as various sales-related royalty payments up until 2025.
The amount of royalties payable under the agreement is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, given the direct link to future sales and the range of outcomes cannot be reliably estimated.
The maximum amount payable in each year is with reference to net sales.
AstraZeneca also agreed to make payments up to $225m when certain additional assets are transferred.
Contingent consideration was fair valued using decision-tree analysis, with key inputs including the probability of success, consideration of potential delays and the expected levels of future revenues.
In accordance with IFRS3, the fair value of contingent consideration, including future royalties, was recognised immediately as a liability.
Foreign currency risk arises from the retranslation of the US dollar denominated contingent consideration.
To manage this foreign currency risk the contingent consideration liability has been designated as the hedge instrument in a net investment hedge of the Groups underlying US dollar net investments.
In addition to the acquired interests, AstraZeneca entered into certain agreements with BMS to maintain the manufacturing and supply chain of thefull portfolio of diabetes products and to deliver specified clinical trials with an agreed number of R&D and manufacturing employees dedicated to diabetes remaining with BMS to progress the diabetes portfolio and support the transition for these areas.
Payments by AstraZeneca to BMS inrelation to these arrangements are expensed as incurred.
No amounts were recognised in the initial acquisition accounting in relation to these arrangements but were separated, at fair value, from the business combination accounting.
The terms of the agreement partially reflected settlement of the launch and sales-related milestones under the pre-existing Onglyza and Farxiga collaboration agreements, which were terminated in relation to the acquisition.
The expected value of those pre-existing milestones was $0.3bn and was recognised as a separate component of consideration and excluded from the business combination accounting.
Subsequently, these separate intangible assets have been recognised.
Goodwill of $1,530m arising on the transaction is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified.
Most significant among these are the synergies AstraZeneca expects to be able to generate through more efficient manufacturing processes and the incremental value accessible through strategic and operational independence upon taking full control of the alliance.
Goodwill of $1.5bn is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2016 175 Financial Statements 25 Acquisitions of business operations continued The fair value of receivables acquired as part of the acquisition approximated the gross contractual amounts receivable.
There were no significant amounts which were not expected to be collected.
The results from the additional acquired interests in the diabetes alliance were consolidated into the Groups results from 1February 2014, which added revenue of $895m in the period to 31December 2014.
Due to the highly integrated nature of the diabetes alliance, and the fact that it is not operated through a separate legal entity, the incremental direct costs associated with the additional acquired interest are not separately identifiable and it is impracticable therefore to disclose the profit or loss recognised in the period since acquisition.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred 1January 2014, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2014 would have been $26,174m.
As detailed above, it is impracticable to disclose a pro forma profit after tax.
This pro forma information does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1January 2014 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.
Almirall On 31 October 2014, the Group completed the agreement with Almirall to transfer the rights to Almiralls respiratory franchise to AstraZeneca.
The transaction provided AstraZeneca with 100% of the rights for the development and commercialisation of Almiralls existing proprietary respiratory business, including rights to revenues from Almiralls existing collaborations, as well as its pipeline of investigational novel therapies.
The franchise includes Eklira aclidinium : Duaklir Genuair, the combination of aclidinium with formoterol which had been filed for registration in the EU and developed in the US EU approval received in November 2014 : LAS100977 abediterol, a once-daily long-acting betaagonist LABA in Phase II: an M3 2 antagonist betaagonist MABA platform in pre-clinical development LAS191351, LAS194871 and Phase I LAS190792 : and multiple pre-clinical 2 programmes.
Almirall Sofotec, an Almirall subsidiary focused on the development of innovative proprietary devices, also transferred to AstraZeneca.
In addition, Almirall employees dedicated to the respiratory business, including Almirall Sofotec employees, transferred to AstraZeneca.
Upfront consideration for the acquisition of $878m was paid in November 2014, with further payments of up to $1.22bn being payable for future development, launch, and sales-related milestones.
AstraZeneca also agreed to make various sales-related royalty payments.
Contingent consideration was fair valued using decisiontree analysis, with key inputs including the probability of success, consideration of potential delays and the expected levels of future revenues.
The acquiring entity within the Group was a pounds sterling functional currency subsidiary.
Foreign currency risk arises from the retranslation of the contingent consideration.
To manage this foreign currency risk the contingent consideration liability has been designated as the hedge instrument in a net investment hedge.
Almiralls pipeline of novel respiratory assets and its device capabilities further strengthen AstraZenecas Respiratory portfolio, which includes Symbicort and Pulmicort, as well as the investigational medicines in development.
The addition of aclidinium and the combination of aclidinium withformoterol, both in proprietary Genuair device, allows AstraZeneca to offer patients a choice between dry powder inhaler and metered-dose inhaler devices across a range of molecules and combinations.
The combination of intangible product rights with an established workforce and their associated operating processes, principally those related to the selling and marketing operations, requires that the transaction is accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS3.
Goodwill of $311m is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified.
Most significant among these is the premium attributable to the significant competitive advantage associated with AstraZenecas complementary portfolio and that attributable to a highly skilled workforce.
Goodwill of $0.3bn is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Almiralls respiratory franchise results were consolidated into the Groups results from 31 October 2014.
For the period from acquisition to 31December 2014, Almiralls respiratory franchise revenues were $13m.
Due to the highly integrated nature of the respiratory franchise, and the fact that it is not operated through a separate legal entity, the incremental direct costs associated with the acquired interest are not separately identifiable and it is impracticable therefore to disclose the profit or loss recognised in the period since acquisition.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred 1January 2014, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2014 would have been $26,198m.
Definiens On 25 November 2014, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Definiens Group, a privately-held German company focused on imaging and data analysis technology, known as Tissue Phenomics, which dramatically improves the identification of biomarkers in tumour tissue.
Definiens technology provides detailed cell-by-cell readouts from target structures on tissue slides and allows the correlation of this information with data derived from other sources, generating new knowledge and supporting better decisions in research, diagnostics and therapy.
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Definiens shares for an upfront consideration of $150m and contingent consideration of up to $150m based on reaching three predetermined development milestones.
Contingent consideration was fair valued using decision-tree analysis, with key inputs including the probability of success and consideration of potential delays.
176 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2016 Financial Statements 25 Acquisitions of business operations continued The acquiring entity within the Group was a pounds sterling functional currency subsidiary.
Definiens results were consolidated into the Groups results from 25 November 2014.
For the period from acquisition to 31December 2014, Definiens revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Groups revenues, and its loss after tax was immaterial.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred 1January 2014, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2014 would have been unchanged and the change in profit after tax would have been immaterial.

26 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, finance leases, loans, current and non-current investments, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from itsoperations.
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit.
Each of these is managed in accordance with Board-approved policies.
These policies are set out below.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and swaps, currency options, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks.
The Group may designate certain financial instruments as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Key controls applied to transactions in derivative financial instruments are: to use only instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue all financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options only to offset previously purchased options or as part of a risk management strategy.
The Group is not a net seller of options, and does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity Note22, debt Note17 and cash Note16.
For the foreseeable future, theBoard will maintain a capital structure that supports the Groups strategic objectives through: managing funding and liquidity risk optimising shareholder return maintaining a strong, investment-grade credit rating.
The Group utilises factoring arrangements for selected trade receivables.
These factoring arrangements qualify for full derecognition of the associated trade receivables under IAS 39.
Funding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with policies described below.
The Boards distribution policy comprises a regular cash dividend and, subject to business needs, a share repurchase component.
The Board regularly reviews its shareholders return strategy, and in 2012 decided to suspend share repurchases in order to retain strategic flexibility.
The Groups net debt position loans and borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivative financial instruments has increased from a net debt position of $7,762m at the beginning of the year to a net debt position of $10,657m at 31December 2016, primarily as a result of increased outflows from investing activities, including acquisitions.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2016 177 Financial Statements 26 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Liquidity risk The Board reviews the Groups ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the planning process and on an ad hoc basis.
The Board considers short-term requirements against available sources of funding, taking into account forecast cash flows.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining access to a number of sources of funding which are sufficient to meet anticipated funding requirements.
Specifically, the Group uses US commercial paper, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term liquidity by raising funds through the capital markets.
The Group is assigned short-term credit ratings of P-2 by Moodys and A-2 by Standard and Poors.
The Groups long-term credit rating is A3 stable outlook by Moodys and Astable outlook by Standard and Poors.
In addition to cash and cash equivalents of $5,018m, fixed deposits of $37m, less overdrafts of $94m at 31December 2016, the Group has committed bank facilities of $3bn available to manage liquidity.
At 31December 2016, the Group has issued $3,494m under a Euro Medium Term Note programme and $12,763m under a SEC-registered programme.
The Group regularly monitors the credit standing of the banking group and currently does not anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed facilities should this be necessary.
The committed facilities of $3bn mature inApril 2021 and were undrawn at 31December 2016.
It is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity profile could occur significantly earlier or at significantly different amounts, with the exception of $5,457m of contingent consideration and $1,901m arising from the put option over the non-controlling interest in Acerta Pharma, both held within other payables see Note18.
Market risk Interest rate risk The Group maintains a mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The portion of fixed rate debt was approved by the Board and any variation requires Board approval.
A significant portion of the Groups long-term debt is held at fixed rates of interest.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage this mix.
At 31December 2016, the Group held interest rate swaps with a notional value of $1.6bn, converting the 7% guaranteed debentures payable in 2023 to floating rates, partially converting the 5.9% callable bond maturing in 2017 to floating rates and partially converting the 1.75% callable bond maturing in 2018 to floating rates.
No new interest rate swaps were entered into during 2016.
At 31December 2016, swaps with a notional value of $1.35bn were designated in fair value hedge relationships and swaps with a notional value of $0.29bn related to debt designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Designated hedges are expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on profit is not expected to be material.
The accounting treatment for fair value hedges and debt designated as fair value through profit or loss is disclosed in the Group Accounting Policies section from page142.
The majority of surplus cash is currently invested in US dollar liquidity funds earning floating rates of interest.
The interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments is set out below.
In the case of current and non-current financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps which convert the debt to floating rate.
Foreign currency risk The US dollar is the Groups most significant currency.
As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures are managed against US dollars accordingly.
Translational Approximately 66% of Group external sales in 2016 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a significant proportion of manufacturing, and research and development costs were denominated in pounds sterling and Swedish krona.
Surplus cash generated by business units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, US dollars.
As a result, operating profit and total cash flow in US dollars will be affected by movements in exchange rates.
This currency exposure is managed centrally, based on forecast cash flows.
The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated significantly by the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar.
Monitoring of currency exposures and correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval.
As at 31December 2016, 2.5% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in pounds sterling and 18.3% were denominated in euros.
Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the Group applies net investment hedging.
Exchange differences on the retranslation of debt designated as net investment hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
In 2016, the Group issued 2.2bn of bonds in the euro debt capital markets with maturities of 5, 8 and 12 years.
The Group entered into cross-currency swaps to convert the proceeds into fixed US dollar debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.69% and maturities equal to the bonds.
These instruments were designated in a cash flow hedge.
To the extent that the hedge is effective, fair value movements on the revaluation of cross-currency swaps designated in a cash flow hedge are taken to other comprehensive income.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2016 179 Financial Statements 26 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued In 2016, the Group entered into a cross-currency swap to convert an additional $69m into fixed Chinese renminbi debt maturing in 2026.
This instrument was designated in a net investment hedge against the foreign currency risk of the Groups renminbi net assets.
Fair value movements onthe revaluation of the cross-currency swaps are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Foreign currency risk arises when the Group has intercompany funding and investments in certain subsidiaries operating in countries with exchange controls.
The most significant risk in this respect is Venezuela, where the Group has approximately $104m equivalent of local currency cash, on which there have been delays in obtaining approval for remittance outside the country.
The official exchange rate for essential goods and services is VEF 10 $ the DIPRO rate as published by CENCOEX the National Foreign Trade Center.
Alternative exchange rates include the SIMADI Sistema Marginal fide Divisas rate, which was introduced in 2015.
For 2016, the Group used the DIPRO rate for the consolidation of the financial statements of the Venezuelan subsidiaries.
The Group believes that this rate represents the most appropriate rate for consolidation as it reflects their best expectation of the rate at which profits will be remitted.
The Group has restructured $153m of intercompany trading balances in order to manage the FX retranslation risk should the DIPRO rate increase over the next 12 months.
Had the Group applied the SIMADI rate for the consolidation of the financial statements of the Venezuelan subsidiaries, the Group would be exposed to a potential income statement devaluation loss of $15m on its total intercompany balances and the local currency cash would be reduced to $2m on consolidation.
Transactional One hundred percent of the Groups major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts against individual Group companies reporting currency.
In addition, the Groups external dividend, which is paid principally in pounds sterling and Swedish krona, is fully hedged from announcement to payment date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to profit.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market rates and prices.
The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period.
Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date.
For long-term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31December 2016, with all other variables held constant.
Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio as at 31December 2016, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $26m in interest expense being incurred per year.
The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31December 2016, with all other variables held constant.
The 10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.
Each incremental 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have approximately the same effect as the initial 10% detailed in the table below and each 1% change in interest rates would have approximately the same effect as the 1% detailed in the table below.

180 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2016 Financial Statements 26 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets, such as cash balances including fixed deposits and cash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments, trade and other receivables.
The Group is also exposed in its net asset position to its own credit risk in respect of the 2023 debentures which are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
The Group establishes anallowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of specific trade and other receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable.
When the debt is deemed irrecoverable, the allowance account is written off against the underlying receivable.
In the US, sales to three wholesalers accounted for approximately 83% of US sales 2015:three wholesalers accounted for approximately 84%: 2014:three wholesalers accounted for approximately 75%.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: 2016 2015 2014 $m $m $m Not past due 2,559 4,388 4,316 Past due 0-90 days 14 189 354 Past due 90-180 days 21 75 Past due 180 days 10 35 17 2,583 4,633 4,762 2016 2015 2014 $m $m $m Movements in provisions for trade receivables At 1 January 52 54 64 Income statement 2 2 Amounts utilised, exchange and other movements 10 4 8 At 31December 42 52 54 The allowance for impairment has been calculated based on past experience and is in relation to specific customers.
Given the profile of our customers, including large wholesalers and government-backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables notpast due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.
The income statement charge is recorded in selling, general and administrative costs.
Other financial assets The Group may hold significant cash balances as part of its normal operations, with the amount of cash held at any point reflecting the level of cash flow generated by the business and the timing of the use of that cash.
The majority of excess cash is centralised within the Group treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal invested.
This risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising security and liquidity over return, and as such cash is only invested in high credit quality investments.
Counterparty limits are set according to the assessed risk of each counterparty and exposures are monitored against these limits on a regular basis.
The majority of the Groups cash is invested in US dollar AAA-rated liquidity funds, fully collateralised repurchase agreements, fixed income securities and short-term bank deposits.
The most significant concentration of financial credit risk at 31December 2016 was $3,440m invested in five AAA-rated liquidity funds.
The liquidity fund portfolios are managed by the related external third party fund managers to maintain the AAA rating.
No more than 15% of fund value is invested within each individual fund.
There were no other significant concentrations of financial credit risk at the reporting date.
At 31December 2016, the Group had investments of $950m 2015:$1,050m: 2014:$300m in short-term repurchase agreements, which are fully collateralised investments.
In the event of any default, ownership of the collateral would revert to the Group and would be readily convertible to cash.
All financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice.
The Group has agreements with some bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, equivalent to the market valuation of the derivative positions above a predetermined threshold.
The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31December 2016 was $242m 2015:$451m: 2014:$457m.

The Directors believe that, together with the basic salary system, the Groups employee incentive schemes provide competitive and market-related packages to motivate employees.
They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a whole, through long-term share ownership in the Company.
The Groups current UK, Swedish and US schemes are described below: other arrangements apply elsewhere.
Bonus plans The AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan Employees of participating AstraZeneca UK companies are invited to participate in this bonus plan, which rewards strong individual performance.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme This scheme is a performance bonus scheme for Directors and senior employees who do not participate in the AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash and reflect both corporate and individual performance measures.
TheRemuneration Committee has discretion to reduce or withhold bonuses if business performance falls sufficiently short of expectations in any year such as to make the payment of bonuses inappropriate.
The AstraZeneca Deferred Bonus Plan This plan was introduced in 2006 and is used to defer a portion of the bonus earned under the AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme into Ordinary Shares in the Company for a period of three years.
The plan currently operates only in respect of Executive Directors and members of the SET.
Awards of shares under this plan are typically made in March each year, the first award having been made in February 2006.
Further details of this plan can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report from page103.
Sweden In Sweden, an all-employee performance bonus plan is in operation, which rewards strong individual performance.
Bonuses are paid 50% into a fund investing in AstraZeneca equities and 50% in cash.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme, the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan all operate in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees in Sweden.
US In the US, there are two all-employee short-term or annual performance bonus plans in operation to differentiate and reward strong individual performance.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash.
There is also one senior staff long-term incentive scheme, under which 91 participants may be eligible for awards granted as AstraZeneca ADSs.
AstraZeneca ADSs necessary to satisfy the awards are purchased in the market or funded via a share trust.
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan operate in respect of relevant employees in the US.

Employees may invest up to 1,800 over a 12 month accumulation period and purchase Partnership Shares in the Company with the total proceeds at the end of the period.
The purchase price for the shares is the lower of the price at the beginning or the end of the 12-month period.
In 2010, the Company introduced a Matching Share element, the first award of which was made in 2011.
Currently one Matching Share is awarded for every four Partnership Shares purchased.
Partnership Shares and Matching Shares are held in the HM Revenue & Customs HMRCapproved All-Employee Share Plan.
At the Companys AGM in 2002, shareholders approved the issue of new shares for the purposes of the All-Employee Share Plan.

Research and development collaboration payments The Group has various ongoing collaborations, including in-licensing and similar arrangements with development partners.
Such collaborations may require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones, although the Group generally has the right to terminate these agreements at no cost.
The Group recognises research and development milestones as intangible assets once it is committed to payment, which is generally when the Group reaches set trigger points in the development cycle.
Revenue-related milestones are recognised as intangible assets on product launch at a value based on the Groups long-term revenue forecasts for the related product.
The table below indicates potential development and revenue-related payments that the Group may be required to make under such collaborations.

Revenue-related milestone payments represent the maximum possible amount payable on achievement of specified levels of revenue as set out in individual contract agreements, but exclude variable payments that are based on unit sales eg royalty-type payments which are expensed as the associated sale is recognised.
The table excludes any payments already capitalised in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31December 2016.
The future payments we disclose represent contracted payments and, as such, are not discounted and are not risk adjusted.
As detailed in the Risk section from page214, the development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex and risky process that may fail at any stage in the development process due to a number of factors including items such as failure to obtain regulatory approval, unfavourable data from key studies, adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns.
The timing of the payments is based on the Groups current best estimate of achievement of the relevant milestone.
Environmental costs and liabilities The Groups expenditure on environmental protection, including both capital and revenue items, relates to costs that are necessary for implementing internal systems and programmes, and meeting legal and regulatory requirements for processes and products.
This includes investment to conserve natural resources and otherwise minimise the impact of our activities on the environment.
They are an integral part of normal ongoing expenditure for carrying out the Groups research, manufacturing and commercial operations and are not separated from overall operating and development costs.
There are no known changes in legal, regulatory or other requirements resulting in material changes to the levels of expenditure for 2014, 2015 or 2016.
In addition to expenditure for meeting current and foreseen environmental protection requirements, the Group incurs costs in investigating and cleaning up land and groundwater contamination.
In particular, AstraZeneca has environmental liabilities at some currently or formerly owned, leased and third party sites.
In the US, Zeneca Inc. and or its indemnitees, have been named as potentially responsible parties PRPs or defendants at approximately 14 sites where Zeneca Inc. is likely to incur future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs under federal, state, statutory or common law environmental liability allocation schemes together, US Environmental Consequences.
Similarly, Stauffer Management Company LLC SMC, which was established in 1987 to own and manage certain assets of Stauffer Chemical Company acquired that year, and or its indemnitees, have been named as PRPs or defendants at 34 sites where SMC is likely to incur US Environmental Consequences.
AstraZeneca has also given indemnities to third parties for a number of sites outside the US.
These environmental liabilities arise from legacy operations that are not currently part of the Groups business and, at most of these sites, remediation, where required, is either completed or nearing completion.
AstraZeneca has made provisions for the estimated costs of future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance activity beyond normal ongoing expenditure for maintaining the Groups R&D and manufacturing capacity and product ranges, where a present obligation exists, it is probable that such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated reliably.
With respect to such estimated future costs, there were provisions at 31December 2016 in the aggregate of $59m 2015:$67m: 2014:$84m, mainly relating to the US.
Where we are jointly liable or otherwise have cost-sharing agreements with third parties, we reflect only our share of the obligation.
Where the liability is insured in part or in whole by insurance or other arrangements for reimbursement, an asset is recognised to the extent that this recovery is virtually certain.
It is possible that AstraZeneca could incur future environmental costs beyond the extent of our current provisions.
The extent of such possible additional costs is inherently difficult to estimate due to a number of factors, including: 1 the nature and extent of claims that may be asserted in thefuture: 2 whether AstraZeneca has or will have any legal obligation with respect to asserted or unasserted claims: 3 the type of remedial action, if any, that may be selected at sites where the remedy is presently not known: 4 the potential for recoveries from or allocation of liability to third parties: and 5 the length of time that the environmental investigation, remediation and liability allocation process can take.
Notwithstanding and subject to the foregoing, we estimate the potential additional loss for future environmental investigation, remediation, remedial operation and maintenance activity above and beyond our provisions to be, in aggregate, between $85m and $141m 2015:$71m and $119m: 2014:$50m and $80m, which relates mainly to the US.
