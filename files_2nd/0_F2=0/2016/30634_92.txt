Share-based payments We have a number of share plans used to award shares to Directors and employees as part of their remuneration package.
A charge is recognised over the vesting period in the consolidated income statement to record the cost of these, based on the fair value of the award on the grant date.
Accounting policies The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
A corresponding increase in retained earnings is also recognised.
Some share awards have an attached market condition, based on total shareholder return TSR, which is taken into account when calculating thefair value of the share awards.
The valuation for the TSR is based on Vodafones ranking within the same group of companies, where possible, over the past five years.
The fair value of awards of non-vested shares is equal to the closing price of the Groups shares on the date of grant, adjusted for the present value of the delay in receiving dividends where appropriate.
The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be issued in respect of share options or share plans will not without shareholder approval exceed: a 10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number of ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans: and a 5% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number of ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans, other than any plans which are operated on an all-employee basis.
Share options Vodafone Group executive plans No share options have been granted to any Directors or employees under the Companys discretionary share option plans in the year ended 31 March 2016.
There are options outstanding under the Vodafone Group 1999 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan and the Vodafone Global Incentive Plan.
These options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.

Share plans Vodafone Group executive plans Under the Vodafone Global Incentive Plan awards of shares are granted to Directors and certain employees.
