Intangible assets Intangible assets consist of goodwill on acquisitions of $62.0m, purchased syndicate capacity of $10.7m, US admitted licences of $9.3m, renewal rights of $7.0m and capitalised expenditure on IT projects of $7.6m.
Reinsurance assets Reinsurance assets represent recoveries from reinsurers in respect of incurred claims of $853.9m, and the unearned reinsurance premiums reserve of $228.2m.
The reinsurance receivables from reinsurers are split between recoveries on claims paid or notified of $201.8m and an actuarial estimate of recoveries on claims that have not yet been reported of $652.1m.
The groups exposure to reinsurers is managed through: minimising risk through selection of reinsurers who meet strict financial criteria e. g. minimum net assets, minimum A rating by S&P.
These criteria vary by type of business short vs medium tail.
The chart on page 45 shows the profile of these assets based on their S&P rating at the end of 2016: timely calculation and issuance of reinsurance collection notes from our ceded reinsurance team: and regular monitoring of the outstanding debtor position by our reinsurance security committee and credit control committee.
We continue to provide against impairment of reinsurance recoveries, and at the end of 2016 our provision in respect of reinsurance recoveries totalled $12.6m 2015: $13.7m.

Other assets Other assets are analysed separately in the notes to the financial statements.
The largest items included comprise: deferred acquisition costs of $242.8m: profit commissions of $15.2m: and deferred tax assets available for use against future taxes payable of $11.0m.
Judgement is required in determining the policy for deferring acquisition costs.
Beazleys policy assumes that variable reward paid to underwriters relates to prior years business and is not an acquisition cost.
As a result, the quantum of costs classified as acquisition is towards the lower end of the possible range.
Costs identified as related to acquisition are then deferred in line with premium earnings.
Insurance liabilities Insurance liabilities of $4,657.7m consist of two main elements, being the unearned premium reserve UPR and gross insurance claims liabilities.
Our UPR has increased by 8% to $1,140.8m.
The majority of the UPR balance relates to current year premiums that have been deferred and will be earned in future periods.
Current indicators are that this business is profitable.
Gross insurance claims reserves are made up of claims which have been notified to us but not yet paid of $949.5m and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported IBNR of $2,567.4m.
These are estimated as part of the quarterly reserving process involving the underwriters and group actuary.
Gross insurance claims reserves are broadly unchanged from 2015 at $3,516.9m.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities comprise borrowings and derivative financial liabilities.
The group utilises three long term debt facilities and has increased the aggregate amount of debt during 2016 by $152.8m in anticipation of opportunities to grow the capital supporting group underwriting over the next few years.
An overview of our financial liabilities is included below: in 2006 we raised 150m of lower tier 2 unsecured fixed rate debt that was payable in 2026 and callable in 2016.
In 2012, we bought back a total of 47.3m in two tranches.
In 2013 we bought back 26.2m of this debt.
In October 2016, the group exercised its first call option and redeemed the remaining outstanding nominal amount of debt of 76.5m.
a US$18m subordinated debt facility was raised in 2004.
This loan is also unsecured and interest is payable at the US$ London interbank offered rate LIBOR plus 3.65%.
These subordinated notes are due in 2034 and have been callable at the groups option since 2009: d uring September 2012 we issued a sterling denominated 5.375% retail bond under a 250m euro medium term note programme which raised 75m for the group and is due in 2019.
This diversified the source and maturity profile of the groups debt financing: and in November 2016, Beazley Re dac issued $250m of 5.875% subordinated tier 2 notes due in 2026.
A syndicated short term banking facility led by Lloyds Banking Group plc provides potential borrowings up to $225m.
Under the facility $225m may be drawn as letters of credit to support underwriting at Lloyds.
Of this, 75% may be advanced as cash under a revolving facility.
The cost of the facility is based on a commitment fee of 0.4375% per annum and any amounts drawn are charged at a margin of 1.25% per annum.
The cash element of the facility will expire on 31 July 2017, whilst letters of credit issued under the facility can be used to provide support for the 2015, 2016 and 2017 underwriting years.
The facility is currently unutilised.
com Annual report 2016 Beazley 45 Financial review continued Capital structure Capital structure Beazley has a number of requirements for capital at a group and subsidiary level.
Capital is primarily required to support underwriting at Lloyds and in the US and is subject to prudential regulation by local regulators PRA, Lloyds, Central Bank of Ireland, and the US state level supervisors.
Beazley is subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the European Union EU Solvency II regime SII.
We comply with all relevant SII requirements.
Further capital requirements come from rating agencies who provide ratings for Beazley Insurance Company Inc and Beazley Re dac.
We aim to manage our capital levels to obtain the ratings necessary to trade with our preferred client base.
Beazley holds a level of capital over and above its regulatory requirements.
The amount of surplus capital held is considered on an ongoing basis in light of the current regulatory framework and opportunities for organic or acquisitive growth and a desire to maximise returns for investors.
The group actively seeks to manage its capital structure.
Our preferred use of capital is to deploy it on opportunities to underwrite profitably.
However, there may be times in the cycle when the group will generate excess capital and not have the opportunity to deploy it.
At such points in time the board will consider returning capital to shareholders.
In 2016 Beazley Group Limited repaid 76.5m of existing tier 2 subordinated debt at the first call date and Beazley Re dac issued $250m of new tier 2 subordinated debt due 2026, the net proceeds of which will be used along with our retained earnings to support the future growth plans of the group.
On issuance of the new tier 2 subordinated debt, Beazley Re dac was assigned an Insurer Financial Strength IFS rating of A by Fitch.
In 2016, Beazley acquired 2.0m of its own shares into the employee benefit trust.
These were acquired at an average price of 335p and the cost to the group was 6.7m.

com Strategic report Governance Financial statements We signalled at the interim results that we expected the Lloyds ECR to increase, reflecting our plans for growth, and the final figure at year end 2016 is extremely close to our projection once FX movements are taken into account.
The following table sets out the groups capital requirement: 2016 2015 $m $m Lloyds economic capital requirement ECR 1,489.2 1,326.9 Capital for US insurance company 107.7 107.7 1,596.9 1,434.6 At 31 December 2016, we have surplus capital of 44% of ECR on a Solvency II basis.
Following payment of the second interim dividend of 7.0p and special dividend of 10.0p, this surplus reduces to 36% compared to our current target range of 15% to 25% of ECR.
Solvency II The Solvency II regime came into force on 1 January 2016.
From Q1 2016 Beazley has provided quarterly Solvency II pillar 3 reporting to both Lloyds for the Beazley managed syndicates and the Central Bank of Ireland for Beazley Re dac and Beazley plc.
Our project to prepare for the pillar 3 reporting requirements is nearing completion and will remain in place until annual reporting for 31 December 2016 is complete.
We believe we are well positioned to meet all the reporting requirements.
Solvency capital requirement The group is required to produce a Solvency Capital Requirement SCR which sets out the amount of capital that is required to reflect the risks contained within the business.
Lloyds reviews this assessment to ensure that SCRs are consistent across the market.
On 10 December 2015 Beazley received internal model approval from the Central Bank of Ireland the group supervisor under Solvency II.
The current SCR has been established using our Solvency II approved internal model which has been run within the regime as prescribed by Lloyds.
In order to perform the capital assessment, we have made significant investments in both models and process: we use sophisticated mathematical models that reflect the key risks in the business allowing for probability of occurrence, impact if they do occur, and interaction between risk types.
A key focus of these models is to understand the risk posed to individual teams, and to the business as a whole, of a possible deterioration in the underwriting cycle: and the internal model process is embedded so that teams can see the direct and objective link between underwriting decisions and the capital allocated to that team.
This gives a consistent and comprehensive picture of the risk reward profile of the business and allows teams to focus on strategies that improve return on capital.
