2 Significant accounting policies a Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and the Companies Act 2006.
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 are set out below.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, as explained below.
These accounting policies have been consistently applied, except for the effects of the adoption of new and amended accounting standard.
The financial statements are presented in US dollars $ and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand $000 except when otherwise indicated.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
Details of the factors which have been taken into account in assessing the Groups going concern status are set out within the Directors report.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statement for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Amendments to standards and interpretations which came into force during the year did not have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been previously adopted by the Group Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 or later periods but which the Group has not previously adopted.
Those that are applicable to the Group are as follows: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
This standard outlines the principles an entity must apply to measure and recognise revenue.
The Group is planning to apply the standard when it becomes mandatory, analysing all the variables during the first quarter of 2017, including the method of implementation and the restatement of the previous year financial information.
IFRS 15 is not expected to have a significant effect on the financial statements.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 is the replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The standard includes requirements for recognition and measurement, impairment, derecognition and general hedge accounting.
IFRS 9 should be applied retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, subject to certain exemptions and exceptions.
The Group do not anticipate a significant effect over the financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 specifies how an IFRS reporter will recognise, measure, present and disclose leases.
The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value.
Lessors continue to classify leases as operating or finance, with IFRS 16s approach to lessor accounting substantially unchanged from its predecessor, IAS 17.
The Group is analysing the adoption of this new standard and expected not to have a significant impact on the Groups financial position or performance.
IAS 7 Statement of cash flows, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
The amendments require entities to provide disclosures about changes in their liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes.
The adoption of these amendments would not have impact on the Groups financial position or performance.
IAS 12 Income Taxes, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
The amendments clarify the accounting for deferred tax assets for unrealised losses on debt instruments measured at fair value.
Entities are required to apply the amendments retrospectively.
The adoption of these rules would not have impact on the Groups financial position or performance.
com 81 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions - Amendments to IFRS 2, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The amendments are related to the classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions and it does not require to restate prior periods.
The Group is analysing the effect of the standards and plans to adopt the new standards on the required effective date.
b Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty Many of the amounts included in the financial statements involve the use of judgement and or estimation.
These judgements and estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements.
Information about such judgements and estimates is contained in the accounting policies and or the notes to the financial statements.
Significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements include: Significant estimates: Determination of useful lives of assets for depreciation and amortisation purposes note 2 e. Estimates are required to be made by management as to the useful lives of assets.
For depreciation calculated under the unit of-production method, estimated recoverable reserves and resources are used in determining the depreciation and or amortisation of mine-specific assets.
This results in a depreciation amortisation charge proportional to the depletion of the anticipated remaining life-of-mine production.
Each items life, which is assessed annually, has regard to both its physical life limitations and to present assessments of economically recoverable reserves and resources of the mine property at which the asset is located.
These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions, including the amount of recoverable reserves and resources.
Changes are accounted for prospectively.
Determination of ore reserves and resources note 2 g. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves and resources.
Assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available.
Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may change the economic status of reserves and resources and may, ultimately, result in the reserves and resources being restated.
Review of non-financial asset carrying values and impairment charges or reversals 2 i, 16, 17 and 18.
The assessment of asset carrying values requires the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance.
Changes in these assumptions will affect the recoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment, evaluation and exploration assets, and intangibles.
Estimation of the amount and timing of mine closure costs notes 2 m and 26.
The Group assesses its mine closure cost provision annually.
Significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision for mine closure cost as there are numerous factors that will affect the ultimate liability payable.
These factors include estimates of the extent and costs of rehabilitation activities, technological changes, regulatory changes, cost increases, mine life and changes in discount rates.
Those uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided.
The provision at the balance sheet date represents managements best estimate of the present value of the future closure costs required.
Significant estimates and assumptions for cash-settled transactions notes 26 3.
The Group initially measures the cost of cash-settled transactions with employees using the Monte Carlo model to determine the fair value of the liability incurred.
The liability needs to be remeasured at the end of each reporting period up to the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised in the profit or loss.
This requires a reassessment of the estimates used at the end of each reporting period, including the anticipated potential changes to the Total Shareholder Return TSR performance, the number of participants in the plan, and levels of interest rates.
The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value are discussed in note 26 3.
Significant estimates and assumptions for assets classified as held for salenote 23.
To determine whether an asset should be classified as an asset held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, consideration should be given as to whether the sale highly probable.
The three main criteria are: There is a plan in place to sell the asset, the sale is due to complete within 12 months of the year end: and that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the sale withdrawn.
As disclosed in note 23, despite the final payment date for the sale of San Felipe property being within twelve months, all the three criteria to be considered highly probable as defined by IFRS 5 have not been met and therefore the property has not been classified as an assets held for sale.
82 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 82 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 Financial statements Critical judgements: Production start date.
The Group assesses the stage of each mine under development construction to determine when a mine moves into the production phase, this being when the mine is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.
The criteria used to assess the start date are determined based on the unique nature of each mine development construction project, such as the complexity of the project and its location.
The Group considers various relevant criteria to assess when the production phase is considered to have commenced.
At this point, all related amounts are reclassified from Construction in progress to the corresponding type of Property, plant and equipment.
Some of the criteria used to identify the production start date include, but are not limited to: Level of capital expenditure incurred compared with the original construction cost estimate Completion of a reasonable period of testing of the mine plant and equipment Ability to produce product in saleable form within specifications Ability to sustain ongoing production of product When a mine development project moves into the production phase, the capitalisation of certain mine development costs ceases and costs are either regarded as forming part of the cost of inventory or expensed, except for costs that qualify for capitalisation relating to mining asset additions or improvements, underground mine development or mineable reserve development.
It is also at this point that depreciation amortisation commences.
Based on the above criteria in determining when Inmaculada moved into the production phase, it was determined by management that the start date was 1 August 2015.
Determination of functional currencies note 2 d. The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be several currencies in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates.
Judgement is required in determining whether deferred tax assets are recognised in the statement of financial position.
Deferred tax assets, including those arising from un-utilised tax losses require management to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets.
Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction.
To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted.
Judgement is also required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities.
Provisions are also made for uncertain exposures which can have an impact on both deferred and current tax.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained and tax provisions are made if it is possible that a liability will arise.
The final resolution of these transactions may give rise to material adjustments to the income statement and or cashflow in future periods.
The Group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit each period to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
Recognition of evaluation and exploration assets and transfer to development costs notes 2 f, 16 and 17.
Judgement is required in determining when the future economic benefit of a project can reasonably be regarded as assured, at which point evaluation and exploration expenses are capitalised.
This includes the assessment of whether there is sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals to justify the commencement of capitalisation of costs: the timing of the end of the exploration phase: the start of the development phase: and the commencement of the production phase.
For this purpose, the future economic benefit of the project can reasonably be regarded as assured when the Board authorises management to conduct a feasibility study, mine-site exploration is being conducted to convert resources to reserves, or mine-site exploration is being conducted to confirm resources, all of which are based on supporting geological information.
Recoverable values of mining assets notes 16, 17 and 18.
The values of the Groups mining assets are sensitive to a range of characteristics unique to each mine unit.
Key sources of estimation for all assets include uncertainty around ore reserve estimates and cash flow projections.
In performing impairment reviews, the Group assesses the recoverable amount of its operating assets principally with reference to fair value less costs of disposal, assessed using discounted cash flow models.
There is judgement involved in determining the assumptions that are considered to be reasonable and consistent with those that would be applied by market participants.
Key judgements include the estimation of future gold and silver prices, mine production projections and the application of discount rates which reflect the macro-economic risk in Peru and Argentina as applicable.
com 83 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements set out the Groups financial position, performance and cash flows as at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 and for the years then ended, respectively.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group regardless of the amount of shares owned by the Group.
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Non-controlling interests rights to safeguard their interest are fully considered in assessing whether the Group controls a subsidiary.
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: power over the investee i. e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee : exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control.
To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee: rights arising from other contractual arrangements: and the Groups voting rights and potential voting rights.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction, affecting retained earnings.
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it i derecognises the assets including goodwill and liabilities of the subsidiary: ii derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest NCI : iii derecognises the cumulative translation differences, recorded in equity: iv recognises the fair value of the consideration received: v recognises the fair value of any investment retained: vi recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss: and vii reclassifies the parents share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate.
An NCI represents the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly and indirectly, to the parent company and is presented separately within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position, separately from equity attributable to owners of the parent.
Losses within a subsidiary are attributable to the NCI even if that results in a deficit balance.
Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any NCI in the acquiree.
The choice of measurement of NCI, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets, is determined on a transaction by transaction basis.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the NCI, and any previously interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions separate to the business combinations, such as the settlement of pre-existing relationships or post-acquisition remuneration arrangements, are accounted for separately from the business combination in accordance with their nature and applicable IFRSs.
Identifiable intangible assets meeting either the contractual-legal or the separability criterion are recognised separately from goodwill.
Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition date fair value can be measured reliably.
d Currency translation The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
For the holding companies and operating entities this currency is US dollars and for the other entities it is the local currency of the country in which it operates.
The Groups financial information is presented in US dollars, which is the Companys functional currency.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are initially recorded in the functional currency using the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the rate of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date.
Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions which are translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities which are translated at period-end exchange rates, are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Exchange differences arising from monetary items that are part of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in equity and transferred to income on disposal of such net investment.
84 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 84 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 Financial statements Subsidiary financial statements expressed in their corresponding functional currencies are translated into US dollars by applying the exchange rate at period-end for assets and liabilities and the transaction date exchange rate for income statement items.
The resulting difference on consolidation is included as cumulative translation adjustment in equity.
e Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost comprises its purchase price and directly attributable costs of acquisition or construction required to bring the asset to the condition necessary for the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
Economical and physical conditions of assets have not changed substantially over this period.
The cost less residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life.
Each items estimated useful life has been assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves and resources of the mine property at which the item is located.
Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items.
Depreciation is charged to cost of production on a units of production basis for mine buildings and installations and plant and equipment used in the mining production process, or charged directly to the income statement over the estimated useful life of the individual asset on a straight-line basis when not related to the mining production process.
Changes in estimates, which mainly affect units of production calculations, are accounted for prospectively.
Depreciation commences when assets are available for use.
An assets carrying amount is written-down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the net proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within other income expenses, in the income statement.
The expected useful lives under the straight-line method are as follows: Years Buildings 3 to 33 Plant and equipment 5 to 10 Vehicles 5 Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to be ready for its intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
All other borrowing costs are expensed where incurred.
For borrowings associated with a specific asset, the actual rate on that borrowing is used.
Otherwise, a weighted average cost of borrowing is used.
The Group capitalises the borrowing costs related to qualifying assets with a value of US$1,000,000 or more, considering that the substantial period of time to be ready is six or more months.
Mining properties and development costs Purchased mining properties are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of a business combination.
Costs associated with developments of mining properties are capitalised.
Mine development costs are, upon commencement of commercial production, depreciated using the units of production method based on the estimated economically recoverable reserves and resources to which they relate.
When a mine construction project moves into the production stage, the capitalisation of certain mine construction costs ceases and costs are either regarded as part of the cost of inventory or expensed, except for costs which qualify for capitalisation relating to mining asset additions or improvements, underground mine development or mineable reserve development.
In addition, the revenue generated by the sale of the inventory produced during the pre-operating stage is recognised as a deduction of the costs capitalised for this project.
Construction in progress and capital advances Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment.
Once the asset moves into the production phase, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category.
Construction in progress is not depreciated.
Subsequent expenditure Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is capitalised separately with the carrying amount of the component being written off.
Other subsequent expenditure is capitalised if future economic benefits will arise from the expenditure.
All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditures are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
f Evaluation and exploration assets Evaluation and exploration expenses are capitalised when the future economic benefit of the project can reasonably be regarded as assured.
Projects in the development phase Exploration and evaluation costs are capitalised as assets from the date that the Board authorises management to conduct a feasibility study.
Expenditure is transferred to mine development costs once the work completed to date supports the future development of the property and such development receives appropriate approval.
com 85 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Identification of resources Costs incurred in converting inferred resources to indicated and measured resources of which reserves are a component are capitalised as incurred.
Costs incurred in identifying inferred resources are expensed as incurred.
g Determination of ore reserves and resources The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by internal competent persons.
Reports to support these estimates are prepared each year and are stated in conformity with the 2012 Joint Ore Reserves Committee JORC code.
It is the Groups policy to have the report audited by a Competent Person.
Reserves and resources are used in the units of production calculation for depreciation as well as the determination of the timing of mine closure cost and impairment analysis.
h Intangible assets Right to use energy transmission line Transmission line costs represent the investment made by the Group during the period of its use.
This is an asset with a finite useful life equal to that of the mine to which it relates and that is amortised applying the units of production method for that mine.
Water permits Water permits represent the cost that allow the holder to withdraw a specified amount of water from the ground for reasonable, beneficial uses.
This is an asset with an indefinite useful life.
Legal rights Legal rights correspond to expenditures required to give the Group the right to use a property for the surface exploration work, development and production.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are primarily computer software which are capitalised at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life of three years.
i Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and evaluation and exploration assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether the carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount.
Such review is undertaken on an asset-by-asset basis, except where such assets do not generate cash flows independent of other assets, and then the review is undertaken at the cash-generating unit level.
The assessment requires the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance.
Changes in these assumptions will affect the recoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment and evaluation and exploration assets.
If the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit CGU exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment provision is recorded to reflect the asset at the lower amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their value in use VIU and fair value less costs of disposal FVLCD to sell.
FVLCD is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in a sale transaction on an arms length basis.
VIU is based on estimated future cash flows discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independent of those from other assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable values of the CGU are determined using a FVLCD methodology.
FVLCD was determined using a combination of level 2 and level 3 inputs to construct a discounted cash flow model to estimate the amount that would be paid by a willing third party in an arm's length transaction.
Reversal of impairment An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
86 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 86 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 Financial statements j Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the weighted average method.
The cost of work in progress and finished goods ore inventories is based on the cost of production.
For this purpose, the costs of production include: costs, materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore: depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore: and related production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
k Trade and other receivables Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables.
Non-current receivables are stated at amortised cost.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable which on average, do not exceed 30 days.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount and this difference is recognised in the income statement.
l Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Any excess above the par value of shares received upon issuance of those shares is classified as share premium.
In the case the excess above par value is available for distribution, it is classified as merger reserve and then transferred to retained earnings.
m Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Mine closure cost Provisions for mine closure costs are made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure and restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs.
The provision is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs.
At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised and is depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates.
The provision is reviewed on an annual basis for changes in cost estimates, discount rates and operating lives.
Changes to estimated future costs are recognised in the statement of financial position by adjusting the mine closure cost liability and the related asset originally recognised.
If, for mature mines, the related mine assets net of mine closure cost provisions exceed the recoverable value, that portion of the increase is charged directly to the income statement.
Similarly, reductions to the estimated costs exceeding the carrying value of the mine asset, that portion of the decrease is credited directly to the income statement.
For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Workers profit sharing and other employee benefits In accordance with Peruvian legislation, companies in Peru must provide for workers profit sharing equivalent to 8% of taxable income of each year.
This amount is charged to the income statement within personnel expenses note 10 and is considered deductible for income tax purposes.
The Group has no pension or retirement benefit schemes.
Other Other provisions are accounted for when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation for which it is probable there will be an outflow of resources for which the amount can be reliably estimated.
n Share-based payments Cash-settled transactions The fair value of cash-settled share plans is recognised as a liability over the vesting period of the awards.
Movements in that liability between reporting dates are recognised as personnel expenses.
The fair value of the awards is taken to be the market value of the shares at the date of award adjusted by a factor for anticipated relative TSR performance.
Fair values are subsequently remeasured at each reporting date to reflect the number of awards expected to vest based on the current and anticipated TSR performance.
com 87 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in other reserves in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that vest.
The income statement expense for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in personnel expenses note 10. o Contingencies Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements and are disclosed in notes to the financial statements unless their occurrence is remote.
Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements, but are disclosed in the notes if their recovery is deemed probable.
p Revenue recognition The Group is involved in the production and sale of gold and silver from dor and concentrate containing both gold and silver.
Dor bars are either sold directly to customers or are sent to a third-party for further refining into gold and silver before they are sold.
Concentrate is sold directly to customers.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue associated with the sale of gold and silver from dor and concentrate is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has passed to the customer.
Revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes.
The revenue is subject to adjustment based on inspection of the product by the customer.
Revenue is initially recognised on a provisional basis using the Groups best estimate of contained gold and silver.
Any subsequent adjustments to the initial estimate of metal content are recorded in revenue once they have been determined.
In addition, certain sales are provisionally priced where the selling price is subject to final adjustment at the end of a period, normally ranging from 15 to 90 days after the start of the delivery process to the customer, based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated in the contract.
Revenue is initially recognised when the conditions set out above have been met, using market prices at that date.
The price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and hence separated from the sales contract at each reporting date.
The provisionally priced metal is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the contract until the quotational period ends.
The selling price of gold and silver can be measured reliably as these metals are actively traded on international exchanges.
The revaluation of provisionally priced contracts is recorded as an adjustment to revenue.
Income from services provided to related parties note 30 is recognised in revenue when services are provided.
Deferred revenue results when cash is received in advance of revenue being earned.
Deferred revenue is recorded as a liability until it is earned.
Once earned, the liability is reduced and revenue is recorded.
The Group analyses when revenue is earned or deferred.
q Finance income and costs Finance income and costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, the accumulation of interest on provisions, interest income on funds invested, unwind of discount, gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments and gains and losses on the disposal of available-forsale investments.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the asset.
r Income tax Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: and in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
88 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 88 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 Financial statements A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
s Uncertain tax positions An estimated tax liability is recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Separate provisions for interest and penalties are also recorded if appropriate.
Movements in interest and penalty amounts in respect of tax provisions are not included in the tax charge, but are disclosed in the income statement.
Tax provisions are based on managements interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
This involves a significant amount of judgement as tax legislation can be complex and open to different interpretation.
Management uses in-house tax experts, professional firms and previous experience when assessing tax risks.
Where actual tax liabilities differ from the provisions, adjustments are made which can have a material impact on the Groups profits for the year.
Refer to note 34 b for specific tax contingencies.
t Leases Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are reflected in the income statement.
The depreciation policy for leased assets is consistent with that for similar assets owned.
A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
u Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them and are classified as loans or borrowings, receivables, payables, financial instruments fair valued through profit and loss, available-for-sale financial assets or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge refer to note 2 y, as appropriate.
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year-end.
When financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss and borrowings, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Group considers whether a contract contains an embedded derivative when the entity first becomes a party to it.
The embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract if it is not measured at fair value through profit or loss and when the economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract.
Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required.
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Regular way transactions require delivery and receipt of assets within the timeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as follows: Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss includes financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit and loss.
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term.
Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments or a financial guarantee contract.
Gains or losses on financial assets held for trading are recognised in the income statement.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified as loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or financial assets at fair value through profit and loss.
After initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value with unrealised gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or until the investment is determined to be impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the income statement.
Loans and borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
com 89 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the statement of financial position date.
Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each statement of financial position date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Available-for-sale financial assets For available-for-sale AFS financial investments, the Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an investment or a group of investments is impaired.
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost, where significant is estimated to be around 30% of the original cost of the investment and prolonged is more than 12 months.
In addition, the Group analyses any case taking into account the portfolio of projects of the investee, the key technical personnel and the viability of the investee to finance its projects.
If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost net of any principal payment and amortisation and its fair value is transferred from equity to the income statement.
Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are reversed through the income statement, if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss.
Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement.
Derecognition of financial instruments A financial asset or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised when: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third-party under a pass-through arrangement: and either: a the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset: or b the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, a new asset is recognised to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement in the asset.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset, is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
A financial liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
v Dividend distribution Dividends on the Companys ordinary shares are recognised when they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer at the Companys discretion.
Accordingly, interim dividends are recognised when they are paid and final dividends are recognised when they are declared following approval by shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting.
w Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at cost.
For the purposes of the statement of financial position, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents, as defined above, are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Liquidity funds are classified as cash equivalents if the amount of cash that will be received is known at the time of the initial investment and the risk of changes in value is considered insignificant.
90 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 90 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 Financial statements x Exceptional items Exceptional items are those significant items which, due to their nature or the expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, need to be disclosed separately on the face of the income statement to enable a better understanding of the financial performance of the Group and facilitate comparison with prior years.
Exceptional items mainly include: impairments or write offs of assets, assets held for sale, property, plant and equipment and evaluation and exploration assets: gains or losses arising on the disposal of subsidiaries, investments or property, plant and equipment: fair value gains or losses arising on financial instruments not held in the normal course of trading: any gain or loss resulting from restructuring within the Group: taxes and interests owed by the Group following a change in circumstances surrounding tax disputes, resulting in the exposure being assessed as probable: the impact of infrequent labour action related to work stoppages in mine units: the penalties generated by the early termination of agreements with providers of the Group: the reversal of an accumulation of prior years tax expenses that resulted from an agreement with the government: and the related tax impact of the above items.
y Hedging The Group uses commodity swaps and zero cost collar contracts to hedge certain of its cash flows from product sales against price risk.
These derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
The fair value of these forward contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
These forward contracts are classified as cash flow hedges as they are hedging the Groups exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a highly probable forecast sales transaction.
At the inception of a hedging relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged items fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine their effectiveness in the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.
Where the commodity forward contracts meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
In the case of zero cost collar contracts, the time value has to be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, in consequence the change in the time value will be recognised in the income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the forecast transaction occurs.
If the forecast sales transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast sales transaction occurs.
z Fair value measurement The Group measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives, and non-financial assets at fair value at each statement of financial position date.
Also, fair values of financial instruments are measured at amortised cost.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: In the principal market for the asset or liability, or In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
com 91 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participants ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, as described in note 36 e. For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
The Group determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement and unquoted AFS financial assets, and for non-recurring measurement.
External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets and significant liabilities.
Involvement of external valuers is decided upon annually by the Group after discussion with and approval by the Companys Audit Committee.
Selection criteria include market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained.
Valuers are normally rotated every three years.
The Group decides, after discussions with the external valuers, which valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case.
At each reporting date, the Group analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be re-measured or re-assessed as per the Groups accounting policies.
For this analysis, the Group verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to contracts and other relevant documents.
The Group, in conjunction with its external valuers, where applicable, also compares each the changes in the fair value of each asset and liability with relevant external sources to determine whether the change is reasonable.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
3 Segment reporting The Groups activities are principally related to mining operations which involve the exploration, production and sale of gold and silver.
Products are subject to the same risks and returns and are sold through similar distribution channels.
The Group undertakes a number of activities solely to support mining operations including power generation and services.
Transfer prices between segments are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to that used for third parties.
Segment revenue, segment expense and segment results include transfers between segments at market prices.
Those transfers are eliminated on consolidation.
For internal reporting purposes, management takes decisions and assesses the performance of the Group through consideration of the following reporting segments: Operating units Arcata and San Jose, which generate revenue from the sale of gold, silver, dor and concentrate.
Operating unit Pallancata, which generates revenue from the sale of concentrate.
Operating unit Inmaculada, which generates revenue from the sale of gold, silver and dor.
Exploration, which explores and evaluates areas of interest in brownfield and greenfield sites with the aim of extending the life-of-mine of existing operations and to assess the feasibility of new mines.
The exploration segment includes costs charged to the profit and loss and capitalised as assets.
Other includes the profit or loss generated by Empresa fide Transmisin Callalli S. A. C. a power transmission company, absorbed by Empresa fide Transmisin Aymaraes S. A. C. on 1 June 2016, Empresa fide Transmisin Aymaraes S. A. C. a power transmission company, Ares unit, and the Selene plant used to process some of the Groups production.
The Groups administration, financing, other activities including other income and expense, and income taxes are managed at a corporate level and are not allocated to operating segments.
Segment information is consistent with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Management evaluates the financial information based on International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union.
The Group measures the performance of its operating units by the segment profit or loss that comprises gross profit, selling expenses and exploration expenses.
Segment assets include items that could be allocated directly to the segment.

Exploration expenses are generally incurred in the following areas: mapping, sampling, geophysics, identification of local targets and reconnaissance drilling.
3 Generative expenditure is early stage exploration expenditure related to the basic evaluation of the region to identify prospects that have the geological conditions necessary to contain mineral deposits.
Related activities include regional and field reconnaissance, satellite images, compilation of public information and identification of exploration targets.

com 103 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 16 Property, plant and equipment continued At the end of 2015, given the continued challenging environment for the mining sector, the Group carried out an impairment review of all of its operating mines Arcata, Pallancata, Inmaculada and San Jose, and its growth projects Crespo, Azuca, San Felipe and Volcan.
As a result of this review the Group recognised an impairment charge in the Pallancata mine unit of US$39,026,000, the Arcata mine unit of US$72,424,000, the Crespo project of US$14,350,000, the Azuca project of US$12,766,000, San Felipe project of US$10,927,000 and the Volcan project of US$57,070,000.
The impairment recognised in property plant and equipment was US$118,653,000, in evaluation and exploration assets was US$74,550,000 and in intangibles was US$13,360,000 refer to note 17 and 18.
The recoverable values of these CGUs were determined using a fair value less costs of disposal FVLCD methodology.

The methodology is used to determine the fair value less costs of disposal of the Azuca, Volcan which includes the water permits held by the Group, and San Felipe CGUs.
The enterprise value used in the calculation performed at 31 December 2015 was US$6.55 per gold equivalent ounce of resources Volcan, US$0.25 per silver equivalent ounce of resources Azuca and US$16.21 per zinc equivalent tonne of resources San Felipe.
The enterprise value figures are based on observable external market information.

The present value of the provision has been calculated using a real pre-tax annual discount rate, based on a US Treasury bond of an appropriate tenure adjusted for the impact of quantitative easing as at 31 December 2016 and 2015 respectively, and the cash flows have been adjusted to reflect the risk attached to these cash flows.
Uncertainties on the timing for use of this provision include changes in the future that could impact the time of closing the mines, as new resources and reserves are discovered.
Expected cash flows will be over a period from two to nine years.
2 Corresponds to the provision related to awards granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP to designated personnel of the Group.
Includes the following benefits: i 2016 awards, granted in March 2016, payable in March 2019 ii 2015 awards, granted in March 2015, payable in March 2018.
Only employees who remain in the Groups employment on the vesting date will be entitled to a cash payment, subject to exceptions approved by the Remuneration Committee of the Board.
The percentage of the award granted is determined 70% by the Companys TSR ranking relative to a tailored peer group of mining companies, and 30% by the Companys TSR ranking relative to a peer group of FTSE 350 companies.
The liability for the LTIP is measured, initially and at the end of each reporting period until settled, at the fair value of the awards, by applying the Monte Carlo pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions on which the awards were granted, and the extent to which the employees have rendered services to date.
Changes to the provision of US$9,965,000 2015: US$369,000 have been recorded as administrative expenses US$9,298,000 2015: US$372,000 and exploration expenses US$667,000 2014: US$-3,000 credit.

3 Based on the 2016 internal and external review of mine rehabilitation estimates, the provision for mine closure decreased by US$11,975,000.
The net decrease mainly corresponds to the Arcata mine unit of US$6,648,000, the Ares mine unit of US$1,622,000, the Selene mine unit of US$698,000, the Pallancata mine unit of US$447,000, and the San Jos mine unit of US$4,166,000, net of the increase in Inmaculada mine unit of US$1,651,000.
US$2,320,000 related to mines already closed and US$4,026,000 related to the Arcata mine unit which reduction of the estimated costs exceeded the carrying value of the mine asset.
Therefore, both effects have been recognised as a credit directly in the income statement.
In 2015, the internal review of mine rehabilitation budgets determined a recognition of an increase of US$15,517,000.
The net increase mainly corresponds to the Arcata mine unit of US$1,746,000, the Inmaculada mine unit of US$1,133,000, the Selene mine unit of US$922,000, the Crespo project of US$116,000, the San Jos mine unit of US$5,071,000, and the Sipan mine unit of US$6,750,000 net of the decrease in Pallancata mine unit of US$171,000 of which US$7,590,000 related to mines already closed has been recognised directly in the income statement.

i Restricted Share Plan RSP At the beginning of 2015, the Group introduced the RSP, which is a new one-off share-based long-term incentive plan for some executives and key employees who play a fundamental role in the performance of the business.
On 30 December 2014 and 16 February 2015, 1,319,392 and 6,026,089 share options with a fair value of 86.8p US$1.35 and 92.3p US$1.42 per share were granted to the CEO and certain key employees, respectively under the RSP of the Group.
Following the rights issue in October 2015, the number of share options were adjusted to 1,491,572 and 6,812,485 with a fair value of 76.7p US$1.19 and 81.6p US$1.25 per share respectively.
The vesting of the options is subject to the satisfaction of certain performance as well as service conditions classified as non-market conditions.
The options vest over a five-year period in tranches of 20% of the shares after each of 2, 3 and 4 years and the balance after 5 years.
If the service conditions are not met, the options lapse.
As the performance conditions are non-market-based they are not reflected in the fair value of the award at grant date, and therefore the Company will assess the likelihood of these conditions being met with a relevant adjustment to the cumulative charge as required at each financial year end.
The fair value of the option was determined with respect to the market price of the shares on the grant date.
The awards do not entitle the recipients to dividends or payment in lieu of dividends during the vesting period.
The carrying amount of the share based payment reserve relating to the RSP at 31 December 2016 is US$3,958,000 2015: US$2,843,000 with the amount recognised in the consolidated income statement of US$3,181,000 2015: US$2,843,000.

ii Deferred Bonus Plan DBP At the beginning of 2014, the Group introduced the DBP, as a mechanism to pay the annual bonuses to the employees.
Before the approval of DBP the annual bonuses were paid entirely in cash.
Under the DBP rules a part of the annual bonuses could be deferred into shares for one or two years.
A Deferred Bonus award granted under the Plan, and the terms of that Deferred Bonus award, must be approved in advance by the Directors.
The fair value of the awards was determined with respect to the market price of the shares on the grant date.
The carrying amount of the share based payment reserve relating to the DBP at 31 December 2016 is US$57,000 2015: US$138,000 with the amount recognised in the consolidated income statement of US$76,000 2015: US$469,000.

Further details on the design of the ELTIP award and numbers of awards granted are included in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The fair value of the option was determined using the Monte Carlo model.
The carrying amount of the share based payment reserve relating to the ELTIP at 31 December 2016 is US$1,854,000 2015: US$1,674,000.

com 117 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 33 Commitments a Mining rights purchase options During the ordinary course of business, the Group enters into agreements to carry out exploration under concessions held by third parties.
Generally, under the terms of these agreements, the Group has the option to acquire the concession or invest in the entity holding the concession.
In order to exercise these options the Group must satisfy certain financial and other obligations during the term of the agreement.
The options lapse in the event that the Group does not meet its financial obligations.
At any point in time, the Group may cancel the agreements without penalty, except where specified below.
The Group continually reviews its requirements under the agreements and determines, on an annual basis, whether to proceed with its financial commitment.
Based on managements current intention regarding these projects, the commitments at the statement of financial position date are as follows: As at 31 December 2016 2015 US$000 US$000 Commitment for the subsequent 12 months 350 550 More than one year 4,500 6,450 b Operating lease commitments The Group has a number of operating lease agreements, as a lessee.
As at 31 December 2016 and 2015, the future aggregate minimum lease payments under the operating lease agreements are as follows: For the year ended 31 December 2016 2015 US$000 US$000 Not later than one year 3,802 3,615 Later than one year and not later than five years 1,931 3,433 c Capital commitments For the year ended 31 December 2016 2015 US$000 US$000 Peru 14,296 7,684 Argentina 3,682 4,509 17,978 12,193 34 Contingencies As at 31 December 2016 the Group is subject to various claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
No provision has been made in the financial statements and none of these claims are currently expected to result in any material loss to the Group.
a Taxation Fiscal periods remain open to review by the tax authorities for four years in Peru and five years in Argentina and Mexico, preceding the year of review.
During this time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest.
Under certain circumstances, reviews may cover longer periods.
Because a number of fiscal periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, coupled with the complexity of the Group and the transactions undertaken by it, there remains a risk that significant additional tax liabilities may arise.
As at 31 December 2016, the Group had exposures totalling US$43,931,000 2015: US$34,969,000 which are assessed as possible, rather than probable.
No amounts have been provided in respect of these items.
This predominantly relates to potential tax penalties and related interest on intercompany loans.
Notwithstanding this risk, the Directors believe that managements interpretation of the relevant legislation and assessment of taxation is appropriate and that it is probable that the Groups tax and customs positions will be sustained in the event of a challenge by the tax authorities.
Consequently, the Directors consider that they have made adequate provision for any future outflow of resources and no additional provision is required in respect of these claims or risks.
b Guarantees The Group is required to provide guarantees in Peru in respect of environmental restoration and decommissioning obligations.
The Group has provided for the estimated cost of these activities see note 26.
118 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 118 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 Financial statements 35 Mining royalties Peru In accordance with Peruvian legislation, owners of mining concessions must pay a mining royalty for the exploitation of metallic and non-metallic resources.
Mining royalties have been calculated with rates ranging from 1% to 3% of the value of mineral concentrate or equivalent sold, based on quoted market prices.
In October 2011 changes came into effect for mining companies, with the following features: a Introduction of a Special Mining Tax SMT, levied on mining companies at the stage of exploiting mineral resources.
The additional tax is calculated by applying a progressive scale of rates ranging from 2% to 8.4% of the quarterly operating profit.
b Modification of the mining royalty calculation, which consists of applying a progressive scale of rates ranging from 1% to 12%, of the quarterly operating profit.
The former royalty was calculated on the basis of monthly sales value of mineral concentrates.
The SMT and modified mining royalty are accounted for as an income tax in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes.
c For companies that have mining projects benefiting from tax stability regimes, mining royalties are calculated and recorded as they were previously, applying an additional new special charge on mining that is calculated using progressive scale rates, ranging from 4% to 13.12% of quarterly operating profit.
d In the case of the Arcata mine unit, the company left the tax stability agreement, but has maintained the agreement for the mining royalties, such that the Arcata unit, is liable for the new SMT but the mining royalties remain payable at the same rate as they were, before the modification in 2011.
As at 31 December 2016, the amount payable as under the former mining royalty for the Arcata mining unit, the new mining royalty for the Ares, Pallancata and Inmaculada mining units, and the SMT amounted to US$170,000 2015: US$272,000, US$769,000 2015: US$1,080,000, and US$737,000 2015: US$745,000 respectively.
The former mining royalty is recorded as Trade and other payables, and the new mining royalty and SMT as Income tax payable in the Statement of Financial Position.
The amount recorded in the income statement was US$1,759,000 2015: US$1,205,000 representing the former mining royalty, classified as cost of sales, US$3,882,000 2015: US$1,778,000 of new mining royalty and US$3,869,000 2015: US$755,000 of SMT, both classified as income tax.
Argentina In accordance with Argentinian legislation, Provinces being the legal owners of the mineral resources are entitled to collect royalties from mine operators.
For San Jose, the mining royalty was originally fixed at 1.85% of the pit-head value of the production where the final product is dor and 2.55% where the final product is mineral concentrate or precipitates.
In October 2012 a new provincial law was passed, which increased the mining royalty applicable to dor and concentrate to 3% of the pit-head value.
Since November 2012 Minera Santa Cruz S. A. has been paying and expensing the increased 3% royalty.
As at 31 December 2016, the amount payable as mining royalties amounted to US$509,000 2015: US$524,000.
The amount recorded in the income statement as cost of sales was US$5,747,000 2015: US$4,763,000.
On 13 June 2013, the congress of the Province of Santa Cruz passed Law No.
3318, which created a tax on mining reserves.
Accordingly, the owners of mining concessions located in the Province of Santa Cruz were required to pay a tax on mining reserves at a rate of 1%, calculated at the end of each year and determined according to the international price of metals at that date.
According to these applicable regulations, the tax applied only on proved reserves and certain deductions related to the production cost applied to Minera Santa Cruz S. A. a subsidiary of Hochschild Mining plc.
On 20 December 2013, Minera Santa Cruz S. A. filed before the Argentinian Supreme Court a legal claim against the tax on mining reserves.
Such legal claim challenged the legality of the tax on mining reserves arguing its unconstitutionality on the grounds that it violated the Federal Mining Policy created by national law No.
Additionally, on 2 November 2015, Minera Santa Cruz S. A. filed a precautionary measure under which it requested the Argentinian Supreme Court to order the Province of Santa Cruz not to claim from Minera Santa Cruz S. A. the payment of any amount related to the tax on mining reserves until a final decision on the constitutionality of the tax is rendered.
The precautionary measure was granted on 9 December 2015, with no tax was paid during 2015.
The tax on mining reserves was eliminated on 30 December 2015.
On 1 March 2016 Minera Santa Cruz S. A. and the Province of Santa Cruz entered into an agreement under which each party agreed not to make to the other party any claim related to the tax on mining reserves.
Consequently, the amount payable as at 31 December 2015 as tax on mining reserves of US$4,054,000, which was presented as Trade and other payables, have been written back and credited to the income statement within other income US$2,667,000 and financial income US$974,000 see footnote 2 of note 11.
The expense recognised as other expenses in the year ended 31 December 2015 with respect to this tax amounted to US$441,000 note 12. www.
com 119 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 36 Financial risk management The Group is exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties which may have a financial impact on the Group and which also impact the achievement of social, economic and environmental objectives.
These risks include strategic, commercial, operational and financial risks and are further categorised into risk areas to facilitate consolidated risk reporting across the Group.
The Group has made significant developments in the management of the Groups risk environment which seeks to identify and, where appropriate, implement the controls to mitigate the impact of the Groups significant risks.
This effort is supported by a Risk Committee with the participation of the CEO, the Vice Presidents, and the head of the internal audit function.
The Risk Committee is responsible for implementing the Groups policy on risk management and internal control in support of the Companys business objectives, and monitoring the effectiveness of risk management within the organisation.
a Commodity price risk Silver and gold prices have a material impact on the Groups results of operations.
Prices are significantly affected by changes in global economic conditions and related industry cycles.
Generally, producers of silver and gold are unable to influence prices directly: therefore, the Groups profitability is ensured through the control of its cost base and the efficiency of its operations.
The Groups policy is generally to remain hedge free.
However, management continuously monitors silver and gold prices and reserves the right to take the necessary action, where appropriate and within Board approved parameters, to mitigate the impact of this risk.
For the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 the loss gain recognised in the income statement for the commodity swaps contracts signed during the year is as follows: Effect on Average price Average price income per oz Ag per oz Au statement Year Oz Ag Oz Au US$ US$ US$000 2016 8,999,997 115,000 From 14 to 1,181 18,722 17.60 2015 6,000,000 76,000 17.75 1,229 18,962 The fair value of unsettled commodity forward contracts as at 31 December is as follows: Average price Average price Effect on per oz Ag per oz Au equity Year Oz Ag Oz Au US$ US$ US$000 2016 2015 6,000,000 100,000 15.94 1,151 21,267 At 31 December 2016 the Group is not exposed to commodity price risk on commodity forward contracts.
At 31 December 2015, a 10% favourable or adverse change in the price of gold and silver would have an impact on amounts recognised in the comprehensive income of approximately - US$10,561,000 andUS$8,265,000 respectively.
The Group has embedded derivatives arising from the sale of concentrate and dor which were provisionally priced at the time the sale was recorded refer to notes 5 and 36 e. For these derivatives, the sensitivity of the fair value to an immediate 10% favourable or adverse change in the price of gold and silver assuming all other variables remain constant, is as follows: Increase Effect on decrease in price of profit before tax Year ounces of: US$000 2016 Gold -10% -647 Silver -10% -495 2015 Gold -10% -216 Silver -10% -511 120 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 120 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 Financial statements b Foreign currency risk The Group produces silver and gold which are typically priced in US dollars.
A proportion of the Groups costs are incurred in pounds sterling, Peruvian nuevos soles, Canadian dollars, Argentinian pesos and Mexican pesos.
Accordingly, the Groups financial results may be affected by exchange rate fluctuations between the US dollar and the local currency.
The long-term relationship between commodity prices and currencies in the countries in which the Group operates provides a certain degree of natural protection.
The Group does not use derivative instruments to manage its foreign currency risks.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities, at the reporting date, denominated in their respective currencies, to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax and the Groups equity.

The Group is primarily exposed to credit risk as a result of commercial activities and non-compliance, by counterparties, in transactions in cash which are primarily limited to cash balances deposited in banks and accounts receivable at the statement of financial position date.
Counterparty credit exposure based on commercial activities, including trade receivables, embedded derivatives and cash balances in banks as at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015: % collected As at % collected As at as at 31 December as at 31 December 7 March 2016 6 March 2015 Summary commercial partners US$000 2017 US$000 2016 Trade receivables 36,821 76% 62,352 64% As at As at 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 1 Cash and cash equivalents - Credit rating US$000 US$000 A 40,175 A 64,017 36 A- 8,877 32,846 BBB 65,023 4,059 BBB 1,549 5,158 BBB- 15 NA 513 1,728 Total 139,979 84,017 1 The long-term credit rating as at 31 January 2017 2015: 3 March 2016. www.
com 121 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 36 Financial risk management continued To manage the credit risk associated with commercial activities, the Group took the following steps: Active use of prepayment advance clauses in sales contracts: Delaying delivery of title and or requiring advance payments to reduce exposure timeframe potential delay in sales recognition : Obtaining parent guarantees or contracting directly with the parent company to shore up the credit profile of the customer where possible : and Maintaining as diversified a portfolio of clients as possible.
To manage credit risk associated with cash balances deposited in banks, the Group took the following steps: Increasing banking relationships with large, established and well-capitalised institutions in order to secure access to credit and to diversify credit risk.
Limiting exposure to financial counterparties according to Board approved limits: and Investing cash in short-term, highly liquid and low risk instruments money market accounts, term deposits, US Treasuries.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in notes 20, 22 and 36 e. d Equity risk on financial instruments The Group acquires financial instruments in connection with strategic alliances with third parties.
The Group constantly monitors the fair value of these instruments in order to decide whether or not it is convenient to dispose of these investments.
The disposal decision is also based on managements intention to continue with the strategic alliance, the tax implications and changes in the share price of the investee.
The amount held of investments at year end note 19 is not significant and the sensitivity to reasonable movements in the share price of availablefor-sale financial assets is immaterial.
e Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 31 December 2016 and 2015, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value: 31 December 2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets measured at fair value US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 Equity shares note 19 991 991 Liabilities measured at fair value 1 Embedded derivatives 1,726 1,726 31 December 2015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets measured at fair value US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 Equity shares note 19 366 366 Commodity swaps and zero cost collar agreements note 36 a 21,267 21,267 Liabilities measured at fair value 1 Embedded derivatives 1,141 1,141 1 Sales of concentrate and certain gold and silver volumes are provisionally priced at the time the sale is recorded.
The price is then adjusted after an agreed period of time usually linked to the length of time it takes for the smelter to refine and sell the concentrate or for the refiner to process the dor into gold and silver, with the Group either paying or receiving the difference between the provisional price and the final price.
This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The gain or loss that arises on the fair value of the embedded derivative is recorded in Revenue note 5.
122 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 122 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 Financial statements During the period ending 31 December 2016 and 2015, there were no transfers between these levels.
The reconciliation of the financial instruments categorised as level 3 is as follows: Embedded derivatives liabilities US$000 Balance at 1 January 2015 1,533 Gain from the period recognised in revenue 392 Balance at 31 December 2015 1,141 Gain from the period recognised in revenue 585 Balance at 31 December 2016 1,726 f Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups inability to obtain the funds it requires to comply with its commitments, including the inability to sell a financial asset quickly enough and at a price close to its fair value.
Management constantly monitors the Groups level of shortand medium-term liquidity, and their access to credit lines, in order to ensure appropriate financing is available for its operations.
The table below categorises the undiscounted cash flows of Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period as at the statement of financial position to the contractual maturity date.
Interest cash flows have been calculated using the spot rate at year end.
Changes in interest rates primarily impact loans and borrowings by changing either their fair value fixed rate debt or their future cash flows variable rate debt.
The Group does not have a formal policy of determining how much of its exposure should be at fixed or at variable rates.
However, at the time of taking new loans or borrowings, management applies its judgement to decide whether it believes that a fixed or variable rate borrowing would be more favourable to the Group over the expected period until maturity.
