Unsecured bank overdrafts, other short-term bank borrowings, bank balances and cash, short-term bank deposits and other financial assets approximate to book value due to their short maturities.
For other amounts, the repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at the relevant interest rates applicable at 31 December 2016.
Bonds included within other borrowings have been valued using quoted closing market values.
19 Financial risk management The Groups activities give rise to a number of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Market risk includes foreign currency risk and cash flow and fair value interest rate risk.
The Group has in place risk management policies that seek to limit the effects of financial risk on financial performance.
Derivative financial instruments include: forward foreign currency contracts, which are used to hedge risk exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business: and cross-currency interest rate swaps which hedge cash flows on the Groups debt.
Further information is provided in the treasury management section of the Strategic Report.
Risk management policies have been set by the Board and are implemented by a central Treasury Department that receives regular reports from all the operating companies to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
The Treasury Department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign currency risks, interest rate risk, financial credit risk and liquidity risk and the use of financial instruments to manage these.
GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 151 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2016 19 Financial risk management continued a Foreign currency risk The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries functional currency.
These exposures are forecast on a monthly basis by operating companies and are reported to the central Treasury Department.
Under the Groups foreign currency policy, such exposures are hedged on a reducing percentage basis over a number of forecast time horizons using forward foreign currency contracts.
During the year, the Group designated US dollar and Swedish SEK loans as part of a net investment hedge of US dollar and SEK net assets.
The Group also has a series of cross-currency interest rate swap instruments which in substance convert the 2019 and 2022 sterling bonds into US dollars $951 million and Euros 284 million.
These derivative instruments were also designated as net investment hedges, of US dollar and Euro net assets.
Foreign exchange movements arising from net investment hedging are shown in note 20.
The Groups reporting currency for its consolidated financial statements is sterling.
Changes in exchange rates will affect the translation of results and net assets of operations outside the UK.
The Groups largest exposures are the Euro and the US dollar where a 1% movement in the average rate impacts trading profit of subsidiaries and equity accounted investments by 2 million and 4 million respectively.
Regarding financial instruments, a 1% strengthening of sterling against the currency rates indicated below would have the following impact on operating profit: Trading profit Payables Derivative and financial Intra-group receivables instruments funding m m m Euro 1 6 1 US dollar 1 28 10 The derivative sensitivity analysis has been prepared by reperforming the calculations used to determine the balance sheet values adjusted for the changes in the individual currency rates indicated with all other cross-currency rates remaining constant.
The sensitivity is a fair value change relating to derivatives for which the underlying transaction has not occurred at 31 December 2016.
The Group intends to hold all such derivatives to maturity.
The calculation for other items has been prepared based on an analysis of a currency balance sheet.

The Groups policy is to optimise the interest cost in reported earnings and reduce volatility in the debt related element of the Groups cost of capital.
This policy is achieved by maintaining a target range of fixed and floating rate debt for discrete annual periods, over a defined time horizon.
The Groups normal policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for 50% to 80% of the level of underlying borrowings forecast to arise over a 12-month horizon.
At 31 December 2016, 96% 2015: 93% of the Groups gross borrowings were subject to fixed interest rates.
As at 31 December 2016, 175 million 2015: 72 million was in bank deposits and 5 million was on deposit with banks on the Isle of Man 2015: 5 million.
152 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION c Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments.
In terms of substance, and consistent with the related balance sheet presentation, the Group considers it has two types of credit risk: operational and financial.
Operational credit risk relates to non-performance by customers in respect of trade receivables and by suppliers in respect of other receivables.
Financial credit risk relates to non-performance by banks and similar institutions in respect of cash and deposits, facilities and financial contracts, including forward foreign currency contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps.
Where the Group has an obligation to banks in respect of derivative contracts, its credit risk is taken into account with valuations recorded.
Operational As tier one suppliers to aerospace, automotive and land systems original equipment manufacturers, the Group may have substantial amounts outstanding with a single customer at any one time.
The credit profiles of such original equipment manufacturers are available from credit-rating agencies.
The failure of any such customer to honour its debts could materially affect the Groups results.
However, there are many advantages in these relationships.
In Land Systems, there is a greater proportion of amounts receivable from small and medium-sized customers.
Credit risk and customer relationships are managed at a number of levels within the Group.
At a subsidiary level, documented credit control reviews are required to be held at least every month.
The scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and credit limits.
At a divisional level, debtor ratios, overdue accounts and overall performance are reviewed regularly.
Provisions for doubtful debts are determined at these levels based upon the customers ability to pay and other factors in the Groups relationship with the customer.
At 31 December, the largest five trade receivables as a proportion of total trade receivables analysed by major segment is as follows: 2016 2015 % % GKN Aerospace 65 58 GKN Driveline 60 58 GKN Powder Metallurgy 28 24 GKN Land Systems 24 24 The amount of trade receivables outstanding at the year end does not represent the maximum exposure to operational credit risk due to the normal patterns of supply and payment over the course of a year.
Based on management information collected as at month ends the maximum level of trade receivables at any one point during the year was 1,557 million 2015: 1,240 million.
Financial Credit risk is mitigated by the Groups policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment grade long-term credit rating, normally at least Aor equivalent, and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits is 53 million 2015: 30 million, however, the Group is not exposed to mark-to-market risk for forward foreign currency contracts at 31 December 2016 as all counterparties were in a liability position 2015: nil.
d Capital risk management The Group defines capital as total equity.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a capital structure which optimises the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 153 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2016 19 Financial risk management continued d Capital risk management continued The Groups two external banking covenants require an EBITDA of subsidiaries to net interest payable and receivable ratio of 3.5 times or more and net debt to EBITDA of subsidiaries ratio of 3 times or less measured at 30 June and 31 December.
For the purpose of testing net debt to EBITDA, there is also a requirement to recalculate reported net debt using the Groups average exchange rates, as quoted in the Business Review, over the relevant financial year.
The ratios at 31 December 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 2016 2015 m m EBITDA 1,014 870 Net interest payable and receivable 79 65 EBITDA to net interest payable and receivable ratio 12.8 times 13.4 times 2016 2015 m m Net debt 704 769 EBITDA 1,014 870 Net debt to EBITDA ratio 0.7 times 0.9 times Net debt for the year ended 31 December 2016 using average exchange rates was 626 million 2015: 732 million which results in a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.6 times 2015: 0.8 times.
The Group monitors these ratios on a rolling basis and they are part of the budgeting and forecasting processes.
e Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to liquidity risk as part of its normal financing and trading cycle at times when peak borrowings are required.
Borrowings normally peak in May and September following dividend and bond coupon payments.
The Groups policies are to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet obligations when they fall due and to maintain sufficient flexibility in order to fund investment and acquisition objectives.
Liquidity needs are assessed through shortand long-term forecasts, and committed bank facilities under a revolving credit facility total 800 million which expires in 2019.
There were no drawings on these facilities at 31 December 2016.
In addition, the Groups European Investment Bank unsecured facility 48 million is repayable in three remaining equal annual instalments of 16 million in June 2017 to 2019.
Committed facilities are provided through 14 banks.
The Group also maintains 121 million of uncommitted facilities, provided by five banks.
There were no drawings against these facilities at 31 December 2016.

All of these financial instruments are classified as Level 2 fair value measurements, as defined by IFRS 7, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined with reference to available market information at the balance sheet date, using the methodologies described in their relevant notes: Forward foreign currency contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps and embedded derivatives, see note 20.
Unsecured bank overdrafts, other short-term bank borrowings, bank balances and cash, short-term bank deposits and other financial assets, see note 18.
Bonds included within other borrowings, see note 18.
Fair values of trade and other receivables and payables, short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents are assumed to approximate to cost due to the short-term maturity of the instruments and as the impact of discounting is not significant.
The discounted contingent element of deferred and contingent consideration of 1 million 2015: 2 million is categorised as a Level 3 fair value measurement.
All other financial assets and liabilities together with calculations for fair value less costs of disposal were categorised as Level 2.
