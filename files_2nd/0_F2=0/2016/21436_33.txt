The following describes the UK dened benefit scheme, of which the company is part.
Where separately identiable, thecompanys share of the assets and liabilities and other related pension information are separately identied.
Within the United Kingdom, the group now operates only the one registered dened benefit pension scheme Berendsen DB UK Retirement Benets Scheme formerly known as the Davis Service Group Retirement Benets Scheme, following a merger with the one other smaller scheme on 1 February 2013.
A triennial valuation was carried out at 1 February 2016 and signed off by the Pension Schemes Trustees in December 2016.
As at the triennial date 1 February 2016 the Scheme was fully funded on an ongoing basis so there was no requirement for additional contributions relating to a recovery plan to be paid into the Scheme.
The next valuation is due in February 2019.
The level of benets provided depends on each members length of scheme membership and salary in the final years leading up to retirement.
In the UK plan, the pensions in payment are generally increased by 5% in respect of pre-1 February 1999 membership, and by the retail price index for membership from that date.
benefit payments are made from trustee administered funds.
Plan assets are governed by regulations in the UK, as is the nature of the relationship between the group and the trustees and their composition.
Responsibility for governance of the plan, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies jointly with the company and the trustees.
The trustees must comprise representatives of the company and plan members in accordance with legislation.
At the last valuation date the present value of the dened benefit obligation was comprised of 83 active employees, 1,548 deferred members and 1,339 members in retirement.
Expected contributions by the company, including special contributions, to post employment benefit schemes for the year ended 31 December 2017 are nil 2016: nil.
The weighted average duration of the dened benefit obligation in the UK scheme is 19 years 2015: 17 years.
The actuarial valuation of the UK scheme has been updated as at 31 December 2016 by qualied actuaries using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries were: 2016 2015 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.1 2.8 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.1 2.9 Discount rate 2.7 3.9 Ination rate RPI 3.2 3.0 Ination rate CPI 2.2 2.0 Mortality rate Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice, published statistics and experience in each territory.
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date is as follows: 2016 2015 Male 22.7 23.3 Female 25.2 24.3 The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65, 20 years after the balance sheet date, is as follows: 2016 2015 Male 23.9 23.6 Female 26.8 26.2 193 Berendsen plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Notes to the parent company financial statement continued 8 Pension commitments continued PLC share Scheme Total PLC share Scheme Total as at as at as at as at 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2016 2016 2015 2015 m m m m The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined asfollows: Present value of obligations 189.2 339.3 152.2 272.7 Fair value of plan assets 203.3 334.2 192.4 316.5 Net asset recognised in balance sheet 14.1 5.1 40.2 43.8 The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan assets are as follows: 2016 2015 % % European equities 13 13 North American equities 5 5 Asia Pacic equities 5 5 European bonds 45 45 Other 32 32 100 100 Other assets consist principally of investments in managed multi-asset growth funds.
The company ensures that the investment position is managed within a framework that considers the Schemes liability prole, funding position, expected return of the various asset classes and the need for diversication.
Within this framework, the companys objective is to ensure that sufficiently liquid assets are available to meet benefit payments and the Schemes assets achieve a return that is consistent with the assumptions made by the Trustees in determining the funding of the Scheme.
A large portion of assets in 2016 consists of equities and bonds, although the Scheme also invests in diversied growth funds and a small amount of cash.
The majority of equities are invested in a globally diversied portfolio of international blue chip entities with a target of 35% UK and 65% overseas.
The other growth assets are the diversied growth funds which have a target of 32% of the overall portfolio.
The remainder of the Schemes assets are invested in corporate bonds.
The trustees sought the employers agreement to implement a Liability Driven Investment portfolio.
This will use specialist assets that employ leverage, to match more of the Schemes liabilities, for a given asset value, than a conventional bond.
This portfolio will be implemented when market conditions become more favourable.
The pension surplus is recognised in the balance sheet as the company has the right to any surplus after settlement of all liabilities under the terms of the trust deed.
Sensitivities The sensitivity of the dened benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is set out below for the dened benefit schemes and unfunded schemes.
Dened benefit scheme Impact on scheme liability Increase in Decrease in Change in assumption assumption assumption Discount rate 0.5% 9% 10% Salary growth rate 0.5% 2% 3% Pension growth rate 0.5% no change no change Life expectancy Change by 1 year 4% 4% The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the dened benefit to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position.
