Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiaries are stated at historical cost less impairment provisions for any permanent decrease in value.
The carrying amounts of the Companys investments are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication of impairment.
Ifsuch an indication exists, then the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated.
Losses are recognised in the income statement and reflected in an allowance against the carrying value.
When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.

The declaration and payment of any dividends in the future and the amount of any future dividends will depend on the results of operations, financial conditions, cash requirements, future prospects, profits available for distribution and other factors deemed by the Vectura Board to be relevant at the time.
At present, the Vectura Board does not expect to pay any dividends in the near to medium term.
The Board will continue to re-assess this position based on the factors above.
The Company has approximately 50.8m of profits available for distribution as defined by the Companies Act which will need formal verification at the time of any distribution.
