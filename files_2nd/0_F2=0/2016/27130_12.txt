OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT 35 DEFINITIONS AND RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP MEASURES TO GAAP MEASURES Reference is made to the following non-GAAP measures throughout this Strategic Report.
These measures are shown because the Directors consider they provide useful information to shareholders, including additional insight into ongoing trading and year-on-year comparisons.
These non-GAAP measures should be viewed as complementary to, not replacements for, the comparable GAAP measures.
Headline profit and earnings measures Group headline operating profit is stated before specific adjusting items and amortisation of intangible assets.
Specific adjusting items are excluded on the basis that they distort trading performance.

Earnings before interest, tax and amortisation EBITA is stated before specific adjusting items, amortisation of intangible assets, restructuring costs and other items.
Segment EBITA is stated before unallocated corporate costs.
