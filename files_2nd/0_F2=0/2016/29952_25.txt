The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative financial instruments at fair value through the profit or loss, share-based payments and defined benefit pension obligations.
The financial statements have been rounded to the nearest million in Great British Pounds.
Amounts in pence have been rounded to the nearest tenth of a pence.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial information presented in this document are set out below.
These policies have been applied consistently to the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 3A CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICY AND DISCLOSURE No new standards, amendments or interpretations, effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 October 2015 havehad a material impact on the Group or parent company.
New or amended standard and interpretations in issue but not yet effective or EU endorsed At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective or EU endorsed: IFRS 9 Financial instruments is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018 subject to endorsement by the EU.
IFRS 9 is a replacement for IAS 39 Financial Instruments and covers three distinct areas.
Phase 1 contains new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities.
Phase 2 relates to the impairment of financial assets and requires the calculation of impairment on an expected loss basis rather than the current incurred loss basis.
Phase 3 relates to less stringent requirements for general hedge accounting.
The adoption of IFRS 9 is likely to have a significant impact on the Group in future periods, specifically in relation to the impairment charge recognised on financial asset balances.
The Group is assessing the impact of IFRS 9.
This is expected to impact the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments.
IFRS 15 Revenues from Contracts with Customers is effective for periods commencing 1 January 2018 subject to endorsement by the EU.
IFRS 15 introduces a five-step approach to the timing of revenue recognition based on performance obligations in customer contracts.
The Group is assessing the impact of IFRS 15.
IFRS 16 Leases is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 subject to endorsement by the EU.
IFRS 16 provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for all applicable leases.
The leasing standard is expected to have a material impact on net debt, gross assets, profit from operations and interest.
The Group await the result of ongoing HMRC consultation to understand the impact on taxes.
There are no further IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 111 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of consolidation The Groups financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiaries are all entities including structured entities over which the Group has control.
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Interpretation guidance included within SIC Interpretation 12 Consolidation special purpose entities, indicates that certain special purpose entities SPEs, which are involved in aircraft leasing arrangements with the Group, should be interpreted as being controlled by the Group, and therefore subject to consolidation, even though the Group has no direct or indirect equity interest in those entities.
As a consequence, theGroup has consolidated six 2015: six SPEs that own five 2015: five aircraft operated by the Group on operating leases.
Business combination The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured at fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued, contingent consideration arrangements entered into, and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Directly attributable transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
These values are finalised within 12 months of the date of acquisition.
When the ownership of an acquired company is less than 100%, the non-controlling interest is measured at either the proportion of the recognised net assets attributable to the non-controlling interest or at the fair value of the acquired company at date of acquisition.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Joint venture and associates Entities, other than subsidiaries, over which the Group exerts significant influence, but not control or joint control, are associates.
Entities which the Group jointly controls with one or more other party under a contractual arrangement are joint ventures.
The Groups investments in its associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognised at cost.
The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate or joint venture since the acquisition date.
Goodwill relating to the associate or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment.
Foreign currency The presentation currency of the Group is Sterling.
Average exchange rates are used to translate the results of all subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that have a functional currency other than Sterling.
The balance sheets of such entities are translated at period end exchange rates.
The resulting exchange differences are recorded through a separate component of equity.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of an entity are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities held at the year end are translated at period end exchange rates.
The resulting exchange gain or loss is recorded in Costs of providing tourism services within the Income Statement.
When a foreign entity is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 112 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Intangible assets goodwill Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Groups income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit orlosson disposal.
Intangible assets other Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are carried on the Groups balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Other than capitalised development costs, internally generated intangible assets are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the income statement in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the intangible assets useful life, when finite, as follows: Brands 9 years to indefinite life Customer relationships 1 to 15 years Computer software 3 to 10 years Indefinite-lived intangible assets principally comprise those trademarks for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inflows.
These are considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the level of marketing support.
The nature of the industry we operate in is such that brand obsolescence is not common, if appropriately supported by advertising and marketing spend.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually at the CGU level by comparing their carrying amount to their recoverable amount.
All other intangible assets are assessed at each reporting date for indications of impairment.
If such indications exist, the recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of straight-line depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Where costs are incurred aspart of the start-up or commissioning of an item of property, plant or equipment, and that item is available for use but incapable of operating in the manner intended by Management without such a start-up or commissioning period, then such costs are included within the cost of the item.
Costs that are not directly attributable to bringing an asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by Management are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, upon which no depreciation is provided, is calculated on a straight-line basis and aims to write down their cost to their estimated residual value over their expected useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 40 to 50 years Leasehold properties Shorter of remaining lease period and 40 years Aircraft 23 years or remaining lease period if shorter Aircraft spares 5 to 15 years or remaining lease period if shorter Other fixed assets 3 to 15 years Estimated residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually.
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 113 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Aircraft overhaul and maintenance costs Major overhaul expenditure, including replacement spares and labour costs, is capitalised and amortised over the average expected life between major overhauls.
All other replacement spares and other costs relating to maintenance of fleet assets including maintenance provided under pay-as-you-go contracts are charged to the income statement on consumption or as incurred respectively.
Provision is made for the future costs of major overhauls of operating leased engines, auxiliary power units and airframes by making appropriate charges to the income statement, calculated by reference to hours flown and or the expired lease period, as a consequence ofobligations placed upon the Group under the terms of certain operating leases.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents theestimated selling price less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange and fuel price risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and if so the nature of the item being hedged.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value, on derivatives not designated as a hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Derivatives are presented on the balance sheet on a gross basis.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or anon-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within12 months.
Hedge accounting For fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement as part of finance income or cost line, where they offset the changes in fair value on the hedged item.
Where the hedged item is designated in a fair value hedge relationship of a financial liability held at amortised cost, the change in fair value in respect to the hedged risk is recorded as a fair value adjustment within finance income or cost.
Fair value hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time the changes in fair value on the hedging instrument will continue to be recognised immediately into the income statement, while the hedged item will no longer be adjusted for fair value changes.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value on derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges offuture cash flows is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within net operating expenses.
Forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts and time value of options are not designated as part of the hedging relationship and therefore, are recorded in the income statement within costs of providing tourism.
Changes in fair value deferred through the hedge reserve, are recognised in the income statement in the same period, or periods, in which thehedged highly probable forecast transactions are recognised in the income statement.
Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income are retained until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement for the period.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 114 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Non-derivative financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards relating to the financial asset or when the contractual rights to the cash flows associated with the financial asset expire.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation isdischarged, cancelled or expires.
The measurement of particular financial assets and liabilities is set out below.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, term deposits and investment in money market funds which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less.
Where the Group operates centrally pooled accounts and has the legal right along with the intention and ability to pool account balances, the net cash or overdraft position is disclosed.
Where the intention or ability to pool balances together is absent, the cash and overdraft are disclosed on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheet and the overdraft is excluded from cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method as reduced by allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
An allowance for irrecoverable amounts is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of allowance is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are recognised and subsequently recorded at their fair value.
Gains or losses except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised directly in equity until the financial asset is derecognised.
At this point, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement.
Any impairment losses, foreign exchange gains or losses ordividends receivable are recognised in the income statement.
Held for trading investments Short-term investments and derivatives that are not designated in a hedge relationship such as natural hedges of a balance sheet exposure are classified as held for trading and are recognised and subsequently measured at their fair value.
Gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.
Other non-current asset investments The fair value of investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market are measured using an appropriate valuation technique.
Where a fair value cannot be reliably measured, the investment is measured at cost.
Loans and receivables areinitially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Any impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings Interest bearing borrowings are initially recognised at their fair value net of any directly attributable transaction costs.
They are subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings that are designated as hedged items in a fair value hedge relationship are adjusted for changes in their fair value in respect of the hedged risk.
The adjustment will be amortised to the income statement at the time when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk.
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 115 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Provisions The Group recognises a provision when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources willbe required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are recognised at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is discounted to its present value.
Pensions The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes.
The pension liabilities recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these schemes represent the difference between the present value of the Groups obligations under the schemes calculated using the projected unit credit method and the fair value of those schemes assets.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the period in which they arise within the statement of comprehensive income and expense.
The current service cost, representing benefits accruing over the year, is included in the income statement as a personnel expense.
The unwinding of the discount rate on the scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets are presented as finance costs and finance income respectively.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement in personnel expenses.
Pension costs charged against profits in respect of the Groups defined contribution schemes represent the amount of the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
Share capital Ordinary Shares including share premium are classified as equity.
Leases Leases under which substantially all of the risk and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group are finance leases.
All other leases areoperating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments within property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their expected useful lives.
The interest element of finance lease payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Income arising from operating leases where the Group acts as lessor is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term and included inoperating income due to its operating nature.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share options to certain employees as part of their total remuneration.
The fair values of the share options are calculated at the date of grant, using an appropriate option pricing model.
These fair values are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected vesting period of the options, with a corresponding increase in equity.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as acapital contribution.
The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over thevesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments atthedate at which they are granted.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 116 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Revenue recognition The Groups revenue is measured as the aggregate amount of gross revenue receivable from inclusive tours, airline travel services, hotel services, travel agency commission and other travel services supplied to customers in the ordinary course of business.
The Group records revenue on a net basis after deducting trade discounts, volume rebates, value added tax and compensation vouchers granted to customers.
Revenue relating to travel services arranged by the Groups leisure and airline travel providers, including travel agency commission and other services, are taken to the income statement on the date of holiday and flight departure.
Revenue relating to other services provided by the Group is taken to the income statement as earned.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the significant risks and rewards of ownership is transferred to the customer, usually on delivery of the goods.
Monies received by the balance sheet date relating to holidays commencing and flights departing after the period end are included within current liabilities as revenue received in advance.
Expenses Direct expenses relating to inclusive tours arranged by the Groups leisure travel providers are taken to the income statement on holiday departure or over the period to which they relate as appropriate.
Indirect expenses are recognised in the income statement over the period towhich goods and services are received by the Group.
Separately disclosed items The Group separately discloses in the income statement: non-recurring items, impairment of goodwill and amortisation of business combination intangibles: and IAS 39 fair value remeasurement.
Separately disclosed items, namely items that are material either because of their size or their nature, and which are non-recurring, are presented within their relevant income statement category, but highlighted through separate disclosure.
The separate reporting helps provide a full understanding of the Groups underlying performance.
Items which are included within the separately disclosed category include: profits losses on disposal of assets or businesses and costs of acquisitions: costs of integration of significant acquisitions and other major restructuring programmes: significant goodwill or other asset impairments: material write-down of assets reassessment of accruals, reflecting a more cautious evaluation in light of current trading and economic conditions: and other individually material items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence.
Material business combination intangible assets were acquired as a result of the merger between Thomas Cook AG currently known as Thomas Cook GmbH and MyTravel Group plc and other business combinations made in subsequent years.
The amortisation of these intangible assets is significant and the Groups Management consider that it should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Groups results.
IAS 39 fair value remeasurement includes movements in forward points related to foreign exchange forward contracts and time value of options in cash flow hedging relationships.
Both items are subject to market fluctuations and unwind when the options or forward contracts mature and therefore are not considered to be part of the Groups underlying performance.
Interest income and charges arising on the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and interest charges arising on the unwind of discount on exceptional provisions and contingent consideration are not considered to be part of the Groups underlying performance.
In addition, certain finance costs or income that derive from one off events or transactions are not considered to be part of the Groups underlying performance.
The Groups Management consider that these items should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Groups results.
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 117 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3B SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Finance income and costs Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, expected return on pension plan assets, changes in the fair value of held fortrading interest-related derivatives, and fair value adjustments to hedged items in a designated fair value hedge.
Finance costs comprise interest costs on borrowings and finance leases, unwind of the discount on non-current liabilities, interest cost on pension plan liabilities, changes in the fair value of held for trading interest-related derivatives and changes in fair value of derivatives designated in a fair value hedge relationship.
The changes in fair value on derivatives designated in a fair value hedge relationship and the fair value adjustment on hedged items in a fair value hedge relationship are separately disclosed in Note 7 under the description Finance related charges.
Tax Current tax Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable recoverable in respect of the taxable profit tax loss for a period.
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based ontaxrates and laws that are substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability anditstaxbase, with the following exceptions: Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill, or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting or taxable profit or loss: In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse intheforeseeable future: and Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, tax losses or credits carried forward can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset isrealised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Allocation of tax charge or credit between income statement, other comprehensive income and equity Tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case the associated tax isrecognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity respectively.
Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share EPS data for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
EPS measures for continuing operations have been presented in accordance with IAS 33.
The Group also presents a basic and diluted underlying EPS measure based on underlying profit before tax as defined in separately disclosed items section above.
Further details ofthe EPS calculation are presented in Note 11.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 118 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 3C CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS In applying its accounting policies, the Group has made estimates and assumptions concerning the future, which may differ from the related actual outcomes.
Those estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts ofassets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Revenue recognition A key judgement in recognising revenue is to distinguish where the Groups businesses act in the capacity of principal or agent so to determine the accounting as either gross or net respectively, in line with IAS 18 Revenue Recognition.
The Group exercises judgement to assess principal or agency by considering if it is the prime obligor in all the revenue arrangements, has pricing discretion and is exposed to inventory and credit risk, in which case the Group will be principal to the arrangement.
Residual values of tangible fixed assets Judgements have been made in respect of the residual values and useful economic lives of aircraft included in property, plant and equipment see Note 13.
Those judgements determine the amount of depreciation charged in the income statement.
Impairment of goodwill Judgements have been made in respect of the amounts of future operating cash flows to be generated by certain of the Groups businesses inorder to assess whether there has been any impairment of the amounts included in the balance sheet for goodwill or intangible assets withan indefinite life in relation to those businesses.
Recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments Estimates have been made in respect of the volumes of future trading with hoteliers and the credit-worthiness of those hoteliers in order toassess the recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments made to those hoteliers.
Aircraft maintenance provisions Provisions for the cost of maintaining leased aircraft and spares are based on forecast aircraft utilisation, estimates of future maintenance costs and planned rollover and renewal of the aircraft fleet.
Tax The Group operates in many tax regimes and the tax implications of its operations are complex.
It can take several years for tax liabilities tobeagreed with the relevant authorities.
Tax assets and liabilities represent Managements estimates of tax that will be payable or recoverable in the future and may be dependent on estimates of future profitability.
Where sufficient uncertainty exists with the interpretation of tax law, tax provisions are recognised when it is considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds.
Management uses in-house tax experts, third party advisors and past experience when assessing tax risks.
In addition, estimates have been made in respect of the probable future utilisation of tax losses, and deferred tax assets have been recognised as a result.
The recoverability of these assets is dependent on the agreement of the losses with the relevant authorities and the estimates of future profitability.
Retirement benefits The consolidated financial statements include costs in relation to, and provision for, retirement benefit obligations.
The costs and the present value of any related pension assets and liabilities depend on such factors as life expectancy of the members, the salary progression of current employees, the returns that plan assets generate and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the liabilities.
The Group uses previous experience and impartial actuarial advice to select the values of critical estimates.
The estimates, and the effect of variances in key estimates, are disclosed in Note 30.

Impairment testing is performed by comparing the carrying value of each cash-generating unit CGU to the recoverable amount, determined onthe basis of the CGUs value in use.
The value in use is based on the net present value of future cash flow projections discounted at post-tax rates appropriate for each CGU.
The Groups CGUs are determined by geographical market and consist of: UK, Continental Europe, Northern Europe and Airlines Germany.
The future cash flow projections used to determine the value in use are based on the most recent annual budgets and three-year plans for each of the CGUs.
The key assumptions used to determine the business budget and three-year plans relate to capacity and the pricing of accommodation and fuel inputs.
Capacity is based on Managements view of market demand and the constraints to managing capacity such as aircraft lease commitments.
The accommodation pricing is primarily driven by the underlying bed rate and the foreign exchange hedges in place.
The former is based on the businesses ongoing dialogue with bed suppliers and local cost inflation.
The fuel pricing assumption is primarily driven by the fuel hedges in place and the forward fuel curve at the time that the budget is set.
The key assumptions used to determine the Independent business budget and three-year plans relate to passenger volumes and commission rates, and are based on theindividual businesses view of the market conditions.
Cash flow forecasts for years beyond the three-year plan are extrapolated at an estimated average long-term nominal growth rate of 2%.
A a pre-tax discount rate of between 10.8% 11% reflecting the specific risks of each CGU is used to calculate the value in use for each oftheCGUs.
Sensitivity analysis has not been disclosed as Management believe that any reasonable change in assumptions would not cause the carrying value of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.

No interest is charged on the receivables.
The credit risk in respect of direct receivables from customers is limited as payment is required in full before the services are provided.
In the case of travel services sold by third party agents, the credit risk depends on the creditworthiness of those third parties, but this risk is also limited because of the relatively short period of credit.
Deposits and prepayments include amounts paid in advance to suppliers of hotel and other services in order to guarantee the provision of those supplies.
The Groups current policy is that deposits and prepayments will normally be made for periods of up to two years in advance.
There is a credit risk in respect of the continued operation of those suppliers during those periods.
Deposits and prepayments also include 5m 2015: 36m of deposits on aircraft lease arrangements.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Allowances for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivable balances are managed in the business units where the debts arise and are based on local Management experience.
Factors that are considered include the age of the debt, previous experience with the counterparty and local trading conditions.
Trade receivables arise from individual customers as well as businesses in the travel sector.
The Directors do not consider there to be significant concentration of credit risk relating to trade and other receivables.

The discounted obligation was recognised at the time of the merger and its fair value is subsequently reassessed at each period end as the minority shareholders have the right, after 30 September 2016, to require the Company to acquire their shares, see note 21.
The Cooperative Group and Midlands Co-operative have a put option on their ownership interest and the Group has a similar call option over this interest.

Whilst these facilities have certain financial covenants they are not expected to prevent full utilisation of the facilities if required.
The Group has complied with its covenants throughout the year.
Covenant measures The covenant measures are tested quarterly on a rolling 12 month basis and consist of a leverage covenant and a fixed charge covenant.
The leverage covenant is a measure of pre-exceptional earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and aircraft operating lease rentals compared to net debt.
The fixed charge covenant is a measure of pre-exceptional earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and operating lease charges compared to net interest and operating lease charges.
The leverage and fixed charge covenant hurdles vary depending on the period that they relate to, reflecting the seasonality of the Groups business.

At the date of publication, the Co-operatives had not exercised their Put Options in respect of the JV.
The carrying value reported is the fair value of the consideration calculated at each year end using the Financial Dividend model.
The fair value is the net present value of the Groups forecasted cash outflows arising from final dividend and the contractual exit payment of 4 x EBITDA, discounted at the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The deferred consideration is now fixed and will not vary with EBIT as the period of JV has ended and the cash amount payable will be the minimum per the contract.
The discounted total amount payable at 30 September 2016 is 79m 2015: 73m.
A 1% change in discount rate will result in 1m change in fair value decrease in fair value liability and corresponding gain in profit before tax arising from increase in discount rate.

In addition, the Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate exposures.
The Group enters into interest rate swaps to hedge against interest rate movements in connection with the financing of aircraft and other assets and to hedge against interest rate exposures on fixed rate debt.
The Group also enters into cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate and the currency exposure on foreign currency external borrowings.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency contracts in designated fair valuehedge relationships at 30 September 2016 was an asset of 16m 2015: 11m asset.

In the absence of such an election, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis, however, each party to the master netting agreement or similar agreement will have the option to settle all such amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party.
22 FINANCIAL RISK The Group is subject to risks related to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, fuel prices, liquidity and counterparty credit within the framework of its business operations.
Interest rate risk The Group is subject to risks arising from interest rate movements in connection with the issue of Eurobonds, bank debt, aircraft financing andcash investments.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage these risks and are designated as both cash flow and fair value hedges.
Foreign exchange rate risk The Group has activities in a large number of countries and is therefore subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
These risks arise in connection with the procurement of services in destinations outside the source market.
For example, US Dollar exposure arises on the procurement of fuel and operating supplies for aircraft, as well as investments in aircraft.
The Group requires segments to identify and appropriately hedge all exposures in line with approved treasury policies designed to reflect the commercial risk of each underlying business.
Each segmental hedging policy includes the hedging build up and permitted instruments.
The maximum hedge tenor is 18 months and each segment should achieve at least an 80% hedge ratio prior to the start of the season.
The Group uses currency forwards, currency swaps and currency options to manage transactional currency risks and these are usually designated as cash flow hedges.
The Group does not hedge translation exposures arising from profits generated outside the UK.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 142 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 22 FINANCIAL RISK CONTINUED Fuel price risk Exposure to fuel price risk arises due to flying costs incurred by the Groups aircraft.
The maximum hedge tenor is 24 months and in general each segment should achieve at least an 80% hedge ratio prior to the start of the season.
The Group uses commodity derivative contracts, including fixed price contracts swaps and net purchased options to manage fuel price riskand these are usually designated as cash flow hedges.
The market risks that the Group is subject to have been identified as interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk and fuel price risk.
The impact of reasonably possible changes in these risk variables on the Group, based on the period end holdings of financial instruments have been calculated and are set out in the tables below.
In each case it has been assumed that all other variables remain constant.
As at30 September 2016, the sensitivity of these risks to the defined scenario changes are set out below: Interest rate risk 2016 2015 Impact Impact on profit Impact on profit Impact before tax on equity before tax on equity m m m m 1% 2015: 1% increase in interest rates 8 8 0.25% 2015: 0.25% decrease in interest rates 2 2 Foreign exchange rate risk 2016 2015 Impact Impact on profit Impact on profit Impact before tax on equity before tax on equity m m m m 5% 2015: 5% strengthening of Euro 112 6 28 5% 2015: 5% weakening of Euro 1 11 6 27 5% 2015: 5% strengthening of US Dollar 380 7 77 5% 2015: 5% weakening of US Dollar 2 72 6 74 Fuel price risk 2016 2015 Impact Impact on profit Impact on profit Impact before tax on equity before tax on equity m m m m 10% 2015: 10% increase in fuel price 61 56 10% 2015: 10% decrease in fuel price 61 56 Given recent historical movements in fuel prices management believe a 10% shift is a reasonable possibility.
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 143 22 FINANCIAL RISK CONTINUED Liquidity risk The liquidity position of the Group is significantly influenced by the booking and payment pattern of customers.
As a result, liquidity is at its lowest in the winter months and at its highest in the summer months.
The Group manages the seasonal nature of its liquidity by making use of its bank facility, the terms of which, including the covenant measures, are detailed in the borrowings Note refer to note 19.
The Group also uses liquidity swaps to manage short-term currency positions.
These liquidity swaps are presented as fair value through profit or loss financial instruments.
The undrawn committed debt facility plus the cash available ranged between 586m and 2,212m during the current financial year 2015: 200m 1,682m.
Surplus short-term liquidity is invested in accordance with approved treasury policy.
Financial liabilities are analysed below based on the time between the period end and their contractual maturity.
The amounts shown are estimates of the undiscounted future cash flows and will differ from both carrying value and fair value.

For net settled derivative financial instruments, such as fuel swaps and options, the fair value as at the year end of those instruments in a liability position has been disclosed in the table above.
Trade and other payables include non-financial liabilities of 143m 2015: 142m which have not been analysed above.
Counterparty credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to deposits, outstanding derivatives and trade and other receivables.
The maximum exposure in respect of each of these items at the balance sheet date is the carrying value.
The Group assesses its counterparty credit risk exposure in relation to the investment of surplus cash, fuel contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate hedging contracts and undrawn credit facilities.
The Group primarily uses published credit ratings to assess counterparty strength and to define the credit limit for each counterparty in accordance with approved treasury policies.
The Groups approach to credit risk in respect of trade and other receivables is explained in note 16.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 144 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23 INSURANCE Management of insurance risk Incidental to its main business, the Group, through its subsidiary White Horse Insurance Ireland DAC, issues contracts that transfer significant insurance risk and that are classified as insurance contracts.
As a general guideline, the Group defines as significant insurance riskthe possibility of having to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder.
Business written includes standard commercial risks for the Group and travel insurance for both Group and non-Group customers.
The principal nature of travel insurance risks is one of short-term, low value and high volume.
Underwriting performance is monitored on an ongoing basis and pricing reviewed annually for each individual contract.
Exposure is capped by specific limits within the insurance policy and by using reinsurance contracts for any claims in excess of these retention limits.
Commercial policies have been fully commuted at the year end.
Insurance risk is spread across several European countries where the Group operates including the UK, Ireland and Continental Europe.
When estimating the cost of claims outstanding at the year end, the principal assumption underlying the estimates is the Groups past development pattern.
This includes assumptions in respect of historic claims costs, average claims handling expenses and market developments.
The Group also uses an independent actuary to review its liabilities to ensure that the carrying values are adequate.
Any changes to these variables are not expected to have a material effect on the Group financial statements.
The Group operates a reinsurance policy approved by the White Horse Insurance Ireland DAC Board of Directors which ensures that reinsurers have a financial stability rating of A S&P.
The Group has assessed these credit ratings as being satisfactory in diminishing the Groups exposure to the credit risk of its insurance receivables.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes: 2016 2015 m m Deferred tax assets 228 197 Deferred tax liabilities 51 46 177 151 At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of 3,263m 2015: 2,844m available for offset against future profits.
Deferred tax assets have only been recognised to the extent that the business has forecast future taxable profits against which the assets may be recovered.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses of 2,121m 2015: 1,935m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
2,116m of these losses have no expiry date, with the remaining 4m expiring within 5 years.
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 145 24 DEFERRED TAX CONTINUED Other temporary differences on which deferred tax has been provided primarily relate to the difference in book to tax value on qualifying tax assets, provisions for which tax relief was not originally available, and fair value accounting on assets acquired as part of the merger.
In addition, the Group had unused other temporary differences amounting to 374m 2015: 339m for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Deferred tax liabilities were offset against the corresponding deferred tax assets as appropriate within territories.
Factors affecting the tax charge in future periods In addition to the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% effective from 1 April 2017, a further reduction to 17% effective from 1 April 2020 was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016.
The Groups UK deferred tax asset at 30 September 2016 has been calculated based on the rate at which the temporary difference is expected to reverse.
The Groups future tax charge could be affected by numerous factors, including but not limited to: The UKs proposal to amend the tax rules relating to the utilisation of brought forward losses which would apply from 1 April 2017.
These changes are currently undergoing public consultation and are expected to be enacted as part of the Finance Act 2017.
Any tax reforms in jurisdictions where we have a taxable presence, including any reforms which may arise from the UKs proposed exit from the EU, from the European Commissions proposals for a Common Corporate Tax Base across the EU or any reforms adopted from the OECDs BEPS actions such as those in relation to the deductibility of interest, anti-avoidance or transfer pricing.

The amounts disclosed above represent the Groups contractual exposure.
The Group complies with all the standards relevant to consumer protection and formal requirements in respect of package tour contracts and has all the necessary licences for the various sales markets.
The customers right to reimbursement of the return travel costs and amounts paid in case of insolvency or bankruptcy on the part of the tour operator or travel agency is guaranteed in all Thomas Cook sales markets in line with local legislation and within the various guarantee systems applied.
In the United Kingdom, there is a fund mechanism whereby travel companies are required to collect and remit a small charge for each protected customer upon booking.
Customer rights in relation to Thomas Cook Group in Germany, Belgium and Austria are guaranteed via an insolvency insurance system, in Ireland, Scandinavia and France viaguarantees provided by banks, insurance companies, accredited associations and in the Netherlands via a guaranteed fund.
In the ordinary course of its business, the Group is subject to commercial disputes and litigation including customer claims, employee disputes, taxes and other kinds of lawsuits.
These matters are inherently difficult to quantify.
In appropriate cases, a provision is recognised based on best estimates and Managements judgement but there can be no guarantee that these provisions will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
These are not expected to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 150 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 30 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS Pension schemes for the employees of the Thomas Cook Group consist of defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, with the defined benefit plans being both funded and unfunded.
The obligations arising from defined contribution plans are satisfied by contribution payments to both private and state-run insurance providers.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: 2016 2015 m m Present value of funded obligations 1,442 1,063 Fair value of plan assets 1,470 1,104 Surplus of funded plans 28 41 Present value of unfunded obligations 485 320 Total deficit of defined benefit pension plans 457 279 Unfunded defined benefit pension obligations Unfunded defined benefit pension obligations primarily relate to the Groups employees in the German businesses of Thomas Cook AG and the Condor Group.
Provisions are established on the basis of commitments made to those employees for old-age and transitional pensions based on the legal, tax and economic circumstances of the individual countries and on the period of employment and level of remuneration of the respective employees.
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations totalling 416m 2015: 270m were attributable to the pension commitments of the Condor Group Condor Flugdienst GmbH, Condor Berlin GmbH and CF GmbH.
For employees who joined a Condor Group company prior to 1995, the total pension commitment of the pensions authority of the German federal government and regional states was adjusted and maintained in the form of a company pension scheme.
The flight crews were additionally entitled to a transitional provision for the period between the termination of their in-flight employment and the time they became eligible for a state-run or company pension.
In both cases, the benefit commitment depended on the final salaries of the employees concerned prior to the termination of their in-flight employment final salary plan.
Employees who joined a Condor Group company from 1995 onwards participate in a company pension scheme under which the pension entitlements are based on the average salaries of those employees average salary plan.
The Condor Group also has retirement obligations arising from individual commitments and transitional provisions.
In accordance with IAS 19, all these commitments are classified as unfunded defined benefit obligations and classified as such in these financial statements.
The Condor Group defined benefit plans have been closed to new entrants with the exception of pilots since 2004.
There are additional unfunded defined benefit obligations comprising individual commitments to executive staff at Thomas Cook Group and obligations in respect of past service for employees in the Northern Europe and Continental Europe segments.
The unfunded pension schemes are accounted for as part of liabilities for retirement benefit obligations in the balance sheet.
The following weighted average actuarial assumptions were made for the purpose of determining the unfunded defined benefit obligations: 2016 2015 % % Discount rate for scheme liabilities 1.62% 2.68% Expected rate of salary increases 2.57% 2.56% Future pension increases 1.52% 1.52% The mortality tables 2005 G drawn up by Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck were used, for the German pension schemes, as the basis for the mortality assumptions used in arriving at the present value of the pension obligations at 30 September 2016.
These assume a life expectancy for members currently aged 65 of 19.2 years for men and 23.2 years for women.
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 151 30 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED Changes in the present value of unfunded pension obligations were as follows: 2016 2015 m m At beginning of year 320 329 Current service cost 11 11 Interest cost 8 8 Benefits paid 7 7 Settlements 1 Effect of experience adjustments and demographic assumptions 1 5 Effect of financial assumptions 105 2 Exchange difference 47 17 At end of year 485 320 These amounts have been recognised in the income statement.
Service costs, gains on settlement and curtailment gains have been included in personnel expenses in the income statement and the unwinding of the discount rate of the expected retirement benefit obligations has been included in finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
Funded defined benefit pension obligation The pension entitlements of employees of Thomas Cook UK and employees in Norway and the Netherlands are provided through funded defined benefit schemes, where pension contributions are paid over to the schemes and the assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
These schemes are closed to new entrants and continue to accrue future benefits for existing active members.
The plans are final salary pension plans which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.
The level of benefits provided depends on a members length of service and their salary in the final years of active membership.
In the UK plans, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with retail price index, pensions in deferment are generally updated in line with consumer price index.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries in each country.
The fair value of the pension assets in each scheme at the year end is compared with the present value of the retirement benefit obligations and the net difference reported as a pension asset or retirement benefit obligation as appropriate.
Pension assets are only recognised to the extent that they will result in reimbursements being made or future payments being reduced.
The funded defined benefit obligation primarily relates to the Thomas Cook UK Pension Plan.
The assumptions used in arriving at the present value of the obligations at 30 September 2016 have been updated following the 2014 triennial actuarial funding valuation.
The mortality assumptions used in arriving at the present value of those obligations at 30 September 2016 are based on the S2PA pensioner tables with 2013 CMI projection model with a long term trend rate of 1.5% for males and 1.25% for females.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the plan liabilities indicate a further life expectancy for members currently aged 65 of 23.6 years for men and 25.7 years for women.
The Company and Board of trustees are responsible for governance of the plans and ensuring it is sufficiently funded to meet current and future benefits.
The trustees appoint advisors to carry out the administration actuarial work and investment advice.
Following the 2014 actuarial valuation of the Thomas Cook UK pension plan, the Recovery Plan agreed with the pension trustees to fund the actuarial deficit was extended.
In line with that agreement, during the year ended 30 September 2016 Thomas Cook UK paid instalments totalling 26m in line with the recovery plan.
The valuation of the Thomas Cook UK pension plan at 30 September 2016 resulted in a surplus of 52m 2015: 50m, this is included within the net Group pension deficit of 457m 2015: 279m.
The 52m has been disclosed as a pension asset in the statement of financial position.

The scheme currently has part of its assets invested in a liability driven investment portfolio.
These assets, in combination with the other protection assets in the portfolio, provide interest rate and inflation rate protection.
Sensitivities of the defined benefit obligation The group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: Asset volatility The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields: if plan assets underperform this yield, thiswill create a deficit.
However, the group believes that due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities and the strength of the supporting group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the Groups long term strategy to manage the plans efficiently.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans bond holdings.
Inflation risk Some of the group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation.
The majority of the plans assets are either unaffected by fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated with equities inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy The majority of the plans obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans liabilities.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is: Impact on defined benefit obligation Change in Increase in Decrease in assumption assumption assumption Discount rate for scheme liabilities 0.25% Decrease by 6% Increase by 6% Inflation rate 0.25% Increase by 4% Decrease by 4% Mortality 1 year Increase by 2% The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of the financial position.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 154 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 30 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED The expected future benefit payments are detailed below: Less than a year At 30 September 2016 m Pension benefit payments 38 The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 30 September 2016 is 24.6 years.
Defined contribution schemes There are a number of defined contribution schemes in the Group, the principal scheme being the Thomas Cook UK DC Pension Scheme, which is open to all UK employees.
Cash contributions paid into the defined contribution schemes are accounted for as an income statement expense as they are incurred.
The total charge for the year in respect of this and other defined contribution schemes, including liabilities in respect of insured benefits relating to workers compensation arrangements, amounted to 46m 2015: 23m.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
