3 Remuneration Reportcontinued 3.1 Annual statement by the Remuneration Committee Chairman FY2016 has been a very challenging year for the Company our remuneration outcomes reflect this and are aligned with performance.
Carolyn Hewson Chairman, Remuneration Committee Remuneration outcomes for the CEO Dear Shareholders Overall, Mr Mackenzies actual total remuneration for FY2016 was I am pleased to introduce BHP Billitons Remuneration Report for US$2.241 million, compared with US$4.582 million for FY2015 the financial year to 30 June 2016, and importantly, I would like and US$7.988 million for FY2014.
The relatively lower actual pay to begin by acknowledging the challenging year we have faced.
for FY2016 is aligned with the Companys performance.
The dam failure at Samarco in November 2015 was a profoundly tragic event, with 19 lives lost, and with a significant impact on the In summary, Mr Mackenzie did not receive any performance-related environment and communities.
Alongside this, we saw an ongoing pay in FY2016 short-term and long-term incentives were both decline in commodity markets and the associated negative impact zero.
The reasons for these outcomes are outlined below.
I do want on our performance.
While our operational performance has largely to acknowledge, however, that both the Committee and Board met expectations, the above events and circumstances have had recognised strong performance in several areas, and this is also significant consequences in FY2016, and they are reflected in our set out below.
In relation to the short-term incentive, the dam failure at Samarco Link to strategy a non-operated joint venture in Brazil in November 2015 was a Our BHP Billiton Charter sets out our values, placing health and key consideration, along with the ongoing decline in commodity markets and its associated impact on our performance.
The Board safety first, upon which the Remuneration Committee places great weight in the determination of performance-based remuneration and Committee considered the STI scorecard set for the CEO and outcomes for BHP Billitons executives.
Our Charter also sets his performance against the KPIs, and also weighed up the events out our purpose, our strategy and how we measure success.
and external factors impacting the Groups performance as set out The Committee is guided by those measures in supporting our above.
Having considered all these elements holistically, the Board executives in taking a long-term approach to decision-making and Committee determined that the STI outcome for the CEO in order to build a sustainable and value-adding business.
for FY2016 should be zero and exercised discretion to approve that outcome.
This outcome accorded with an indication the CEO Our approach had previously provided to the Committee that he thought a zero We have made no changes to the underlying approach to STI outcome for FY2016 would be an appropriate alignment of his remuneration in the last year.
It is an approach that BHP Billiton short-term remuneration outcome for FY2016 with the shareholder has practised for over 10 years and we believe it has served our experience and the interests of the Companys other stakeholders.
The remuneration outcomes Without diminishing the significance of Samarco, which has clearly continue to appropriately reflect the performance of the Company, been a key consideration in the determination of the overall zero STI of businesses and of individuals.

There were no to remuneration, with 97 per cent voting for the remuneration fatalities or environment or community incidents during FY2016 at report at last years AGMs, and over 96 per cent support in assets that are operated by BHP Billiton, reflecting a significant effort each of the prior five years.
across the Company that also led to a reduction of 20 per cent in high potential injury events.
While controllable financial performance The exercise of appropriate discretion where the status quo or a formulaic outcome does not align with the overall shareholder was largely in line with targets, the financial impact of Samarco was significant and resulted in the threshold target for underlying experience has been a feature of BHP Billitons approach over many years, for example, reducing the CEOs remuneration package by attributable profit not being achieved.
Capital project management outcomes were largely in line with expectations, and the Committee 25 per cent in 2013, reducing the LTIP award vesting by 35 per cent in 2013, zero STI outcomes for the CEO and Chief Executive also considered the CEOs strong performance against personal objectives.
These include implementing a new simplified Petroleum in 2012 as a result of shale impairments, and the reduction in Chairman and Non-executive Director fees last year.
We will organisation structure following last years demerger of South32, delivering significant further productivity and capital expenditure continue to balance our judgements on remuneration to be fair improvements and implementing the new Inclusion and Diversity to all stakeholders.
Council to accelerate progress in this critical area.
Our remuneration policy is due for its three-yearly re-approval at next years AGMs, and the Committee and Board will take Prior to the decision of the Board and the Committee to exercise discretion to approve a zero STI outcome for the CEO for FY2016 the opportunity over the next 12 months to review our policy to ensure it remains fit-for-purpose and supports the Companys as described above, the Committee considered that the CEOs performance against the original scorecard KPIs would have strategy.
The Committee and Board will continue to incorporate shareholder feedback into our deliberations on Executive and warranted an outcome for FY2016 of 58 per cent of target.

This outcome is again considered appropriate in light of the challenging external environment and the benchmarking data for peer companies.
