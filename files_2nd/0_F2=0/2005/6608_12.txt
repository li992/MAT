The business sectors consist of Pharmaceuticals prescription pharmaceuticals and vaccines and Consumer Healthcare oral care, OTC medicines and nutritional healthcare.
The geographical sectors of the USA, Europe and International other Rest of World markets reflect the Groups most significant regional markets and are consistent with the Groups regional market management reporting structure.
Business sector data includes an allocation of corporate costs to each sector on an appropriate basis.
There are no sales between business sectors.
The Groups activities are organised on a global basis.
The geographical sector figures are therefore influenced by the location of the Groups operating resources, in particular manufacturing and research, and by variations over time in intra-Group trading and funding arrangements.
Turnover is shown by business sector and by location of customer.
Other geographic information is given by location of subsidiary.
The UK segment information gives turnover by location of customer and location of subsidiary.
The UK operating profit, total assets and net assets are also shown.
Where the Group co-promotes a product and the third party records the sale, the Group records its share of revenue as co-promotion income within turnover.
The nature of co-promotion activities is such that the Group records no costs of sales.

Profits arising from certain operations in Singapore, Puerto Rico, Ireland and Belgium are accorded special status and are taxed at reduced rates compared with the normal rates of tax in these territories.
The effect of this reduction in the taxation charge increased earnings per share by 2.7p in 2005, 3.6p in 2004 and 3.9p in 2003.
The Group is required under IFRS to create a deferred tax asset in respect of unrealised intercompany profit arising on stock held by the Group at the year end by applying the tax rate of the country in which the stock is held rather than the tax rate of the country where the profit was originally made and tax paid, which is the practice under UK and US GAAP.
The Group tax rate was increased by 1.0% in 2005 2004 0.3%, 2003 0.4% decrease as a result of reductions in work-in-progress and finished goods.
The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations, involving significant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets, gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
Disagreements with, and between, revenue authorities as to intra-Group transactions, in particular the price at which goods should be transferred between Group companies in different tax jurisdictions, can produce conflicting claims from revenue authorities as to the profits to be taxed in individual territories.
Resolution of such issues is a continuing fact of life for GSK.
The Group has open issues with the revenue authorities in the USA, UK, Japan and Canada: by far the largest relates to Glaxo heritage products, in respect of which the US Internal Revenue Service IRS and HM Revenue & Customs HMRC in the UK have made competing and contradictory claims.
GSK has attempted to settle the US dispute, first through direct discussion with the IRS and subsequently through discussions between the US and UK authorities under the terms of the double tax convention between the two countries: these discussions were terminated in July 2003.
On 6th January 2004 the IRS issued a Notice of Deficiency for the years 1989-1996 claiming additional taxes of $2.7 billion.
On 2nd April 2004 the Group filed a petition in the US Tax Court disputing the IRS claim and seeking a refund of $1 billion in taxes.
On 25th January 2005 the IRS issued a further Notice of Deficiency for the years 1997-2000 claiming additional federal taxes of $1.9 billion, which the Group contested by filing a petition in the US Tax Court on 12th April 2005, to which the IRS filed its statutory Answer on 7th June 2005.
In September 2005 the Court agreed to consolidate the IRS claims for 1997-2000 with those for 1989-1996 into a single trial.
The total claims for these periods amount to $4.6 billion of additional federal taxes and related interest to 31st December 2005 of $3.7 billion, net of federal tax relief, giving a total of $8.3 billion.
The Groups petitions against the IRS claims include counter-claims for repayment of federal taxes totalling $1.8 billion, based partly by reference to an Advance Pricing Agreement APA between SmithKline Beecham and the IRS covering the transfer pricing of Tagamet between 1991 and 1993.
On 23rd December 2004 the IRS filed a motion for summary judgement to exclude any evidence relating to APAs from the court proceedings.
On 31st March 2005 the trial judge denied the IRS motion and reserved ruling on the admissibility of APA evidence until full trial, which is scheduled to commence on 16th October 2006.
As similar tax issues remain open for 2001 to date, GSK expects to receive further substantial claims by the IRS for these years.
GSK continues to believe that the profits reported by its US subsidiaries for the period 1989 to date, on which it has paid taxes in the USA, are more than sufficient to reflect the activities of its US operations.
However, the Group tax creditor balance at 31st December 2005 of 2.3 billion 2004 1.8 billion includes a provision for the estimated amount at which the IRS dispute might ultimately be settled.
If the IRS were to follow the same methodology as applied previously in respect of these later years, GSK estimates that the potential unprovided exposure in respect of this dispute with the IRS for the years 1989-2005 amounted to approximately $11.5 billion at 31st December 2005 2004 $10.1 billion.
GSK is in continuing discussions with HMRC in respect of UK transfer pricing and other matters which are in dispute for the years 1995 to date.
However little progress has been made over the past year and consequently these matters may become subject to litigation in due course.
GSK Annual Report 2005 98 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued 12 Taxation continued GSK uses the best advice in determining its transfer pricing methodology and in seeking to manage transfer pricing issues to a satisfactory conclusion and, on the basis of external professional advice, continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from open assessments.
However, there continues to be a wide difference of views between the Group, the IRS, HMRC and other relevant taxation authorities where open issues exist.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings and negotiations with the relevant tax authorities.
Except as shown in this Annual Report, no provision has been made for taxation which would arise on the distribution of profits retained by overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings, on the grounds that no remittance of profit retained at 31st December 2005 is required in such a way that incremental tax will arise.
The aggregate amount of these unremitted profits at the balance sheet date was approximately 24 billion.
At 31st December 2005 the Group had recognised a deferred tax asset of 87 million 2004 20 million in respect of income tax losses of approximately 291 million 2004 63 million.
Of these losses, 64 million 2004 28 million are due to expire between 20072012, 184 million 2004 19 million are due to expire between 20182025 and 43 million 2004 16 million are available indefinitely.
At 31st December 2005 the Group had not recognised any deferred tax asset in respect of income tax losses of approximately 217 million 2004 387 million, of which 28 million 2004 358 million are due to expire between 20072012, 79 million 2004 nil are due to expire between 20182025 and 110 million 2004 29 million are available indefinitely.
The Group had capital losses at 31st December 2005 estimated to be in excess of 10 billion in respect of which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Deferred tax assets are not recognised where there is insufficient evidence that losses will be utilised.

Included in land and buildings at 31st December 2005 are leased assets with a cost of 165 million 2004 155 million, accumulated amortisation of 49 million 2004 46 million and a net book value of 116 million 2004 109 million.

The impairment losses principally arise from decisions to rationalise facilities and are calculated based on either fair value less costs to sell or value in use.
The value in use calculations determine the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash flows of the relevant asset or cash generating unit, applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8%, adjusted where appropriate for country specific risks.
This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount rate to pre-tax cash flows.
These losses have been charged through Cost of sales, 16 million, Research and development, 2 million, and Selling, general and administration, 13 million.

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually.
Value in use calculations are generally utilised to calculate recoverable amount.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash flows of the cash generating unit in which the goodwill is contained, applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8%, adjusted where appropriate for country specific risks.

The brands are in relatively stable and profitable market sectors, and their size, diversication and market shares mean that the risk of marketrelated factors causing a shortening of the brands lives is considered to be relatively low.
The Group is not aware of any material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factor which could limit their useful lives.
Accordingly, they are not amortised.
Each brand is tested annually for impairment applying a fair value less costs to sell methodology and using five year post-tax cash ow forecasts with a terminal value calculation and applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8%, adjusted where appropriate for country-specic risks.
This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount rate to pre-tax cash ows.
The main assumptions include future sales prices and volumes, product contribution and the future development expenditure required to maintain the products marketability and registration in the relevant jurisdiction and the products life.
These assumptions are reviewed as part of managements budgeting and strategic planning cycle for changes in market conditions and product erosion, through generic competition.

For investments traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by reference to the relevant stock exchange quoted bid price.
For other investments, the fair value is estimated by reference to the current market value of similar instruments or by reference to the discounted cash ows of the underlying net assets.
The Group holds a number of equity investments, frequently in entities where the Group has entered into research collaborations.
Equity investments are recorded as non-current assets unless they are expected to be sold within one year, in which case they are recorded as current assets.
Non-current equity investments include listed investments of 268 million 2004 270 million that offer the Group the opportunity for return through dividend income and fair value gains.
On disposal investments fair value movements are reclassied from reserves to the income statement based on average cost.
The impairment losses recorded in the tables above have been recognised in the income statement for the year within other operating income, together with amounts recycled from the fair value reserve Note 32 on recognition of the impairments.
These impairments initially result from prolonged or significant declines in the fair value of the equity investments below acquisition cost, subsequent to which any further declines in fair value are immediately taken to the income statement.

Provisions are made at the time of sale but the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some time after the initial recognition of the sale.
Because the amounts are estimated they may not fully reect the final outcome and the amounts are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group and product sales mix.
The level of provision is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in the light of historical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made and any changes in arrangements.
Future events could cause the assumptions on which the provisions are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group.

These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benets can be provided by state schemes: by dened contribution schemes, whereby retirement benets are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee, or by dened benefit schemes, whereby retirement benets are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Some hybrid dened benefit schemes also include dened contribution sections.
Contributions to dened benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualied actuaries.
Pension costs of dened benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice, using the projected unit method.
In certain countries pension benets are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies.
Liabilities are generally assessed annually in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years.
The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts or are insured.
Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return.
Investments are diversied to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment.
During 2005, the target asset allocations for the UK schemes were 65% equities and 35% bonds and for the US scheme were 77% equities, 20% bonds and 3% property.
The longer term aim is to increase the property element to 10% with a consequent reduction in equities.
Actuarial movements in the year are recognised in full through the statement of recognised income and expense.
The UK discount rate is based on the iBoxx over 15 year AA index and the US discount rate is based on Moodys Aa index.
The expected return on bonds reects the portfolio mix of index-linked, government and corporate bonds.
An equity risk premium of between 3% and 4% is added to this for equities.
Projected ination rate and pension increases are long term predictions based on the yield gap between long term indexlinked and xed interest Gilts.
In the UK, mortality rates are calculated using the PA92 standard mortality tables projected to 2006.
Plan obligations are then increased by between 3% and 10%, depending on each individual schemes mortality experience, to make allowance for future improvements in life expectancy.
In the USA, mortality rates are calculated using the RP2000 fully generational table, projected using scale AA, with the white collar adjustment.
This builds in a full allowance for future improvements in life expectancy.
During 2005, the Group made special funding contributions to the UK and US pension schemes totalling 366 million.
GSK has agreed with the trustees of the UK and US dened benefit pension schemes that the Group would make additional contributions of approximately 370 million per year over a five-year period ending 31st December 2009 in order to eliminate the deficits on an IAS 19 basis, by that point.
In the UK the dened benefit pension schemes operated for the benefit of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate.
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a dened contribution scheme.
In the USA the former Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham dened benefit schemes were merged during 2001.
In addition, the Group operates a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the USA.
The following information relates to the Groups dened benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare schemes.

These plans are largely completed.
Costs recognised as a provision, principally in respect of identied severances at sites where it has been announced that manufacturing activities will cease and site closure and cleaning costs are expected to be incurred mainly within the next three years.
Costs of asset write-downs have been recognised as impairments of property, plant and equipment.
The Group has recognised costs in previous years in respect of plans for the integration of the Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham businesses.
Implementation of the integration following the merger is substantially complete.
Costs recognised as a provision in respect of identied severances are expected to be incurred in 2006 and in respect of the programme to encourage staff to convert Glaxo Wellcome or SmithKline Beecham share options into GlaxoSmithKline share options when employees exercise these options up to 2010.
The discount on this latter provision increased by 4 million in 2005 2004 4 million, and was calculated using risk-free rates of return.
GlaxoSmithKline is involved in a number of legal and other disputes, including notication of possible claims.
Provisions for legal and other disputes include amounts relating to US anti-trust, product liability, contract terminations, self-insurance, environmental clean-up and property rental.
The companys Directors, having taken legal advice, have established provisions after taking into account insurance and other agreements and having regard to the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter and in accordance with accounting requirements.
These provisions were discounted by 71 million in 2005 2004 11 million using risk-free rates of return.
The effect of the change in the discount rate in 2005 is to increase the discount at 31st December by 20 million.
A number of products have a history of claims made and settlements which makes it possible to use an IBNR incurred but not reported actuarial technique to determine a reasonable estimate of the Groups exposure for unasserted claims in relation to those products.
Apart from the IBNR provision, no provisions have been made for unasserted claims.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations.
It is in the nature of the Groups business that a number of these matters, including those provided using the IBNR actuarial technique, may be the subject of negotiation and litigation over several years.
The largest individual amounts provided are expected to be settled within three years.
At 31st December 2005, it is expected that 115 million 2004 236 million of the provision made for legal and other disputes will be reimbursed.
This amount is included within non-current assets.

The risk being hedged is the variability of cash ows arising from currency uctuations.
Fair value hedges Foreign exchange contracts, designated as fair value hedges, have been entered in order to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with intercompany loans and deposits, commercial paper borrowings and other liabilities.
The Group has designated interest rate swaps and the interest element of cross currency swaps as fair value hedges.
The risk being hedged is the variability of the fair value of the bonds arising from interest rate uctuations.
Net investment hedges Foreign exchange contracts and the currency element of cross currency swaps have been designated as net investment hedges in respect of the foreign currency translation risk arising on consolidation of the Groups net investment in its US dollar, Euro and Yen foreign operations.
2004 UK GAAP disclosures The Group exercised the IFRS 1 exemption to record financial instruments in the comparative period on the existing UK GAAP basis.
The following disclosures are included, as at 31st December 2004 to meet the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures.
UK GAAP accounting policy for derivative financial instruments The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to market risks from treasury operations.
The principal derivative instruments are currency swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
The derivative contracts are treated from inception as an economic hedge of the underlying financial instrument, with matching accounting treatment and cash ows.
The derivative contracts have a high correlation with the specic financial instrument being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedge period.
Derivative instruments no longer designated as hedges are restated at market value and any future changes in value are taken directly to the income statement.
Currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts used to x the value of the related asset or liability in the contract currency and at the contract rate are accrued to the income statement over the life of the contract.
Gains and losses on foreign forward exchange contracts designated as hedges of forecast foreign exchange transactions are deferred and included in the measurement of the related foreign currency transactions in the period they occur.
Gains and losses on balance sheet hedges are accrued and are taken directly to reserves, except that forward premiums discounts are recognised as interest over the life of the contracts.
Interest differentials under interest swap agreements are recognised in the income statement by adjustment of interest expense over the life of the agreement.

Impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39 adoption on comparative information The nature of the main adjustment that would make the comparative information comply with IAS 32 and IAS 39 would be the recognition at fair value of financial instruments classied as fair valued through profit and loss and as available-for-sale.
GSK Annual Report 2005 131 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued 37 Employee share schemes The Group operates share option schemes, whereby options are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADSs in GlaxoSmithKline plc at the grant price, and share award schemes, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADSs in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of specified performance targets.
In 2004, the Group introduced a new share award scheme, the Restricted Share Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADSs in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost after a three year vesting period.
The granting of restricted share awards has replaced the granting of options to certain employees as the cost of the scheme more readily equates to the potential gain to be made by the employee.
The Group operates share option schemes and savings-related share option schemes.
Grants under share option schemes are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Grants of restricted shares and share awards are normally exercisable at the end of the three year vesting performance period.
Grants under savings-related share option schemes are normally exercisable after three years saving.
Options under the share option schemes are normally granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the savings-related share option schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Share options awarded to the Directors and, with effect from the 2004 grant, the CET are subject to performance criteria as laid out in the Remuneration Report.
Option pricing For the purposes of valuing options to arrive at the stock-based compensation charge, the Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
The assumptions used in the model for 2003, 2004 and 2005 are as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Risk-free interest rate 4.0% 4.8% 3.3% 4.6% 4.2% 4.9% Dividend yield 3.0% 3.2% 2.9% Volatility 21% 28% 26% 29% 34% Expected lives of options granted under: Share option schemes 5 years 5 years 5 years Savings-related share option schemes 3 years 3 years 3 years Weighted average share price for grants in the year: Ordinary shares 13.15 11.25 12.66 ADSs $47.42 $43.23 $43.39 Volatility was determined based on the three year share price history.
The fair value of performance share plan grants take into account market conditions.
Expected lives of options were determined based on weighted average historic exercises of options.
The stock-based compensation charge has been recorded in the income statement as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Cost of sales 17 35 42 Selling, general and administration 150 207 224 Research and development 69 91 109 236 333 375 Share option Share option Savings-related Options outstanding schemes shares schemes ADSs share option schemes Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted Number exercise fair Number exercise fair Number exercise fair 000 price value 000 price value 000 price value At 1st January 2003 197,472 15.20 90,877 $47.34 12,988 10.29 Options granted 32,750 12.88 3.13 23,630 $43.36 $10.92 1,416 10.20 4.15 Options exercised 4,728 7.92 1,828 $24.33 112 10.23 Options cancelled 19,789 16.48 6,150 $52.65 3,709 12.23 At 31st December 2003 205,705 14.89 106,529 $46.58 10,583 9.59 Options granted 9,837 11.23 2.49 9,222 $42.99 $8.54 1,580 9.52 3.30 Options exercised 5,764 6.54 1,845 $25.65 232 9.18 Options cancelled 11,997 15.33 3,427 $48.28 1,790 10.46 At 31st December 2004 197,781 14.92 110,479 $46.57 10,141 9.44 Options granted 516 12.57 2.76 956 $45.66 $9.90 5,167 11.45 3.68 Options exercised 10,483 9.91 7,537 $38.83 5,732 9.16 Options cancelled 20,888 17.16 8,306 $50.26 810 11.02 At 31st December 2005 166,926 14.97 95,592 $46.86 8,766 10.66 Range of exercise prices 5.61 19.77 $22.32 $61.35 9.16 11.45 The average share price in 2005 was 13.42 and $48.88 GSK Annual Report 2005 132 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued 37 Employee share schemes continued In order to encourage employees to convert options, excluding savings-related share options, held over Glaxo Wellcome or SmithKline Beecham shares or ADSs, into those over GlaxoSmithKline shares or ADSs, a programme was established to give an additional cash benefit of 10% of the exercise price of the original option provided that the employee did not voluntarily leave the Group for two years from the date of the merger and did not exercise the option before the earlier of six months from the expiry date of the original option and two years from the date of the merger.
The cash benefit will also be paid if the options expire unexercised if the market price is below the exercise price on the date of expiry.
There has been no change in the effective exercise price of any outstanding options during the year.

The percentage of each award that vests is based upon the performance of the Group over a three year measurement period.
The performance conditions consist of two parts, each of which applies to 50% of the award.
For awards granted in 2003, the first part of the condition compares GlaxoSmithKlines Total Shareholder Return TSR over the period with the TSR of companies in the UK FTSE 100 Index over the same period.
For awards granted in 2004, and subsequent years, the first part of the condition compares GlaxoSmithKlines TSR over the period with the TSR of 13 pharmaceutical companies in the comparator group over the same period.
The second part of the performance condition compares GlaxoSmithKlines earnings per share growth to the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the three year performance period.
Awards granted to Directors and members of the CET from 15th December 2003 are subject to a single performance condition which compares GlaxoSmithKlines TSR over the period with the TSR of companies in the comparator group over the same period.

On implementation of SFAS amortisation ceased in accordance with IFRS 3 Business 142 in 2002, intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives were combinations.
The Group must instead identify and value its reporting no longer amortised.
As a result of the difference in accounting units for the purpose of assessing, at least annually, potential treatment prior to the implementation of SFAS 142, the carrying impairment of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit.

This has been valued on the same basis as the other intangible assets acquired and relates to various development projects in the preapproval stage where the technological feasibility of the projects had not been established at the point of acquisition.
c Theravance In May 2004, the Group formed a strategic alliance with Theravance Inc. to develop and commercialise novel medicines across a variety of important therapeutic areas.
Under the terms of the alliance, Theravance received $129 million, a significant part of which related to the Groups purchase of Theravance shares.
The Group has a call option in 2007 to further increase its ownership to over 50% at a significant premium to the price paid in the 2004 transaction.
Theravances shareholders have a put option at a lower exercise price to cause GlaxoSmithKline to acquire up to half of their outstanding stock in 2007.
The Group has an exclusive option to license potential new medicines from all of Theravances programmes until August 2007.
Upon exercising its option over a Theravance programme, the Group will be responsible for the relevant development, manufacturing and commercialisation activities.
Depending on the success of such programmes, Theravance will receive clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalties on the subsequent sales of medicines.
Based on the assessment performed, the Group was the primary beneciary of Theravance, as dened by FIN 46R, and as a result Theravance has been consolidated into the Groups US GAAP financial statements from May 2004.
The net assets acquired were measured at fair value.
The principal adjustment to the carrying value of the net assets in Theravances balance sheet prior to the acquisition was recognition of in-process research and development IPR&D at a valuation of 273 million.
The IPR&D was written off immediately after the acquisition in accordance with US GAAP purchase accounting.
The effect of consolidating Theravance, including reversal of fair value gains recorded for the investment under IFRS, has been to decrease shareholders equity by 10 million 2004 60 million and net income by 16 million 2004 60 million.
Additionally, the Group has accounted for the Theravance put option discussed above in accordance with SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, which requires the Group to record the fair value of the put option as a liability.
The fair value of the Theravance put option at 31st December 2005 is 47 million 2004 69 million.
In accordance with SFAS 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities the call option is not recognised in the financial statements as it is not readily convertible into cash.

GSK Annual Report 2005 149 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued 40 Transition to IFRS IFRS adjustments A summary of the principal differences between UK GAAP and IFRS Background as they apply to GSK is set out below and the financial effect is shown The IFRS project on pages 153 to 156.
In June 2002, the Council of the European Union adopted a Customer allowances Regulation requiring listed companies in its Member States to prepare This adjustment is a reclassification between turnover and expenses their consolidated financial statements in accordance with with no profit or cash flow effect.

Valuations are inherently unpredictable and changes in the fair values of financial instruments could have a material impact on the future results and financial position of GSK.
GSK Annual Report 2005 150 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued Pensions and other post-employment benefits 40 Transition to IFRS continued GlaxoSmithKline accounted under UK GAAP for pensions and other IFRS adjustments post-employment benefits OPEBs in accordance with SSAP 24, which The share-based payments charge reduced to a more normal level of spread the costs of providing the benefits over the estimated average 236 million in 2005.
The considerably higher charge in 2004 and service lives of the employees.
2003 arises from two main factors.
Relatively few share options were granted during 2000 when the GW SB merger was being finalised, IAS 19, Employee Benefits, recognises surpluses and deficits in the but then in 2001 there was a full catch-up grant early in the year accounts, and in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, followed by the normal annual grant in November 2001.
In addition, the surpluses and deficits have been recognised in full on the balance the grants in 2001 were made at an average share price in excess of sheet at the transition date of 1st January 2003.
These share options became exercisable in 2004 and therefore an amendment to IAS 19 issued by the IASB in December 2004, it is fell out of the charge in 2005, which now reflects more current share permitted to recognise any movements in the surpluses or deficits prices and more normal grant levels.

This means that, Coreg capitalisation and amortisation in most cases, the balance sheet reflects the full surplus or deficit The North American rights to Coreg were acquired at the time of the positions of the funds.
GW SB merger as partial consideration for the required disposal of The Groups policy is to charge out to the operating businesses the Kytril to Roche.
Under UK GAAP this was accounted for as an service cost element of the pension charge, which then gets reported exchange of assets with no value being attributed to Coreg on the within cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenditure or balance sheet.
IFRS, however, requires the acquired rights to Coreg to research and development as appropriate, but not to charge out the be added to intangible assets at their fair value on the date of element related to the funding deficit, which is all reported in selling, acquisition of $400 million, and then amortised over their remaining general and administrative expenditure.

additional reclassification adjustment between the income statement Other intangible assets amortisation expense headings.
Under UK GAAP, GSK amortised intangible assets over their estimated expected useful lives from acquisition, which was up to a maximum The overall impact of the adjustments to pensions and OPEBs in 2004 of 15 years.
IFRS only permits amortisation to commence when the was a decrease in profit before tax of 36 million 2003 increase of asset becomes available for use, with annual impairment testing 11 million and a decrease in EPS of 0.4 pence 2003 nil.
GSK has determined that the point at which Share of profits of associates amortisation of product-related assets commences under IFRS will Under UK GAAP the share of profits of associates was reported within normally be regulatory approval.
The majority of the Groups profit before tax for the Group.
However, IFRS requires this share of intangible assets relates to the acquisition of rights to compounds in profits to be the net profit attributable to the Group, i. e. after interest, development and so has not reached the point at which amortisation tax and minority interests of the associate.
This has led to a commences.
This has led to a reduction in the amortisation charge, reclassification adjustment removing the share of the associates which is likely to reverse in the future as these compounds reach interest, tax and minority interests from those lines in the income regulatory approval and amortisation is then charged over a shorter statement and netting them all together in the share of profits of period.
Profit before tax in 2004 increased by 43 million 2003 43 associates line.
This adjustment reduced 2004 profit before tax by million and EPS by 0.5 pence 2003 0.5 pence.

Under IFRS, however, goodwill is considered to rate.
IFRS, however, takes a balance sheet approach to the recognition have an indefinite life and so is not amortised, but is subject to annual of deferred tax which results in the tax rate of the company holding impairment testing.
This adjustment therefore reverses the goodwill the inventory at the balance sheet date being applied to the provision.

GSK Annual Report 2005 151 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued Amortisation of goodwill under UK GAAP prior to the date of 40 Transition to IFRS continued transition to IFRS, 1st January 2003, has not been reversed.
Other adjustments Accordingly, goodwill recognised on the IFRS balance sheet is lower There are a number of other minor adjustments and reclassifications, in this respect than it would have been if GSK had not taken including: advantage of the business combinations exemption Computer software, which is recorded as an intangible asset unless Share-based payments: IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, applies to it forms an integral part of the operating system of a tangible fixed equity instruments, such as share options granted since 7th asset November 2002, but GlaxoSmithKline has elected to adopt full Deferred tax on brands acquired with a company, where if there is retrospective application of the standard a difference between the fair value of the brands on acquisition and Financial instruments: Financial instruments in the comparative the tax value, a taxable temporary difference arises periods presented in the Annual Report 2005 i. e. 2004 and 2003 are recognised and measured on the UK GAAP basis applicable in Cash equivalents reclassification, where liquid investments with those years, rather than in accordance with IAS 39 Financial maturities of less than three months at acquisition are included Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

Also, available-for-sale financial assets such as liabilities.
equity investments and liquid investments are recorded at cost less impairments rather than at fair value.
Cash flow statement The move from UK GAAP to IFRS does not change any of the cash flows of the Group.
The IFRS cash flow format is similar to UK GAAP but presents various cash flows in different categories and in a different order from the UK GAAP cash flow statement.
All of the IFRS accounting adjustments net out within cash generated from operations except for the intangible assets reclassification and the inclusion of liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months on acquisition, together with related exchange adjustments, within cash and cash equivalents under IFRS.
IFRS 1 exemptions and elections IFRS 1, First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, permits those companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take some exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS in the transition period or to make elections to apply IFRS with full retrospective effect where not required to do so.
GSK has adopted the following key exemptions and elections: Business combinations: Business combinations prior to the transition date 1st January 2003 have not been restated onto an IFRS basis.
If the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham in 2000 had been restated onto an IFRS basis it would have been accounted for as an acquisition.
Fair value adjustments to the net assets of the acquired company would have been required, including the recognition of significant intangible asset balances for product rights relating to both marketed products and in-process R&D, which were not recognised under merger accounting.
A significant goodwill balance would also have been recorded Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998 under old UK GAAP is not written back to goodwill.
If the business combinations exemption had not been taken, additional goodwill balances relating to acquisitions prior to 1998 would have been recognised on the IFRS balance sheet GSK Annual Report

Environmental matters GSK has been notified of its potential responsibility relating to past operations and its past waste disposal practices at certain sites, primarily in the USA.
Some of these matters are the subject of litigation, including proceedings initiated by the US federal or state governments for waste disposal site remediation costs and tort actions brought by private parties.
GSK has been advised that it may be a responsible party at approximately 28 sites, of which 14 appear on the National Priority List created by the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act Superfund.
These proceedings seek to require the operators of hazardous waste facilities, transporters of waste to the sites and generators of hazardous waste disposed of at the sites to clean up the sites or to reimburse the government for cleanup costs.
In most instances, GSK is involved as an alleged generator of hazardous waste although there are a few sites where GSK is involved as a current or former operator of the facility.
Although Superfund provides that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for cleanup costs, these proceedings are frequently resolved on the basis of the nature and quantity of waste disposed of at the site by the generator.
GSKs proportionate liability for cleanup costs has been substantially determined for about 20 of the sites referred to above.
GSKs potential liability varies greatly from site to site.
While the cost of investigation, study and remediation at such sites could, over time, be substantial, GSK routinely accrues amounts related to its share of the liability for such matters.
Tax matters Pending tax matters, including disclosure of the tax liability of 2.3 billion 2004 1.8 billion, are described in Note 12, Taxation.
