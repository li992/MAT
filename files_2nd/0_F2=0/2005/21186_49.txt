Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 142 Financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28 Equity compensation plans a Description of the plans The Group maintains a number of active stock option and award schemes.
These are as follows: i Savings-related options These are options granted under the Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn SAYE share option schemes in the United Kingdom and in Ireland.
Options are normally exercisable during the six-month period following either the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the relevant savings contract.
ii Executive share options These are options granted on various dates from 1996 to 2004, under the Aviva Executive Share Option Scheme or predecessor schemes.
The exercise of options granted before 1997 is not subject to performance conditions.
Options granted between 1997 and 2000 were subject to the satisfaction of conditions relating to either the Companys return on capital employed ROCE or its relative total shareholder return TSR against a chosen comparator group.
In respect of options granted from 2000 the performance condition has been a mixture of both ROCE and TSR measures.
In all cases, performance is measured over a three-year performance period and the options are normally exerciable between the third and tenth anniversary of their grant.
iii Deferred bonus plan options These are options granted in 1999 and 2000 under the CGU Deferred Bonus Plan.
Participants who deferred their annual cash bonus in exchange for an award of shares of equal value also received a matching award over an equal number of share options.
The exercise of these options is not subject to the attainment of performance conditions.
These options are exercisable up to the tenth anniversary of their grant.
iv Long-term incentive plan awards These awards have been made to senior Group executives since 2001 and are described in section b below and on pages 66 and 67. v Deferred bonus plan awards These awards have been made under the Aviva Deferred Bonus Plan, and are described in section b below and on page 74.
The Group has established various employee share trusts to facilitate the delivery of shares under the above schemes.

Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 144 Financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28 Equity compensation plans continued iii Shares to satisfy awards and options Prior to March 2003, it was the practice to satisfy awards and options granted under the executive incentive plans through shares purchased in the market and held by an employee share trust which was established for the purpose of satisfying awards under the various executive incentive plans and funded by the Company.
From March 2003, no shares have been purchased by the trust, it being the Companys current practice to satisfy the awards granted after that date by the issue of new shares at the time of vesting.
At 31 December 2005, 1,823,788 shares were held by the employee share trust with an aggregate nominal value of 455,947 and market value of 12.8 million.
The trustees have waived their right to dividends on the shares held in this trust.

The bonds chosen were those with a similar remaining term to the expected life of the options.
No options were exercised during the year 2004: nil.
