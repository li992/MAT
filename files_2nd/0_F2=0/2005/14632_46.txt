A R 2005 17 3 06 01:1 pm Page 59 29 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Pension plans - The Group The Group is accounting for pension costs in accordance with International Accounting Standard 19.
The disclosures shown here are in respect of the Groups Defined Benefit Obligations.
Other plans operated by the Group were either Defined Contribution plans or were deemed immaterial for the purposes of IAS 19 reporting.
The total expense relating to the Groups Defined Contribution pension plans in the current year was 2,636,000 2004 2,396,000.
Of the Defined Benefit plans, the plans in the UK and USA hold most of the liability.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions in respect of these plans may therefore be considered material.
The UK schemes assume that post-retirement mortality follows the PMA80C00 table with a two year setback.
The figures disclosed assume that a male member will survive 18 years from age 65 and a female member for 22 years.
These figures reflect a detailed review of recent mortality experience amongst the membership carried out by the Actuary at the last valuation of the UK schemes.
The USA schemes use the 1979 George B. Buck mortality table.
These assumptions will be regularly reviewed in light of scheme specific experience and more widely available statistics.

Awards are determined by the Remuneration Committee whose objective is to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders by giving an incentive linked to added shareholder value.
Options are subject to performance conditions, which if met make the options exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
For options granted from 1995 to 2001 the performance condition is an increase in EPS of more than 6% greater than the increase in the UK retail prices index over a consecutive three year period between grant and exercise.
From and including the 2002 options the increase in EPS was revised to 9% greater than the increase in the UK retail price index over a three year consecutive period and from 2005 the performance condition needs to be met over the three year period from 1st January prior to the date of the grant.
If the condition is not met at the end of the three year period the option will lapse.
Under the transitional requirements of IFRS 2 all awards made after 7th November 2002 need to be subject to the recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2.
Applying IFRS 2 to earlier awards is optional, but we have chosen to adopt IFRS 2 from 1st July 2001 to give greater clarity and comparability between accounting periods.
The share options granted during 2005 have been measured by Watson Wyatt LLP, Actuaries and Consultants, using the Present Economic Value PEV valuation methodology.
The relevant disclosures in respect of the 2005 share option scheme grants and for the other grants made after 1st July 2001 are set out below.
b Performance Share Plan Following shareholder approval of the Performance Share Plan at the annual general meeting on 12th May 2005 awards over shares were made to executive directors.
Awards under the Performance Share Plan take the form of contingent rights to acquire shares, subject to the satisfaction of a performance target.
To the extent that they vest, awards may be satisfied in cash or in shares.
"The performance target in 2005 is based on the Company's total shareholder return ""TSR"" relative to the TSR of other companies included in the FTSE All-Share Engineering and Machinery Sector over a three year performance period where awards will vest on a sliding scale."
All shares within an award will vest if the Company's TSR is at or above the upper quartile.
25% will vest if the TSR is at the median and the number of shares that will vest will be calculated pro-rata on a straight line basis between 25% and 100% if the Company's TSR falls between the median and the upper quartile.
No shares will vest if the Company's TSR is below the median.

The aim of the Plan is to encourage increased shareholding in the Company by all UK employees and so there are no performance conditions.
Employees are invited to join the Plan when an offer is made each year.
Individuals save for 12 months during the accumulation period and subscribe for shares at the lower of the price at the beginning and the end of the accumulation period under Inland Revenue rules.
The Company provides a matching share for each share purchased by the individual.
