The principal schemes are in the United Kingdom and in the United States and are of the defined benefit type, with assets held in separate trustee-administered funds.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The Group accounts for its pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, principally post-retirement healthcare, in accordance with FRS17 Retirement Benefits.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the two principal UK schemes were performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2003 and 5 April 2003.
The most recent valuations of the principal US pension and post-retirement healthcare plans were performed at 1 January 2005.
These valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries for the purposes of FRS17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 July 2005.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at 31 July 2005.
Contributions to these schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries with the objective that the benefits be fully funded during the scheme members average working lives.
The Group provides a defined contribution 401K plan for its US employees.
The disclosures relate to all defined benefit retirement plans in the United Kingdom and the United States.
Defined benefit plans in other territories, most of which are unfunded, have net pension liabilities of 20.0m 2004: 14.2m.
No additional disclosure is given in respect of these plans on grounds of their immateriality.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below: 2005 2004 2003 UK US UK US UK US Rate of increase in salaries 3.4% 3.75% 3.6% 3.75% 4.2% 4.0% Rate of increase in pensions 2.5% n a 2.8% n a 2.8% n a Discount rate 5.0% 5.50% 5.7% 6.25% 5.5% 6.5% Inflation rate 2.4% 2.75% 2.6% 2.75% 2.7% 3.0% Healthcare cost increases 5.0% 5.0% 5.0% 9% p. a. reducing 1% p. a. to 5% p. a. in 2010 10% p. a. reducing 1% p. a. to 5% p. a. in 2010 10% p. a. reducing 1% p. a. to 5% p. a. in 2009 The mortality assumptions used in the UK schemes are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members within each scheme and the assumptions also allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member who retires in 2013 at age 65 will live on average for a further 19 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 22 years after retirement if they are female.

21 Financial instruments a Fair values of financial assets and liabilities Set out below is a year-end comparison of the book value and current fair value of the Companys financial instruments by category.
Fair values of interest rate swaps, currency swap and forward currency contracts are based on the market prices of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than the currency risk disclosures.
Where market prices are not available, the fair value has been calculated by discounting cash-flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
The fair value of the preference shares for which no quoted price exists is based on the application of earnings multiples of companies in similar industries which have quoted market prices.

Currency rate swaps protect the Group from translation exposure in line with its policy as set out on page 27 of the Operating and Financial Review and interest rate swaps are used to ensure that the Groups debt is broadly evenly split between fixed and floating rate funds.

As previously reported, John Crane, Inc. John Crane, a subsidiary of the Company, is one of many co-defendants in numerous law suits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from exposure to, or use of, products containing asbestos.
The John Crane products generally referred to in these cases are ones in which the asbestos fibres were encapsulated in such a manner that, according to tests conducted on behalf of John Crane, the products were safe.
John Crane ceased manufacturing products containing asbestos in 1985.
John Crane has resisted every case in which it has been named and will continue its robust defence of all asbestos-related claims based upon this safe product defence.
In addition John Crane has access to insurance cover which, while it is kept under review, is judged sufficient to meet all material costs of defending these claims for the foreseeable future.
As a result of its defence policy, John Crane has been dismissed before trial from cases involving approximately 113,000 claims over the last 26 years.
John Crane is currently a defendant in cases involving approximately 174,000 claims.
Despite these large numbers of claims, John Crane has had final judgments against it, after appeals, in only 46 cases, amounting to awards of some US$39m over the 26-year period.
These awards, the related interest and all material defence costs have been met in full by insurance.
No provision relating to litigation has been made in these accounts other than as disclosed in note 23.
