Financial instruments disclosure for the year ended 31 December 2005 as required by FRS 25 Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risk arises in the normal course of the Company's business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge certain transaction exposures to foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Credit risk The credit risk on derivative financial instruments is very limited as the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by independent international credit rating companies.
Interest rate risk Hedging In line with the Group policy of ensuring that at least 50% of its exposure to changes in interest rates on fixed term borrowings is hedged, at 31 December 2005, the Company had entered into two interest rate cap and collar transactions.
The cap on both financial instruments is a US dollar LIBOR rate of 4.75% and the collars are 4.19% and 3.96% respectively.
Both instruments mature over the next five years consistent with the maturity of the related $250 million loan.
At 31 December 2005 the Group had interest rate hedges with a notional contract amount of $187,500,000 2004: $nil.
The Company classifies interest rate hedges as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value at 31 December 2005 was 864,000 2004: nil comprising a financial asset 864,000.
This amount was recognised as a non-trade receivable in other current assets.
Foreign currency risk The Company incurs foreign currency risk on intercompany transactions that are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The currency primarily giving rise to this risk is the US dollar.
From time to time the Company enters into forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
When financing material asset purchases or acquisitions the Group's policy is to create a natural hedge as far as possible in respect of any borrowings used for such purposes.
In respect of the American Cystoscope Makers Inc ACMI acquisition, the Company applied this policy by raising the loan facility in US dollars, being the principal currency of the assets acquired and the trade of ACMI.
Gyrus Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2005 85 NOTES TO THE COMPANY ONLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED The Company designates its forward foreign exchange contracts of the variabilty of cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of firm commitments and forecasted transactions at 31 December 2005 was nil.
At 31 December 2005, the Company had no obligations to sell currency.
Adjustments to the fair value of cash flow hedges are reported in equity when designated as effective hedges.
The ineffective portion is immediately recognised in the profit and loss account.
Otherwise the gains and losses will be reported in the profit and loss account only when the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognised in the profit and loss account.
A summary of the impact of cash flow hedges on equity and on the profit and loss account is disclosed below: Gains 2005 000 Adjustments reported in equity Fair value adjustments of effective cash flow hedges 864 At 31 December 2005 864 Adjustments reported in the profit and loss account Ineffective portion of cash flow hedges charged to the profit and loss account 1,980 Effect on profit and loss account of cash flow hedges 1,980 Note b on the face of the consolidated income statement sets out the circumstances of this non-recurring hedging gain.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Company aims to reduce the impact of short term volatility on the Group's earnings through transaction exposures.
The Company does not hedge its exposure to fluctuations in earnings based upon translation of foreign currency assets and liabilites.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on earnings.
The $250 million loan and $30 million revolver facilities attract interest based on US dollar LIBOR.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the Company's profit before taxation by approximately 601,000.
Interest rate hedges have been included in this calculation.
