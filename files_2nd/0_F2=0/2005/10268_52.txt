ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the Company will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 Related Parties and has therefore not disclosed transactions with Group entities.
Accounting convention and basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom UK GAAP.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 from presenting its own pro t and loss account.
The pro t after tax included in the accounts of Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc, determined in accordance with the Act, was 21.6m 2004: 29.0m.
Under Financial Reporting Standard No 1 revised, the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash ow statement as its cash ows are included within the published consolidated statement of cash ows of Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained within FRS 8 and has not therefore disclosed transactions or balances with entities which form part of its Group.
Prior year adjustments and changes in accounting policy The Company adopted the following new Financial Reporting Standards in 2005: FRS 20: Share-based payment FRS 20 requires that the fair value of share options granted is recognised as an expense or, if relating to the employees of subsidiaries, a capital contribution to subsidiaries, with a corresponding increase in equity in both cases.
Previously, only the intrinsic value of share options issued at a discount was recognised as an expense.
During the current and prior year, the Company only issued share options to the employees of its operating subsidiaries.
Consequently, FRS 20 has not impacted the financial statements.
FRS 21: Events after the balance sheet date FRS 21 requires dividends to be recorded as liabilities in the period in which they are authorised and approved.
Previously, proposed dividends were recorded as liabilities in the period, notwithstanding they were declared and approved after the balance sheet date.
This change in accounting policy has resulted in dividends proposed in February 2005 and recorded in the balance sheet at 31 December 2004 only being recognised during 2005.
The impact of this restatement is to increase net assets at 31 December 2004 by 29.8m and increase dividend distribution made in 2005 by the same amount.
FRS 25: Financial instruments disclosure and presentation The Company has adopted, with effect from 1 January 2005, the disclosure and presentation requirements of FRS 25: Financial instruments disclosure and presentation.
Comparative financial information has not been restated.
FRS 26: Financial instruments measurement The Company has adopted, with effect from 1 January 2005, the measurement requirements of FRS 26: Financial instruments measurement.
103 MILLENNIUM & COPTHORNE HOTELS plc NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued Investments In the Companys accounts, investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the Companys pro t and loss account.
Cash and liquid resources Cash, for the purpose of the cash ow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the pro t for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Except as otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for all timing differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences arise when items on income and expenditure are included in tax computations in periods different from their inclusion in the financial statements.
Foreign exchange Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The Company uses a fair value hedging model to designate bank loans and bonds held in overseas currencies as hedging instruments against designated overseas investments held in the same currency.
Under such fair value hedges, both the hedged item and the hedging instrument are retranslated with the exchange differences in both cases being recorded in the pro t and loss account as they arise at each period end.
Dividend distribution Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved for payment.
