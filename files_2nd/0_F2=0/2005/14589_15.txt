The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises both current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of intra-group dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.

The last such derivative financial instrument expired on 31 December 2005 and the group has no current intention of using average rate options as a hedging instrument in future.
The group manages its transactional exposures to foreign currency risks through the use of forward exchange contracts.
Forward exchange contracts are typically used to hedge highly probable forecast sale transactions which can be forecast to occur from anything between 1 and 18 months into the future.
The groups translational exposures to foreign currency risks can relate both to the income statement and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
Following the expiry of the last zero cost average rate option on 31 December 2005, the groups policy is not to hedge the translational exposure that arises on consolidation of the income statements of overseas subsidiaries.
The group finances overseas company investments partly through the use of foreign currency borrowings in order to provide a natural hedge of foreign currency risk arising on translation of the groups net investment.

In February 2006 Spectris entered into an option agreement to sell the Arcom business to Eurotech S. p. A.
Since the year end, Eurotech has paid US$2m to Spectris in consideration for the option which gives Eurotech 60 days to acquire Arcom on a cash and debtfree basis.
Should the acquisition complete, the total consideration will be US$26m including the US$2m option payment already received.
As at 31 December 2005, the assets and liabilities of the Arcom business are presented in the group accounts as held for sale and are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
There was no gain or loss arising as a result of the classification as held for sale.

In addition, six overseas subsidiaries provide defined benefit plans.
Other UK and overseas subsidiaries have their own defined contribution plans invested in independent funds, and the group operates a defined contribution plan in the USA for its US subsidiaries.
Defined contribution plans The total cost to Spectris plc of the defined contribution plans for the year ended 31 December 2005 was 6.9m 2004: 6.3m.
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions to these plans as at 31 December 2005 or at 31 December 2004.
Defined benefit plans The last full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates: Plan name Date of last full actuarial valuation Spectris Pension Plan 31 December 2002 Servomex Pension and Assurance Scheme 30 June 2002 Brel & Kjr Vibro GmbH 31 December 2005 Hottinger Baldwin Messtechnik GmbH 31 December 2005 Spectris GmbH Sensoren und Systeme 31 December 2005 BTG Mtek GmbH 31 December 2005 Brel & Kjr GmbH 31 December 2005 PANalytical GmbH 31 December 2005 The valuations were updated to 31 December 2005 for IAS 19 purposes by qualified independent actuaries.
The total contributions made to the defined benefit plans in the year ended 31 December 2005 were 3.2m 2004: 1.5m.
Contributions for 2006 are expected to be as follows: Plan name Expected 2006 contributions m Spectris Pension Plan 2.5 Servomex Pension and Assurance Scheme Brel & Kjr Vibro GmbH Hottinger Baldwin Messtechnik GmbH 0.2 Spectris GmbH Sensoren und Systeme 0.1 BTG Mtek GmbH Brel & Kjr GmbH PANalytical GmbH The above contribution rates are subject to review at future valuations and periodical certifications of the Schedule of Contributions.
The assets and liabilities of the Servomex Pension and Assurance Scheme were transferred to the Spectris Pension Plan on 31 December 2005 and this is reflected in the above contribution rates.
The Spectris Pension Plan is a closed scheme and hence under the Projected Unit Method, used to calculate the service cost under IAS 19, the current service cost will increase when expressed as a percentage of pensionable pay as the members of the plan approach retirement.
The major assumptions used by the actuary to value the liabilities of the defined benefit plans were: 2005 2004 UK plans % pa % pa Discount rate 4.80 5.30 Salary increases 4.40 4.40 Pension increases in payment 2.90 for LPI 2.90 for LPI Pension increases in deferment 2.90 2.90 Inflation assumption 2.90 2.90 LPI is Limited Price Indexation Mortality rate assumptions: Pensioner life expectancy assumed in the 31 December 2005 update is based on the following tables: Current pensioners pxa92 mortality tables projected to calendar year 2005 Future pensioners pxa92 mortality tables projected to calendar year 2020 Samples of the ages which pensioners are assumed to live to are as follows: Male Female Pensioner aged 65 in 2005 83.7 86.6 Pensioner aged 65 in 2020 85.0 87.9 Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2005 45 SPECTRIS 32-76 3 4 06 9:18 pm Page 46 Notes to the accounts continued 9 Retirement benefit schemes continued 2005 2004 German plans % pa % pa Discount rate 4.25 4.75 Salary increases 2.50 2.50 Pension increases in payment 1.50 1.75 Pension increases in deferment Inflation assumption 2.50 2.50 Mortality rate assumptions: Pensioner life expectancy assumed in the 31 December 2005 update is based on the following tables: Current pensioners and future pensioners Dr K Heubeck pension tables 2005 G Samples of the ages which pensioners are assumed to live to are as follows: Male Female Pensioner aged 60 in 2005 82.0 86.7 Pensioner aged 60 in 2020 84.3 88.8 Different rates of pension increases apply to some members of the Spectris Pension Plan and the Servomex Pension and Assurance Scheme: the liabilities have been valued at the appropriate rates.
The interest cost and expected return on scheme assets are both recognised in finance costs in the income statement.
Actuarial losses are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
During the year insurance premiums for death-in-service benefits were paid amounting to 0.3m 2004: 0.2m.
The actual return on scheme assets was 9.9m 2004: 4.8m.
The expected return on equities is the sum of inflation, dividend yield and economic growth, less investment expenses.
The return on gilts and bonds is the current market yield on long-term gilts and bonds.
The expected return on other assets is the current interest rate set by the Bank of England.

In 2002, the group disposed of 80.1% of its interest in Luxtron Corporation in exchange for US$6m 5% preference shares and continued to hold its 19.9% equity interest.
The groups preference shares and equity interest were deemed to be impaired and have since been carried in the group balance sheet at a nil value.
During 2005, 0.4m of preference shares were redeemed and the group has disposed of its remaining interest in Luxtron for a further 1.3m, generating a gain on disposal of 1.7m.
This gain is presented as financial income in the income statement.
In addition the group has received dividend income amounting to 0.1m 2004: 0.1m.

The legality of the UK rules is currently being challenged and the group litigation order test case has been referred to the European Court of Justice.
In view of the uncertainties regarding the final outcome of the court proceedings and taking into account current UK tax law, a liability has been recognised.
In the event that current UK law is overturned, no tax will be due.
Taxation on other dividend flows of 3.6m 2004: 0.9m is mitigated by movements on unrecognised deferred tax assets of 1.4m 2004: 0.9m and current year UK tax losses of 1.9m 2004: nil.

13 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year but adjusted for the effects of dilutive options.
The key features of share option contracts are described in Note 28 to these accounts.

Secured bank loan Bank loans are secured by fixed charges over property at three of the groups subsidiaries.
Of these 1.7m is denominated in Chinese Renminbi and is repayable by instalments until December 2012 with a fixed interest rate of 7.5%, 0.8m is denominated in US dollars and is repayable by instalments until December 2014 with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus a small margin, and 0.7m is denominated in euros and is repayable by instalments until December 2012 with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus a small margin.
Unsecured loan notes In 1996 the group issued US$100m of loan notes repayable on 15 July 2006 at par.
The loan notes bear interest at an average rate of 7.72%, which is fixed until redemption.
In 1996 the group entered into treasury locks to underwrite the interest rate at which the loan notes were issued.
This produced net proceeds of US$1.4m.
These proceeds are amortised over the period of the loan notes in the income statement.
After taking these proceeds into account, the average net rate of interest on the loan notes is 7.5%.
In September 2000 the group issued US$75m of loan notes repayable on 13 September 2010 at par.
The interest rate on these notes is 8.23%.
On issue, the group entered into cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements which have the effect of converting the US$ borrowings into fixed interest euro-denominated debt.
The combined effect of the borrowing and swap arrangement results in euro debt of 80.4m with a fixed interest rate of 6.89%.
The interest rate is fixed until redemption of the loan notes.
In October 2003 the group issued 25m of loan notes repayable on 15 October 2013.
The interest rate on these notes is 5.56% and remains fixed until redemption.
In October 2003 the group issued US$100m of loan notes repayable on 15 October 2013.
The interest rate on these notes is 6.08%.
The combined effect of the borrowing and swap arrangement results in euro debt of 90.5m with a fixed interest rate of 5.64%.
The interest rate remains fixed until redemption.
Interest is paid six-monthly in arrears on all loan notes.
Under IFRS, in the case of both the September 2000 and October 2003 US$ borrowing arrangements, the value of the underlying US$ borrowing is presented in this borrowings note and the value of the related cross-currency interest rate swaps is presented separately within derivative financial instruments in Note 21.
For management purposes, the value attributed to the portion of the swap arrangements that converts US$ borrowings into euro borrowings is viewed as part of the groups net debt, as analysed below.

In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, First Time Adoption of IFRS, the group has applied the exemption permitting the group not to adopt the standards in the comparative period ended 31 December 2004 and therefore these standards have been applied prospectively from 1 January 2005.
From a presentational perspective, the 2004 comparatives are stated in accordance with the UK GAAP standard FRS 13, Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments.
The nature of the changes arising from the changes in accounting policy are described further below.
Forward exchange contracts The group utilises forward exchange contracts to hedge the potential variability in cash flow arising from highly probable forecast sale transactions due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Until 31 December 2004 under UK GAAP, the value of these instruments was not recognised until the hedged transactions took place.
Following adoption of IAS 39 as at 1 January 2005, these contracts are recorded at each balance sheet date at their fair value on the balance sheet.
Assuming the hedge is effective, any change in the fair value of the forward exchange contracts is recognised in the hedging reserve in equity until the point at which the hedged transaction occurs, at which time any amount recognised in the hedging reserve is recycled through the income statement.
Any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship is recognised in the income statement immediately.
As at 1 January 2005, following the change in accounting policy described, an asset of 0.8m was recognised in the balance sheet, with a corresponding entry in the hedging reserve.
Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2005 55 SPECTRIS 32-76 3 4 06 9:18 pm Page 56 Notes to the accounts continued 21 Derivative financial instruments continued The fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding as at 31 December 2005 is a liability of 0.6m of which 0.5m has been debited to the hedging reserve and 0.1m debited to the income statement.
These contracts mature over periods not exceeding 12 months.
A summary of the movements in the hedging reserve during the year is presented below.
2005 Analysis of movements in hedging reserve m At 1 January 2005 0.8 Amounts recognised in equity during the year 0.5 Amounts removed from equity and included in income statement during the year 0.8 At 31 December 2005 0.5 The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on readily available market data.
Cross-currency interest rate swaps As described in Note 20, the group has taken out cross-currency interest rate swaps to effectively convert fixed interest US$ borrowings into fixed interest euro borrowings.
These synthetic euro borrowings act as a natural hedge of the net assets of the groups European businesses.
The value of the groups cross-currency interest rate swaps can effectively be split into two components: a portion that is attributable to converting a US$-denominated borrowing liability into a euro-denominated borrowing liability the currency portion the value of this portion changes as currency exchange rates change: and a portion that is attributable to converting fixed rate US$ interest payments into fixed rate euro interest payments the interest portion the value of this portion of the swap changes as US$ variable interest rates, euro variable interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates change.
Until 31 December 2004 under UK GAAP, the combined instruments were accounted for as if they were straightforward fixed interest euro borrowings and were designated as a hedge of the groups net investment in its European businesses.
The effect of this accounting policy was that the currency portion of the swaps was effectively recognised within the carrying value of borrowings on the balance sheet and the interest portion of the swap was not recognised on the balance sheet.
Any exchange gain or loss on retranslation of the borrowings was recognised in equity.
The fair value of the entire cross-currency swap was disclosed in the accounts.
From adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, the underlying US$ borrowings are required to be presented separately in the balance sheet from the crosscurrency interest rate swaps.
In addition, the fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is required to be recognised in full on the balance sheet.
Following adoption of IAS 39 as at 1 January 2005, the previous UK GAAP carrying value of the affected 2000 and 2003 unsecured loan note borrowings underlying US$ borrowings and currency portion of the swap of 120.5m was replaced with the underlying US$ borrowings of 90.6m and total liability value of the cross-currency interest rate swap of 37.5m.
The net effect of this change was to reduce net assets by 7.6m with a corresponding entry in reserves.
At 31 December 2005, the fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swap is a liability of 24.7m.
The reduction in value is primarily attributable to the strengthening of the US$ during the year.
The table below shows the movements on the total value of the cross-currency interest rate swap during the year and also how it is attributed to its currency and interest portions.
Currency Interest Total portion portion value Fair value of cross-currency interest rate swap m m m At 1 January 2005 29.9 7.6 37.5 Change in fair value recognised in reserves 13.9 13.9 Change in fair value recognised in income statement 1.1 1.1 At 31 December 2005 16.0 8.7 24.7 The combination of the underlying US$ borrowings and cross-currency interest rate swap has been designated as a net investment hedge of the groups net investment in its European businesses.
However the interest portion of the swap is ineffective in this hedging relationship.
Accordingly, the change in value of the currency portion of the swap is recognised together with the change in value of the underlying US$ borrowings in reserves, and the change in value of the interest portion of the swap is recognised in the income statement within financing costs.
The fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps is determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on readily available market data.
The key terms of the cross-currency interest rate swaps are set out below.
The principal borrowing amounts match exactly with the related unsecured loan note borrowings as described in Note 20.
Principal amount Date taken out Maturity date swap rate $ swap rate $75m 13 September 2000 13 September 2010 6.89% 8.23% $100m 15 October 2003 15 October 2013 5.64% 6.08% 56 Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2005 SPECTRIS 32-76 3 4 06 9:18 pm Page 57 21 Derivative financial instruments continued Average rate options Historically the group has used zero cost average rate options to manage, to a greater or lesser extent, both transactional and translational foreign currency exposures.
Until 31 December 2004 under UK GAAP, the value of these instruments was recognised in the period they were intended to cover as a hedge.
Following adoption of IAS 39 from 1 January 2005, the fair value of these instruments is required to be recognised on the balance sheet.
Since these instruments do not meet IAS 39s hedge accounting criteria, any change in the fair value of the instruments is recognised in the income statement.
As at 1 January 2005, following the change in accounting policy described, an asset of 1.7m was recognised on the balance sheet, with a corresponding entry in reserves.
At 31 December 2005, all outstanding instruments expired with a nil value.
The change in fair value during the year ended 31 December 2005 of 1.7m has been recognised in the income statement within financing costs.

Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included within the groups standard terms and conditions.
Warranty commitments typically apply for a 12-month period, with the occasional extension up to 36 months.
The provision represents the directors best estimate of the groups liability based on past experience.
Other provisions represent the directors best estimate of settling various potential claims against the group arising in the ordinary course of business.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain pending the outcome of ongoing negotiations.

No deferred tax liabilities have been provided in respect of the unremitted earnings of non-UK subsidiaries.
The amount of such unremitted earnings is estimated to be a retained profit of 353m 2004: 351m.
Deferred tax assets estimated at 4.2m 2004: 10.7m have not been recognised due to the degree of uncertainty over both the amount and utilisation of the underlying tax losses and deductions in certain jurisdictions.
There is no associated expiry date with the unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period are shown below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

The retained earnings reserve includes own shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust see Note 29.
The nature and purpose of other reserves forming part of equity are as follows: Translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, including gains or losses arising on net investment hedges.
Hedging reserve This reserve records the fair value of forward exchange contracts where they are designated in effective cash flow hedge relationships.
Merger reserve This reserve arose on the acquisition of Servomex Limited in 1999, a purchase satisfied substantially by the issue of share capital and therefore eligible for merger relief under the provisions of section 131 of the Companies Act 1985.
Capital redemption reserve This reserve records the historical repurchase of the groups own shares.

Under the Executive Share Option Scheme, exercise prices are determined according to the mid-market closing share price prevailing on the day before the date of grant.
Share options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme are also subject to performance criteria, being the fulfilment of earnings growth targets.
Options vest after a period of three years, and have a maximum term of ten years.
Under the Save As You Earn scheme, equity shares are issued following a vesting period of three years.
Options may be exercised during a six-month period following the vesting date, and exercise prices are determined according to the mid-market closing share price prevailing on the day before the date of grant.
There are no performance criteria associated with options granted under the Save As You Earn scheme.
No performance conditions were included in the calculation of fair value.
For options granted in 2005 and 2004, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: Executive Share SAYE Option Scheme 11111111111 11111111111 2005 2004 2005 2004 Weighted average share price pence 553 408 588 416 Weighted average exercise price pence 589 408 589 436 Expected volatility 31.1% 31.1% 36.6% 38.5% Expected life 3.25 yrs 3.25 yrs 6.0 yrs 6.0 yrs Risk-free rate 4.2% 4.7% 4.1% 4.6% Expected dividends expressed as a yield 2.7% 3.3% 2.5% 3.1% Fair value per option 19.6% 23.2% 31.9% 28.9% The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last 6 years.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The group recognised total expenses of 0.3m related to equity settled share-based payment transactions in 2005 2004: 0.4m.

The purchase of the shares on the open market is funded by loans directly from Spectris plc.
Dividend income in excess of 0.01p per share on the shares held by the EBT has been waived by the Trust and is therefore not included in the groups income statement.
Interest and administration costs of the EBT are charged to the profit and loss account of the company for the year.
