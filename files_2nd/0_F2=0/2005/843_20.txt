Notes to the company balance sheet 1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain land and buildings and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and the Companies Act 1985.
In the year the company has adopted FRS 17 Retirement benefits, FRS 20 Share-based payment, FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date, FRS 23 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, the presentation requirements of FRS 25 Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation, FRS 26 Financial instruments: measurement, and FRS 28 Corresponding amounts.
With the exception of the adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26 see financial instruments accounting policy below changes in accounting policy have been accounted for as a prior period adjustment, and the company balance sheet as at 31 December 2004 has been restated as detailed in note 13.
The company has not adopted the amendments to FRS 26 and FRS 12 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which will apply for the year commencing on 1 January 2006.
Where the company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the group, the company considers these to be indemnity arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect the company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The company does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the accounts for the period commencing 1 January 2006.
The company has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided on all tangible assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write-off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold land and buildings the shorter of the lease term or 50 years Plant and equipment mainly three to five years Financial instruments Under the transitional provisions of FRS 26 AMEC has elected not to adopt FRS 25 and FRS 26 in its restated financial information for the year ended 31 December 2004 and, as a result, FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments disclosures has been applied in accounting for financial instruments in the year ended 31 December 2004.
On 1 January 2005, AMEC adopted FRS 25 and FRS 26 and adopted the following policy in accounting for financial instruments.
Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value.
Subsequent valuation depends on the designation of the instruments.
Cash, deposits and short-term investments are held at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for as described in note 1 to the consolidated accounts.
The company is exempt from the disclosure requirements of FRS 25 as the financial instruments disclosures of IAS 32 are included in the notes to the consolidated accounts.
Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign currency net investments and foreign currency borrowings, or forward exchange contracts used to hedge those investments, are taken directly to reserves.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account in the year.
Interest Interest is written-off to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Leases Operating lease costs are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Pensions Contributions to defined benefit pension schemes in respect of employees of AMEC plc are charged in the profit and loss account as incurred.
Defined benefit pension schemes are operated by the group but the company is unable to separately identify its share of the assets and liabilities of those schemes or any details of the surplus or deficit in the scheme and the implications of that surplus or deficit for the company.
Details of the disclosures required under FRS 17 can be found in the accounts of AMEC Group Limited, a subsidiary company.
AMEC plc annual report 2005 105 Notes to the company balance sheet continued 1 Accounting policies continued Share option schemes The fair value of equity instruments granted to employees of the company is charged to the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date, using an appropriate valuation model and spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the award.
The charge is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares or options that vest, except where failure to vest is due to a market based criteria.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
