The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities are calculated by reference to market prices wherever these are available and otherwise by discounting future cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
The above analysis includes store finance leases held in the Groups US operations with a capitalised value of nil 2004: 212 million.
It is not considered practical to estimate the fair value of these financial liabilities as no appropriate external benchmark is available.
They are therefore included in the above analysis at book value.
Financial assets After taking into account various interest rate and currency swaps the interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets was: Financial Floating Fixed assets on rate rate which no financial financial interest Total assets assets is paid m m m m Sterling Retail 580 573 7 Sterling Sainsburys Bank 1,553 211 1,342 US Dollar 8 8 Other 44 At 26 March 2005 2,145 796 1,349 Sterling Retail 1,123 1,116 7 Sterling Sainsburys Bank 1,490 320 1,170 US Dollar 58 56 2 Other 1 At 27 March 2004 2,671 1,492 1,177 2 1 Restated for change in classification of Sainsburys Banks assets, liabilities and cash see note 1.

Floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank overdrafts linked to bank base rates and money market loans, commercial paper, bank borrowings, currency swaps of nil 2004: 698 million and interest rate swaps bearing interest rates linked to LIBOR.
The financial liabilities on which no interest is paid do not have predetermined dates of payment and therefore a weighted average period of maturity cannot be calculated.
Onerous leases are considered to be a floating rate financial liability as, in establishing the provision, the cash flows have been discounted.
The discount rate is reappraised at each half yearly reporting date to ensure that it reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The above analysis excludes a cancellable swap in a notional principal amount of 150 million under which the Company pays a fixed rate of 4.09 per cent and receives floating rate LIBOR.
The counterparty may exercise an option to cancel the swap on quarterly dates through to August 2030.
Currency exposures After taking into account forward contracts the Group had net euro denominated monetary assets of 36 million 2004: 25 million, US dollar denominated monetary assets of 33 million 2004: 25 million and Australian dollar monetary assets of 1 million 2004: 2 million.
The Group has net euro denominated trade creditors of 8 million 2004: 6 million, Australian dollar denominated trade creditors of 1 million 2004: nil and US dollar denominated receivables of nil 2004: 1 million.
Excluded from the comparative figures are non-sterling borrowings undertaken by the Company to hedge investments in overseas operations.
Sainsburys Bank is not exposed to currency risk at this time and does not have any assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than sterling so no currency risk arises.

Sainsburys Banks exposure to movements in interest rates is shown in the following table which discloses the interest rate repricing profile of assets and liabilities as at 26 March 2005.
Any asset or positive gap position reflects the fact that the Banks financial assets reprice more quickly, or in greater proportion than liabilities in a given time period and will tend to benefit net interest rate income in a rising interest rate environment.
A liability or negative gap exists when liabilities reprice more quickly or in greater proportion than assets during a given period and tends to benefit net interest income in a declining rate environment.
Items are allocated to time bands by reference to the earlier of the next contractual interest rate repricing date and the maturity date.

Shareholders were given the option of receiving an initial dividend payment of 35 pence for each B share held or redeeming the B shares immediately or in the future at 35 pence per share.
The future redemption dates are 18 January and 18 July each year until 18 July 2007.
Total capital returned to shareholders by 26 March 2005 amounted to 659 million, of which 112 million was by way of initial dividend payment and 547 million was through share redemption.
The B shares which received the initial dividend were subsequently converted to deferred shares.
The deferred shares were redeemed at the close of business on 13 May 2005 for a total consideration of one pence and were cancelled.
There remains a further 62 million B shares valued at 21 million to be redeemed at a future date.
These shareholders will receive a preference dividend of 75 per cent of the 6 month LIBOR, until their redemption which is fixed at 35 pence per B share.
The current preference dividend rate is 3.67 per cent 75 per cent of 4.89 per cent.
B shareholders have no voting rights except in a resolution for the winding up of the Company.
On winding up, the B shareholders are entitled to 35 pence per B share and the relevant proportion of the dividends outstanding.
Once all the shares have been redeemed, distributable reserves will have decreased by 680 million in respect of the return of capital and 2 million in respect of share redemption costs.
In addition to the initial dividend of 112 million paid on 20 July 2004, 1 million was paid on 18 January 2005 in respect of a preference dividend on outstanding B shares.
These dividends are shown as non-equity dividends in the profit and loss account for the year and as part of returns on investments and servicing of finance in the cash flow statement.
The redemptions are shown in financing in the cash flow statement and a transfer has been made from the profit and loss account to capital redemption reserves of 547 million.
In addition to the return of capital, there was also a consolidation of Sainsburys shares whereby for every eight existing ordinary shares 4 of 25 pence each held at the close of business on 16 July 2004, shareholders received seven new ordinary shares of 28 pence each.
As a 7 result of this, the number of ordinary shares in issue was reduced by 243 million.
As at 26 March 2005, the total number of ordinary shares in issue was 1,702 million.

This is an approved Inland Revenue Scheme and was established in 1980.
At 26 March 2005, UK employees held 25,625 five-year savings contracts in respect of options over 20.1 million shares and 24,985 three-year savings contracts in respect of options over 13.1 million shares.
In 2003, the J Sainsbury plc Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST existed to acquire shares for UK employees, including Directors, in satisfaction of their options under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
The QUEST was liquidated in the prior financial year as the Company now issues shares directly to UK employees under the terms of the Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
During the year 363,244 shares were allotted under this plan for a total consideration of 1 million.

All participants remaining in the Companys employment or leaving for certain reasons, are entitled to receive a grant of options after a period of three years to purchase the shares awarded to them for the sum of 1, at any time during the 10 years following the date of grant.
The participants entitlement to receive the grant depends on the Companys total shareholder return TSR, compared with a peer group of companies, over the three-year performance period.
If the appropriate level of TSR is not achieved, the entitlement to receive the grant of options will lapse.
The Group now recognises the market value of shares issued under the Long Term Performance Share Plan as a charge to the profit and loss account, spread over the performance period to which the awards relate.
24,336,858 shares 2004: 24,336,858 are held by an ESOP trust for the Executive Share Option Plan note 27.
There is no charge to the profit and loss account because the options are granted at market value.

31 Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions The Group purchased two companies during the year for a total consideration of 101 million.
Jacksons Stores Ltd, a chain of 114 convenience stores, was acquired on 14 August 2004, and JB Beaumont Ltd, a chain of six convenience stores, was acquired on 29 November 2004.
The net assets and results of the acquired businesses are included in the consolidated accounts from their respective dates of acquisition.
Acquisition accounting has been applied in both cases.
The fair values established for these acquisitions during the year ended 26 March 2005 are provisional.
Fair values will be reviewed in the new financial period.
The Directors do not believe that any net adjustments resulting from such review would have a material effect on the Group.

J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 75 Notes to the financial statements continued 32 Contingent liabilities and financial commitments Group commitments to make operating lease payments during the next financial year are as follows: Land and buildings Other leases 2005 2004 2005 2004 m m m m Leases which expire within one year 1 1 2 2 Leases which expire between one and five years 3 2 21 14 Leases which expire after five years 302 262 1 3 Sainsburys Bank 2005 2004 m m Commitments to lend on credit cards, mortgages and personal loans up to and including one year 4,060 2,783 Risk weighted amount 11 11 Operating lease commitments include payments in respect of 16 supermarket properties which were sold in March 2000 for 325 million and leased back by Sainsburys Supermarkets for a period of 23 years at a market rental, which increases by one per cent per annum over the lease period.
Under the arrangement, the Company has provided a residual value guarantee that the properties will realise at least 170 million at the end of the lease period.
In view of the relatively low amount of this guarantee when compared to the present market value of the freehold interests, the likelihood of this guarantee being invoked is regarded by the Directors as remote, therefore, no contingency is recognised in the accounts.
Operating lease commitments include payments in respect of 10 supermarket properties which were sold in July 2000 for 226 million and leased back by Sainsburys Supermarkets for a period of 23 years at a market rental, which increases by one per cent per annum over the lease period.
A residual value guarantee of 39 million has been given by the Company in respect of this transaction.
In view of the relatively low amount of this guarantee when compared to the present market value of the relevant freehold interests, the Directors believe that the likelihood of this guarantee being invoked is remote, therefore, no contingency is recognised in the accounts.
HM Revenue and Customs have challenged the way that Sainsburys Supermarkets accounts for VAT on the Nectar rewards redeemed in stores by customers.
Professional advice has been taken which suggests current treatment is correct.
The possible total liability at 26 March 2005 is 22 million 2004: 14 million and was not provided for in the accounts as it is considered unlikely to arise.
There are a number of contingent liabilities relating to disposals and other contractual liabilities under which it is not considered any liability will arise.
33 Future capital expenditure 2005 2004 m m Contracted but not provided for 390 406 34 Pension costs The pension costs for the UK mainly relate to two funded defined benefit pension schemes, the J Sainsbury Pension and Death Benefit Scheme JSPDBS and the J Sainsbury Executive Pension Scheme JSEPS.
These schemes were closed to new employees on 31 January 2002.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from the Groups assets.
The Group Personal Pension Plan was closed on 31 January 2002.
Two stakeholder pension schemes were launched in April 2002.
The pension cost for the year ended 26 March 2005 under SSAP 24 is based on the results of a triennial valuation carried out by Watson Wyatt, the schemes independent actuaries, as at 29 March 2003, on the projected unit basis.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the actuarial valuations are: JSPDBS JSEPS %% Long-term rate of return on investments before retirement 6.5 6.3 after retirement 6.5 6.3 Average annual increase in total pensionable salary excluding promotional increments 2.5 2.5 Average annual increase in present and future payments 2.5 2.5 Average rate of inflation 2.5 2.5 As at 29 March 2003, the market value of the assets of the UK schemes were 2,258 million 2001: 2,687 million.
The market value was sufficient to cover 93 per cent 2001: 106 per cent of the total liabilities of the schemes, a deficit of 161 million 2001: surplus 145 million.
76 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 Notes to the financial statements continued 34 Pension costs continued Total pension contribution costs for the Group were 99 million for the year ended 26 March 2005 2004: 89 million of which the pension contribution costs of the UK defined benefit schemes and UK defined contribution schemes amounted to 78 million and 20 million respectively 2004: 67 million and 12 million respectively.
There is a variation from the regular cost because of scheme deficits.
These deficits are being amortised over a 14 year period using a method which increases the amount of variation from the regular cost.
The Group also operated defined benefit pension schemes in the US.
The pension costs relating to the US benefit schemes have been determined with the advice of independent actuaries.
The charge to the profit and loss account of 1 million 2004: 10 million has been calculated in accordance with US accounting principles but would not have been materially different had UK accounting principles been applied.
