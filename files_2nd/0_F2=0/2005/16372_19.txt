Financial Review Non-GAAP measures Certain discussions and analyses set out in this Annual Report As investor measures, we believe that there are no GAAP and Accounts include measures which are not dened by measures directly comparable with UFCF and ROIC.
However, generally accepted accounting principles GAAP such as IFRSs in the tables on pages 17 and 18, we reconcile each as follows: or US GAAP.
We believe this information, along with comparable UFCF to cash ow from operating activities and also to net profit: GAAP measurements, is useful to investors because it provides a ROIC to net profit.
basis for measuring our operating performance, ability to retire debt and invest in new business opportunities.
Our management Unilever cautions that, while UFCF and ROIC are widely used as uses these financial measures, along with the most directly tools for investment analysis, they are not dened terms under comparable GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating IFRSs or US GAAP and therefore their denition should be performance and value creation.
Non-GAAP financial measures carefully reviewed and understood by investors.
Investors should should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute be aware that their application may vary in practice and therefore for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP.
these measures may not be fully comparable between companies.
Non-GAAP financial measures as reported by us may not In particular: be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.
Denitions of non-GAAP measures and Unilever recognises that the usefulness of UFCF and ROIC as reconciliations to GAAP measures are provided on indicators of investment value is limited, as such measures are pages 17 to 19. based on historical cost information: Measures of long term value creation UFCF and ROIC measures are not intended to be a substitute Unilevers ambition for the creation of value for shareholders is for, or superior to, GAAP measures in the financial statements: measured by Total Shareholder Return over a rolling three year period compared with a peer group of 20 other companies.
The fact that ROIC is a ratio inherently limits its use, and Unilever believes that the contribution of the business to this management uses ROIC only for the purposes discussed above.

It is longer term economic value: and broadly available to cover the servicing of debt along with other non-discretionary expenditures that have not been deducted The development, over time, of Return on Invested Capital from this measure.
ROIC, which expresses the returns generated on capital invested in the company.
Unilever communicates progress against these measures annually, and management remuneration is aligned with these objectives.
The UFCF over a three year period is incorporated as a performance element of Unilevers management incentive scheme.
UFCF and ROIC are non-GAAP measures under IFRSs and US GAAP.
We include them in this respect since they are the way in which we communicate our ambition and monitor progress towards our longer-term value creation goals and in order to: Improve transparency for investors: Assist investors in their assessment of the long-term value of Unilever: Ensure that the measures are fully understood in light of how Unilever reviews long-term value creation for shareholders: Properly define the metrics used and confirm their calculation: Share the metrics with all investors at the same time: and Disclose UFCF as it is one of the drivers of management remuneration and therefore management behaviour.
16 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Financial Review Non-GAAP measures continued Ungeared free cash ow UFCF expresses the generation of profit by the business and how this is translated into cash, and thus economic value.
It is therefore not used as a liquidity measure within Unilever.
The movement in UFCF is used by Unilever to measure progress against our longer-term value creation goals as outlined to investors.
UFCF is cash ow from group operating activities, less capital expenditure, less charges to operating profit for share-based compensation and pensions, and less tax adjusted to reect an ungeared position, but before the nancing of pensions.
The reconciliation of UFCF to the GAAP measures net profit and cash ow from operating activities is as follows: million million 2005 2004 Net profit 3 975 2 941 Taxation 1 301 836 Share of net profit of joint ventures associates and other income from non-current investments 55 95 Net finance costs 618 631 Depreciation, amortisation and impairment 1 274 2 063 Changes in working capital 193 547 Pensions charges in operating profit less payments 532 472 Movements in provisions less payments 230 574 Elimination of profits on disposals 789 308 Non-cash charge for share-based compensation 192 218 Other adjustments 23 10 Cash ow from operating activities 5 924 6 925 Less charge for share-based compensation 192 218 Add back pension payments less pension charges in operating profit 532 472 Less net capital expenditure 813 869 Less tax charge adjusted to reect an ungeared position 1 440 964 Taxation on profit 1 301 836 Tax relief on net interest expense 139 128 Ungeared free cash ow 4 011 5 346 The tax charge used in determining UFCF can be either the income statement tax charge or the actual cash taxes paid.
Our consistently applied denition uses the income statement tax charge in order to eliminate the impact of volatility due to the variable timing of payments around the year end.
For 2005 and 2004 the income statement tax charge on this basis is materially impacted by the tax effect of non-cash charges for the impairment of Slim Fast and certain other non-cash items.
UFCF based on actual cash tax paid would be 3.7 billion 2004: 4.8 billion.
UFCF reported in the 2004 Annual Report and Accounts was based on cash ow from group operating activities, less capital expenditure and financial investment less a tax charge adjusted to reect an ungeared position.
This measure is the same as dened above in all respects except for the non-cash charge for share-based compensation less payments of 545 million 2004: 114 million, the non-cash charge for pensions less payments of 532 million 2004: 472 million and net financial investment of 33 million 2004: 43 million, resulting in UFCF on this basis of 4 057 million 2004: 4 803 million.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2005 17 Report of the Directors Financial Review Non-GAAP measures continued Return on invested capital Return on invested capital ROIC expresses the returns generated on capital invested in the company.
The progression of ROIC is used by Unilever to measure progress against our longer-term value creation goals outlined to investors.
a ROIC is profit after tax but excluding net interest on net debt and impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets both net of tax, divided by average invested capital for the year.
Invested capital is the sum of property, plant and equipment and other noncurrent investments, software and nite-lived intangible assets, working capital, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at gross book value and cumulative goodwill written off directly to reserves under an earlier accounting policy.
The reconciliation of ROIC to the GAAP measure net profit is as follows: million million 2005 2004 Net profit 3 975 2 941 Add back net interest expense net of tax 424 431 a Add back impairment charges net of tax 245 536 profit after tax, before interest and impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets 4 644 3 908 Year-end positions for invested capital: Property, plant and equipment and other non-current investments 7 333 6 966 Software and nite-lived intangible assets 642 623 Inventories 4 107 3 756 Trade and other receivables 5 061 4 410 Trade payables and other creditors due within one year 8 658 8 232 Elements of invested capital included in assets and liabilities held for sale 200 Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at gross book value 21 621 19 854 Total 30 306 27 377 Add back cumulative goodwill written off directly to reserves 6 870 7 246 Year-end invested capital 37 176 34 623 Average invested capital for the year 37 012 36 444 Return on average invested capital 12.5% 10.7% a Excluding write-downs of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets taken in connection with business disposals.

It is a measure that provides valuable additional information on the underlying performance of the business.
In particular, it presents the organic growth of our business year on year and is used internally as a core measure of sales performance.
