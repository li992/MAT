51 BRITISH ENERGY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES i BASIS OF PREPARATION The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards, except for the departure noted below.
References to British Energy or the Company are to British Energy Group plc, the ultimate holding company of the Group.
References to the Group are to the Company and its subsidiaries.
Commodity trading contracts, where there is no associated physical delivery, are marked to market using externally derived market prices.
This is a departure from the general provisions of Schedule 4 of the Companies Act 1985.
An explanation of this departure is given in note 1 xxii.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results can differ from those estimates.
In accordance with FRS18 Accounting Policies FRS18 the Directors have reviewed the Groups accounting policies and confirm that they are the most appropriate.
A number of the policies require the Group to use a variety of estimation techniques.
Significant factors considered when assessing the carrying value of assets include future electricity prices, expected annual output, expected station operating costs, remaining station lives and discount rates.
Estimates of output, costs and timing of associated cash flows as well as the expected regulatory framework are key factors used to apply the stated policies for long-term nuclear liabilities and decommissioning as discussed further in note 1 xix below.
The accounting policies being applied by British Energy Group plc are, in some cases, different to those which were applied in the past by British Energy plc.
Note 12 to the financial statements provides detail on the re-alignment of those former policies with those applied by British Energy Group plc.
ii BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of British Energy Group plc and all its subsidiary undertakings.
The Company was incorporated on 2 July 2004.
As a consequence of the Restructuring, under a Scheme of Arrangement under Section 425 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company acquired British Energy plc on 14 January 2005.
The Restructuring has been accounted for under the principles of acquisition accounting set out in FRS6 Acquisitions and Mergers FRS6.
The application of acquisition accounting principles means that all the separate assets and liabilities of British Energy plc have been recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition with goodwill arising on the difference between net assets of the Acquired Group and the acquisition consideration paid.
Only the post acquisition results are included in the Group Profit and Loss Account, Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, Group Cash Flow Statement and the accompanying Notes.
Inter-company profits, transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
iii TURNOVER Turnover represents sales of electricity including energy supply costs recharged to customers, net of electricity purchases, and sales of other related goods.
Turnover is shown net of value added tax and climate change levy.
Wholesale generation and direct supply sales are recognised on an accruals basis with reference to meter readings or where required based on managements best estimate of electricity supplied.
Turnover includes miscellaneous income that comprises mainly services to Magnox in respect of shared sites and Renewable Obligation Certificates and Levy Exemption Certificates income.
iv FUEL COSTS NUCLEAR FRONT END ADVANCED GAS-COOLED REACTORS AGR Front end fuel costs consist of the costs of procurement of uranium, conversion and enrichment services and fuel element fabrication.
Fabrication costs comprise fixed and variable elements.
All costs are capitalised into stock and charged to the profit and loss account in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
PRESSURISED WATER REACTOR PWR All front end fuel costs are variable and are charged to the profit and loss account in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
v FUEL COSTS NUCLEAR BACK END AGR Spent fuel extracted from the reactors is sent for reprocessing and or long-term storage and eventual disposal of resulting waste products.
Back end fuel costs comprise:- a a cost per tonne of uranium in AGR fuel, in respect of amounts payable on loading of fuel into any one of the AGR reactors.
b a rebate surcharge against the cost mentioned in a above that is dependent on the outturn electricity price in the year.
The loading related cost and the rebate surcharge is capitalised into stock and charged to the profit and loss account in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
52 BRITISH ENERGY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED v FUEL COSTS NUCLEAR BACK END CONTINUED PWR Back end fuel costs are based on wet storage in station ponds followed by dry storage and subsequent direct disposal of fuel.
Back end fuel costs comprise the estimated cost of this process at current prices discounted back to current value.
Back end fuel costs are capitalised into stock on loading and charged to the profit and loss account in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
vi UNBURNT FUEL AT SHUTDOWN Due to the nature of the nuclear fuel process there will be some unburnt fuel in the reactors at station closure.
The costs of this unburnt fuel final core is fully provided at the balance sheet date and any changes in the carrying value of nuclear fuel attributed to the final core are charged to the profit and loss account in the year.
vii FUEL COSTS COAL Fuel costs for coal are determined on a weighted average cost basis.
Fuel costs for coal also include costs of emission allowances.
The Group recognises liabilities in respect of its obligations to deliver emission allowances to the extent that the allowances to be delivered exceed those previously acquired by the Group, either by allocation from the Government or a similar body or through purchase.
Any liabilities recognised are measured based on the current estimates of the amounts that will be required to satisfy the net obligation.
viii RENEWABLE OBLIGATION CERTIFICATES Annual commitments payable under Renewable Obligation Certificates are reflected in the profit and loss account based on the volume of direct supply sales.
Acquired certificates are recognised as assets on purchase and are offset against related obligation payments.
ix RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Research and development expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
x PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Group provides for pension costs in accordance with FRS17 Retirement Benefits FRS17.
Contributions to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes are assessed by qualified actuaries.
Pension plan assets are measured using market values.
Pension plan liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
Any increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Groups defined benefit pension plans expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged against operating profit.
The expected return on the plans assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the plans liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in other finance income.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
Certain additional unfunded retirement benefits are provided to eligible employees.
The cost of providing such benefits is charged against profits as they accrue.
The capital cost of ex-gratia and supplementary pensions is charged to the profit and loss account, to the extent that the arrangements are not covered by the surplus in schemes, in the accounting period in which they are granted.
xi NLF FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS Under new arrangements with the Secretary of State, the former Nuclear Decommissioning Fund was enlarged into and renamed the Nuclear Liabilities Fund NLF, which will fund, subject to certain exceptions, the Groups qualifying uncontracted nuclear liabilities and qualifying decommissioning costs.
To the extent there is any surplus remaining in the NLF, this amount will be paid to the Secretary of State.
The Group is responsible for funding certain excluded or disqualified liabilities and will, in certain circumstances, be required to compensate or indemnify the NLF and the Secretary of State in relation to such liabilities.
The Groups obligations under these arrangements with the Secretary of State are guaranteed by certain companies in the Group.
In consideration for the assumption of these liabilities by the Secretary of State and the NLF, British Energy Holdings plc issued 275m in New Bonds to the NLF.
The Group will also now make the following payments to the NLF: i an annual contribution Cash Sweep Payment initially equal to 65% of the British Energy Groups adjusted net cash flow, adjusted for certain corporate actions but never to exceed 65% Cash Sweep Percentage : ii fixed decommissioning contributions equal to 20m per annum indexed to RPI but tapering off as the nuclear power stations are currently scheduled to close : and iii 150,000 indexed to RPI for every tonne of uranium in PWR fuel loaded into the Sizewell B reactor after the Restructuring Effective Date.
The NLF has the right from time to time to convert all or part of the Cash Sweep Payment into convertible shares of the Company the NLF Conversion Right.
On a full conversion, the NLF would hold up to 65% of the thereby enlarged equity share capital of the Company.
However, the terms of the Convertible Shares include a limit on the voting rights attaching to such shares equal to a maximum of 29.9% whilst held by the NLF.
At the time of listing the Secretary of State confirmed that she had no current intention to direct the NLF to exercise the NLF Conversion Right but reserved the right to do so.
The annual Cash Sweep Payment can only be determined after the end of the financial year and is contingent based on cash generation in the year.
Therefore, it is only recognised and provided for when it becomes determinable and not in any other interim financial periods.
It will be recorded as an operating cost of the applicable financial year.
The annual Cash Sweep Payment becomes payable 20 business days after publication of the report and accounts.
53 BRITISH ENERGY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED xi NLF FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS CONTINUED The fixed decommissioning obligations of 20m per annum have been recorded as a liability on the balance sheet at their discounted value and disclosed as the NLF liability.
The NLF liability is reduced as payments are made to the NLF.
Each year the financing charges in the profit and loss account include the revalorisation of NLF liabilities required to discharge one years discount from the liability.
PWR fuel loaded after the Restructuring Effective Date will increase the qualifying nuclear liability recognised for back end PWR fuel costs as set out in note 1 v and will increase the NLF receivable by a corresponding amount.
The difference between the payment of 150,000 indexed to RPI per tonne made to the NLF on the loading of PWR fuel and the increase in the liability recognised, and therefore the increase in the NLF receivable, is recorded as a back end fuel cost or credit as appropriate in the year of loading.
xii FOREIGN CURRENCIES Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange under the related forward currency contract.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the balance sheet or at the contracted rate if applicable.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
xiii GOODWILL Goodwill arising on acquisitions represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration at acquisition compared to the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset on the balance sheet.
The Directors have assessed its useful life to be 20 years and the goodwill will be amortised in line with the remaining operating lives of the stations over this period.
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
xiv OPERATING LEASES Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
xv TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATION Fixed assets comprise assets acquired or constructed by the Group.
Expenditure of a capital nature incurred to improve operational performance or to improve safety in order to meet increased regulatory standards is also capitalised.
Other expenditure, including that incurred on preliminary studies and on the initiation of new technologies not yet adopted, is charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Fixed assets other than assets in the course of construction are stated in the balance sheet at cost, or fair value for assets acquired as a result of the Restructuring, less accumulated depreciation.
Accumulated depreciation includes additional charges made where necessary to reflect impairment in value.
Assets in the course of construction are stated at cost and not depreciated until brought into commission.
The carrying values of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment where there has been a trigger event by assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows and net realisable value compared with net book value.
The calculation of estimated future cash flows is based on the Directors best estimates of future prices, output and costs and is therefore subjective.
The charge for depreciation of fixed assets is based on the straight line method so as to write off the costs of assets, after taking into account provisions for diminution in value, over their estimated useful lives.
The asset lives adopted are subject to regular review and for the period ended 31 March 2005 were: AGR power stations 618 years PWR power station 30 years Coal power station 11 years Other buildings 30 years Other plant and equipment 18 months5 years Overhaul costs, being the costs incurred in relation to statutory outages, are capitalised in other plant and equipment and depreciated over the period until the next statutory outage.
For AGR power stations, this depreciation period is three years and for the PWR power station is 18 months.
Overhaul costs for planned outages at Eggborough are capitalised in other plant and equipment and depreciated over the four year period until the next planned outage.
Included within the power station categories are strategic spares, which are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value and depreciated over the life of the asset to which they relate.
xvi FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS Investments in subsidiaries are initially recorded at the cost of shares allotted.
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provisions for diminution in value.
The carrying value of all fixed asset investments is regularly assessed for permanent impairment and provision made, if appropriate.
54 BRITISH ENERGY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED xvii STOCKS OF FUEL AND STORES Stocks of fuel, stores and spares are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The nuclear fuel stock includes capitalised front end and back end costs including the rebate surcharge but is reduced by the provision for unburnt fuel at shutdown note 1 vi.
xviii NLF RECEIVABLE AND NUCLEAR LIABILITIES RECEIVABLE The Government indemnity is provided to indemnify any future shortfall on NLF funding of qualifying uncontracted nuclear liabilities including PWR back end fuel services and qualifying nuclear decommissioning costs.
A NLF receivable asset is recognised representing the aggregate value of the Nuclear Liabilities Fund and the Government indemnity refer to note 15 such that the receivable equals the present value of the associated qualifying liabilities.
The Government indemnity is also provided to cover services for spent AGR fuel loaded pre-Restructuring.
A nuclear liabilities receivable is recognised in respect of the indemnity refer to note 15 such that the receivable equals the present value of the associated qualifying liabilities.
The NLF receivable and the Nuclear liabilities receivables are stated in the balance sheet at current price levels, discounted at a long-term real rate of interest of 3% per annum to take account of the timing of payments.
Each year the financing charges in the profit and loss account include the revalorisation of these receivables required to match the revalorisation of the nuclear liabilities.
xix NUCLEAR LIABILITIES Nuclear liabilities represent provision for the Groups liabilities in respect of the costs of waste management of spent fuel and nuclear decommissioning.
The provisions represent the Directors best estimates of the costs expected to be incurred.
They are calculated based on the latest technical evaluation of the processes and methods likely to be used, and reflect current engineering knowledge.
The provisions are based on such commercial agreements as are currently in place, and reflect the Directors understanding of the current Government policy and regulatory framework.
The Directors carry out an in-depth review of the adequacy of amounts provided on a fiveyearly basis, and also review the amounts provided for significant change during the intervening years.
Given that Government policy and the regulatory framework on which our assumptions have been based may be expected to develop and that the Directors plans will be influenced by improvements in technology and experience gained from decommissioning activities, liabilities and the resulting provisions are likely to be adjusted.
In matching the costs of generating electricity against the income from sales, accruals are made in respect of the following: A FUEL COSTS BACK END The treatment of back end fuel costs in the profit and loss account has been dealt with in notes 1 v and 1 vi.
These nuclear liabilities cover reprocessing and storage of spent nuclear fuel and the long-term storage, treatment and eventual disposal of nuclear waste.
They are based, as appropriate, on contractual arrangements or the latest technical assessments of the processes and methods likely to be used to deal with these obligations under the current regulatory regime.
Where accruals are based on contractual arrangements they are included within creditors.
Other accruals are based on long-term cost forecasts which are reviewed regularly and adjusted where necessary, and are included within provisions.
B DECOMMISSIONING OF NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS The financial statements include provision for the full cost of decommissioning the Groups nuclear power stations.
Provision is made on the basis of the latest technical assessments of the processes and methods likely to be used for decommissioning under the current regulatory regime.
Accruals and provisions for back end fuel costs and decommissioning are stated in the balance sheet at current price levels, discounted at a long-term real rate of interest of 3% per annum to take account of the timing of payments.
Each year the financing charges in the profit and loss account include the revalorisation of liabilities required to discharge one years discount from provisions made in prior years and restate these provisions to current price levels.
xx DEFERRED TAXATION Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is more likely than not that the assets will be realised.
xxi LIQUID FUNDS Cash which is placed on term deposits which mature more than one day after the end of the financial year or invested in commercial paper, is classified under current asset investments in the balance sheet and the movement in liquid funds is disclosed under management of liquid resources in the cash flow statement.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED xxii FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES DEBT INSTRUMENTS All borrowings are stated at cost with issue costs being charged to the profit and loss account on purchase.
The interest payable on debt is charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the borrowing.
Premiums and discounts arising on early repayment of borrowings are recognised in the profit and loss account as incurred and received.
COMMODITY CONTRACTS On 14 January 2005, as part of the acquisition, all power and coal contracts were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet.
As the contracts in existence at 14 January 2005 are satisfied, the fair value recorded on Restructuring is reflected through the profit and loss account as an other operating expense or income.
For contracts entered into since 14 January 2005, where there is physical delivery associated with power and coal commodity contracts they are accounted for on an accruals basis following delivery of the commodity.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of these contracts are recorded within trade creditors and debtors respectively and recognised as turnover.
For contracts entered into since 14 January 2005, where there is no physical delivery associated with these contracts, they are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet.
Where the instrument is for proprietary trading purposes, the change in fair value is reflected through the profit and loss account as other operating expense.
This is not in accordance with the general provisions of Schedule 4 of the Companies Act 1985, which requires that these contracts are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value or that, if revalued, any revaluation difference be taken to a revaluation reserve.
However, the Directors consider that this departure is necessary in order that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the results of the Groups trading activities.
FUTURES AND POWER OPTIONS Power futures and options are undertaken for hedging and proprietary trading purposes.
Initial margins paid on entering power exchange contracts are recorded on the balance sheet within restricted cash in Investment liquid funds throughout the term of the contract.
Where the instrument is a hedge, the daily margin calls are initially reflected on the balance sheet and subsequently reflected through the profit and loss account to match the recognition of the hedged item.
Premiums received and paid on wholesale generation contracts are amortised over the period of the contracts and included within turnover.
TURNOVER, PROFIT ON ORDINARY ACTIVITIES BEFORE TAX AND NET ASSETS The Groups activities consist principally of the generation and sale of electricity from continuing activities acquired on 14 January 2005 based in the United Kingdom.
Turnover, profit on ordinary activities before tax and net assets from the United Kingdom are disclosed in the Group Profit and Loss Account and the Group Balance Sheet.

PROFIT OF THE COMPANY The Groups results include a retained profit of nil attributable to the Company.
The Company has distributable reserves at 31 March 2005 of 652m.
As permitted under Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has not published a separate profit and loss account.
EARNINGS PER SHARE The basic earnings per share for the period has been calculated by dividing the earnings on ordinary activities after taxation by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The diluted earnings per share calculation is based on the weighted average of 560,728,509 ordinary shares in issue together with the dilutive potential ordinary shares of 18,291,587 in respect of Warrants.
The effect of the Cash Sweep is not considered to be dilutive.
The adjustment mechanism for the Cash Sweep Percentage set out in the Contribution Agreement is designed such that the shareholders interest in the Group after taking account of the Cash Sweep remains consistent.
For example, in the event that a Cash Sweep Payment is made without a corresponding dividend then the Cash Sweep Percentage is diluted as if shareholders had reinvested a corresponding amount as new equity in the Group.

FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS Company 2005 m Cost and net book value Acquired on 14 January 2005 1,536 As at 31 March 2005 1,536 The Group has investments in its own shares through holdings held by British Energy Employee Share Trust.
The value of these investments is reflected through the profit and loss account reserve.
Company investments relate wholly to investments in subsidiary undertakings.

A full list of subsidiary undertakings will be annexed to the Companys next annual return.
ACQUISITION OF BRITISH ENERGY PLC On 14 January 2005 British Energy Group plc acquired British Energy plc for a consideration of 1,536m, satisfied by the issue of 561,016,515 ordinary shares of 0.10 at 2.63 each and 29,298,286 warrants at 1.73 each and costs associated with the acquisition of 10m.
The Group has used acquisition accounting methodology to account for the acquisition.
FRS7 Fair values in acquisition accounting FRS7 requires the fair value of the share and warrant consideration for accounting purposes to be determined on the date of acquisition and this is normally done at the market price on that date.
However, British Energy plc had fide-listed on 21 October 2004 prior to acquisition and therefore there is no available share price at the date of the acquisition.
The Directors considered the fair value of the share and warrant consideration by reference to the market value of the New Shares and Warrants on the first full day of trading on 17 January 2005 and determined that the closing share price on that date fairly represented the value of the consideration.
The Group also conducted an exercise to attribute a fair value to all assets including the fixed assets of the Acquired Group.
The Company engaged Standard & Poors Corporate Value Consulting, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc, to assess the fair value of the assets acquired as part of the Restructuring.
The fair value of the total fixed assets was arrived at by assessing the cash flows of the Acquired Group, discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.
The derived value was then allocated across the assets acquired including fixed assets.
The cash flows were derived using both market estimates of future electricity prices and the Company's view of long-term prices.
The Directors have considered the impact on future prices of the increases in market electricity prices which occurred in the past year, the outlook for coal and gas fuel prices, potential for changes in generation capacity in the UK and the potential effect on the market of changes in Government policy particularly in the area of environmental legislation.
The Company price projections were benchmarked against independent estimates.
The Company used output projections prepared and independently reviewed in advance of the listing of the Company.
62 BRITISH ENERGY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 12.
FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS CONTINUED ACQUISITION OF BRITISH ENERGY PLC CONTINUED The outlook for electricity prices is the single most significant factor in the assessment of fair values of fixed assets.
The Directors have considered market views on future prices of wholesale electricity and also commercially available forecasts.
Actual prices may differ from those in the forecast.
The fair value of fixed assets and liabilities assumes that a willing buyer willing seller would have assumed an accounting life extension for Dungeness B of five years on the basis of information available to the Company at the Restructuring Effective Date.

FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS CONTINUED The fair values are provisional, as the Company is aware of changes that may arise.
The Quinquennial Review is scheduled to be completed in autumn 2005 which could impact the fair value of nuclear liabilities as estimated above but would also have a corresponding impact on the quantum of the NLF receivable.
The Directors believe the fair values are based on the best information currently available.
Tangible fixed assets have been increased to reflect the fair value at date of acquisition of the nuclear fleet and Eggborough power station.
The assessment of fair value was conducted in conjunction with Standard & Poors Corporate Value Consulting.
The decommissioning fund has been revalued to bring its value into line with the present value of qualifying nuclear liabilities and is now termed the NLF receivable.
Stock has been revalued to reflect current market prices, in line with the revised contractual arrangements.
The value of the shares held by the employee trusts have been adjusted to reflect their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Incorporation of the nuclear liabilities receivable, which will be used to fund services for spent AGR fuel loaded pre-Restructuring.
Recognition of a deferred tax asset based on the closing balance sheet at 14 January 2005 after the fair value adjustments have been incorporated.

FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS CONTINUED The accounting policy alignments are: 13.
Overhaul costs are capitalised and depreciated over the period until the next statutory or planned outage and strategic spares are included with the carrying value of fixed assets and depreciated over the life of the asset to which they relate.
Strategic spares are now included within the carrying value of fixed assets and not stock.
Accounting policy change to adopt FRS17, resulting in writing off the SSAP24 prepayment of 83m and recognising the pension liability of 428m under FRS17 net of deferred tax of 128m.
Additionally, a deferred tax asset of 5m has been recognised as a result of the change in policy to no longer discount deferred taxation balances.
Following completion of the Restructuring, cash balances held by Lochside Insurance Limited a subsidiary are now classified as liquid funds.
Previously, Lochside Insurance Limited had been disclosed as a fixed asset investment.
Bonds issued to NLF as part of Restructuring.
Cancellation of bonds and recognition of the element of New Bonds issued on Restructuring repayable in under one year.

The adoption of these new UITF Abstracts represented a change in accounting policy.
The Group restated opening reserves to comply with the above UITF Abstracts so that the profit and loss account reserve was decreased by 2m and other fixed asset investments decreased by the same amount as at 1 April 2004.
There was no prior year profit and loss account effect.
The analysis of operating costs of British Energy Limited for the period from 1 April 2004 to 14 January 2005, and for the year ended 31 March 2004 is as follows: 1 April 2004 to Year ended 14 January 31 March 2005 2004 m m OPERATING COSTS Fuel costs 343 413 Materials and services 434 512 Staff costs 240 224 Depreciation charges 59 50 1,076 1,199 Energy supply costs 229 260 Total operating costs before exceptional items 1,305 1,459 EXCEPTIONAL OPERATING ITEMS Materials and services 46 25 Staff costs 11 Depreciation charges credits 3 295 Amounts credited to non-operational assets 13 60 283 Operating costs after exceptional items 1,365 1,176 Analysis of exceptional operating items Restructuring costs 46 43 Settlement of claim 18 Severance costs 11 Fixed asset write-up 295 Depreciation corporate headquarters 3 UK decommissioning fund write-up 13 60 283 66 BRITISH ENERGY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 12.
FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS CONTINUED The exceptional materials and services costs relate to costs incurred on advisory fees and other costs associated with restructuring the Group's activities amounting to 46m for the period to 14 January 2005.

POST RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS British Energy operates two separate pension arrangements in the UK within the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme ESPS, the British Energy Generation Group BEGG for the majority of employees and the British Energy Combined Group BECG for the employees at Eggborough Power Station.
The ESPS is a defined benefit scheme, which is externally funded and subject to triennial actuarial valuation.
Each pension group that participates in the ESPS is financially independent from the other groups.
The most recent triennial valuations of the BEGG and BECG schemes were carried out at 31 March 2004 by the independent ESPS actuary.
The valuations for accounting purposes have been carried out by a separate independent actuary using the projected unit method.
British Energy contributed 17.1% to the BEGG pension scheme and 15.3% to the BECG pension scheme for the period from 15 January 2005 to 31 March 2005.
Contributing members contribute 5% and 6% to the respective plans.
Any deficiency disclosed in the BEGG or BECG pension schemes following an actuarial valuation has to be borne by British Energy.
The Groups pension costs for the period to 31 March 2005 were 9m.
At 31 March 2005 there was 1m of contributions owed to the pension scheme included in accruals.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries for the defined benefit plans were: 2005 % p. a.
Price inflation 2.75 Rate of general increase in salaries 4.25 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.75 Discount rate 5.50 The assets and liabilities of the schemes and the expected rates of return are: Rate of 31 March return 2005 %m Equities 8.20 1,127 Bonds 4.70 502 Property 6.45 212 Hedge funds 6.70 85 Others 4.00 44 Total market value of plan assets 1,970 Present value of plan liabilities 2,318 Pension liability before deferred tax 348 Related deferred tax asset 104 Net pension liability 244 74 BRITISH ENERGY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 24.

These additional contributions will rise to 50.3m for the year ending 31 March 2009 and remain at that level until the year ending 31 March 2017.
The requirement for additional contributions will be reviewed as part of the next triennial valuation on 31 March 2007.
From 1 April 2005 the rate of employers regular contributions for future service benefits under the Combined Group increased from 15.3% to 19.7%.
The Group will also be making additional employer contributions towards the Combined Group funding deficiency, having regard to appropriate funding advice.

CALLED UP SHARE CAPITAL CONTINUED CONVERTIBLE SHARES The convertible shares may only be held by Nuclear Liabilities Fund Limited or its successor in title, a Minister of the Crown, the Treasury, a department, non-departmental body or other agency of the Crown, any body corporate established by statute some or all of the members of which are appointed by a Minister of the Crown or other UK Government entity or any person directly or indirectly wholly owned by, or held on trust for, the Secretary of State or other Minister of the Crown.
Save in respect of voting rights, the convertible shares have the same rights, are subject to the same restrictions and rank pari passu with the ordinary shares of the Company in all respects.
The number of votes that the holder of the convertible shares is entitled to exercise in respect of its holding of convertible shares is the lesser of: i 29.9% and, for this purpose, taking into account the voting rights attributable to any other ordinary shares held or acquired by any person acting in concert with the holder : and ii the number of convertible shares which the holder would otherwise be entitled to vote if the convertible shares were ordinary shares.
The convertible shares will convert into ordinary shares of the Company automatically on transfer to a third party by the holder but are not convertible at the election of the holder prior to such transfer.
SHARE OPTION SCHEMES Details of Share Option Schemes are set out on page 39 of the Remuneration Committee Report.
Share options were granted in previous years by British Energy Limited.
Legal advice has been obtained to the effect that the changes in the corporate structure of the Group as a result of the Restructuring did not trigger the early exercise provisions under these options.
The Remuneration Committee decided not to allow holders of options in British Energy Limited to roll them over into options over shares in the Company.
The options granted by British Energy Limited are still capable of exercise, but immediately on exercise the shares will be converted into shares in the Company in the ratio of 50:1.
Accordingly the effective exercise price of the options is significantly higher than the current share price and it is unlikely the options will be exercised.

RECONCILIATION OF MOVEMENT IN SHAREHOLDERS FUNDS CONTINUED The Restructuring involved Bondholders and the Significant Creditors compromising their claims against the Group in exchange for, amongst other things, the issue of New Bonds by British Energy Holdings plc a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and new ordinary shares of the Company.
In addition shareholders in British Energy plc were entitled to receive New Shares and Warrants in the Company.
The Warrants entitle the holder to subscribe for ordinary New Shares in the Company within five years of the Restructuring.
As part of the Restructuring, the amounts owed to Bondholders and Significant Creditors were exchanged for New Bonds and a longterm project finance loan note 17.
The other capital reserve was created on the issue of New Shares and represents the excess of the legal liability foregone by the Significant Creditors and Bondholders over the fair value of their claims.
The other capital reserve is not distributable.
As a consequence of the accounting treatment adopted for the Restructuring the fair value of certain debts novated at the time of the Restructuring was less than their original legal liability.
The shares issued were recorded at the original legal liability and the difference between this and the market value at Restructuring resulted in a loss of 85m, which has been taken directly to profit and loss reserves.
The share premium recorded represents the excess of the fair value of the shares issued at Restructuring over their nominal value less the amount allocated to other capital reserves as noted above.
On 25 January 2005, the Court approved a reduction of British Energy Group plcs share premium account from 737m to nil, thereby creating distributable reserves of 737m.
The warrant reserve was created at Restructuring and represents the fair value of the Warrants issued at that date.
As the Warrants are exercised this reserve will be transferred to share capital and the share premium account.

MAJOR NON-CASH TRANSACTIONS The consideration for the purchase of British Energy Limited comprised shares and warrants.
Further details of the acquisition are set out in note 12.
CONTINGENT ASSETS In addition to the consideration payable by the consortium under the master purchase agreement, up to a further C$100m was payable to British Energy contingent upon the restart of two of the Bruce A units under a trust agreement the Trust Agreement entered into on the same date.
Had the first unit restarted by 15 June 2003, C$50m would have been released to British Energy and an additional C$50m would have been released to British Energy had the second unit restarted by 1 August 2003.
An amount of C$5m was to be deducted from the C$50m payable in respect of each unit for its failure to restart by the scheduled restart date or by the first day of each successive calendar month following the scheduled restart date.
The Group received C$20m on 22 March 2004 and C$10m on 25 May 2004 in partial consideration under the Trust Agreement.
British Energy commenced arbitration proceedings in Ontario against the Ontario Provincial Government the Province in December 2004 seeking the payment of additional consideration under the Trust Agreement on the basis that Bruce A Units 3 and 4 restarted earlier than the dates claimed by the Province.
No additional amounts appear on our balance sheet at 31 March 2005 because of uncertainties regarding their realisation.
The amounts recoverable in respect of the restarted units will be substantially lower than the maximum C$100m but the amounts and timing of the payments have still to be confirmed.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES On 12 February 2004 British Energy plc received a notice of warranty claims from the consortium which purchased the Group's 82.4% interest in Bruce Power alleging breach of certain warranties and representations relating to tax and to the condition of certain plant at the Bruce Power Station.
The claim relating to the condition of the plant is based upon alleged erosion of some of the steam generator support plates through which boiler tubes pass, which it is alleged resulted in an extended outage of one unit at the plant to carry out repair works and loss of revenues and costs of approximately C$64.5m.
The consortium also claims that the alleged erosion may reduce the operating life of the unit and or result in further repairs involving further losses.
British Energy has rejected the claim and expects to defend it if it is pursued further.
The principal tax claim relates to the treatment of expenditure at the Bruce Power Station during the period of the Company's ownership which is currently being considered by the Canadian tax authorities.
The treatment proposed by British Energy could result in a rebate of a material amount of tax to the Group which has not been recognised in the financial statements of the period.
The consortium claims that allowance of the expenditure for that period would cause it to lose future deductions.
On the basis of advice received, the Company is confident that the amount of the claim should not, in any event, materially exceed the amount of the rebate, and that the claim should have no material cash flow impact on the Group.
Under the agreement with the consortium C$20m is retained in trust to meet any representation and warranty claims, and this may be retained pending agreement or determination of the claims.
The Group has given certain indemnities and guarantees in respect of the disposal of its investment in AmerGen.
The Company has given certain indemnities and guarantees in respect of its subsidiary undertakings.
No losses are anticipated to arise under these indemnities and guarantees, provided relevant subsidiary undertakings continue on a going concern basis.
The Group is involved in a number of other claims and disputes arising in the normal course of business which are not expected to have a material effect on the Groups financial position.

RELATED PARTIES The Company is a public limited company owned by our shareholders and operates within an extensive contractual framework established as part of the Restructuring.
The most significant contract, in terms of the limitations it places on the business, is the Contribution Agreement between the Secretary of State and the Company.
Within this contractual framework, the Company is managed independently by the Board, which continues to direct the finances and operating policies of the Group and is subject to the normal private sector disciplines, fiduciary duties and Companies Act requirements.
The Company considers that no party is a controlling party under the terms of FRS8, Related Party Disclosures.
The Group considers Her Majestys Government HMG to be a related party due to the significant influence exercised by HMG following the Groups Restructuring.
The following transactions took place during the period with HMG and sponsored bodies under its control: As part of the Restructuring arrangements which took place on 14 January 2005: HMG undertook to meet the Groups historic contracted nuclear liabilities to British Nuclear Fuels Limited BNFL, a Government controlled body.
This undertaking resulted in an asset of 2,467m being recognised in the Group's financial statements on 14 January 2005.
The NLF, a Government controlled company, was issued with Bonds of 275m by British Energy Holdings plc as part of the Restructuring.
Interest paid on these bonds during the period amounted to 4m, and 9m of the bonds were repaid during the period, leaving a balance of bonds payable to the NLF of 266m as at 31 March 2005.
The Group made regular decommissioning funding contributions to the NLF of 5m during the period.
The Group made payments to BNFL of 77m during the period in respect of front and back end fuel costs.
The Group also incurred interest costs of 1m in respect of deferred payments and stock financing.
The balance outstanding due to BNFL at the end of the period was nil.
Amounts due to the Group by BNFL at 31 March 2005 under the Historic Liability Funding Agreement amounted to 2,312m.
The Group has also had a number of material transactions in its normal course of business with other sponsored bodies and departments of HMG including HM Revenue and Customs and the UK Atomic Energy Authority.
The Group has identified certain transactions with Directors that require to be disclosed as Related Party transactions.
A payroll systems error was identified and subsequently rectified during the year ended 31 March 2005.
As a result of this error, personal retirement benefit contributions were not deducted in full from the salary of some higher paid employees.
Following detailed investigation, the individuals concerned, including two Directors of the Company, Mike Alexander and David Gilchrist were granted up until 31 March 2008 by the company's Remuneration Committee to repay the salary overpayments of 26,820 and 15,483 respectively.
After further consideration, the Company recognised that this extended time period might constitute a breach of s330 of the Companies Act 1985 and, requested that all outstanding amounts be repaid.
Mike Alexander had repaid 13,600 up to the end of July 2005.
The balance will be recovered from him as part of any payment of compensation for loss of office.
David Gilchrist had repaid the full amount overpaid by 31 March 2005.
