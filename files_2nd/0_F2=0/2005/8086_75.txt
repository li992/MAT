A corresponding increase to the Reserve for Own Shares has been made.
2 Under FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends to shareholders declared after the balance date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
The final dividend accrued in the 2004 UK GAAP Financial Statements has therefore been reversed.
Under FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement, all hedging activity is taken to the balance sheet.
There is no profit and loss impact during 2004, however an amount of 2,451,000 was taken to the hedging and translation reserve with a corresponding increase in accruals.
