This has given rise to a deferred tax credit of 44,138,000.
There is no tax charge on the capital gain realised on the disposal of The fide Vere Belfry, as this gain will be rolled over into the Groups capital expenditure.
A deferred tax provision, arising from timing differences between capital allowances and depreciation of 7,363,000 has been released following the disposal of The fide Vere Belfry.
There is a taxation credit of 6,988,000 relating to the fixed asset impairments charge.

The deferred tax provision has not been discounted.
iii Factors that may affect future tax charges As a result of deferred and overseas tax, the Group expects its tax charge for the foreseeable future to remain at an effective rate close to the UK Corporation Tax rate of 30%.
However the Group does not expect to pay any significant amounts of cash tax in the medium term.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised where the likelihood of realisation fails to meet the more likely than not criterion.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property or on the sale of properties where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
At the year-end the total unprovided deferred tax on assets if sold at book value, including the impact of gains rolled over against these assets, would be 79 million 2004: 91 million.
A significant proportion of this relates to the capital gains arising after the disposal of the managed and tenanted public houses in 1999 and 2000 for 370 million and 1.3 billion respectively.
The capital gain is subject to agreeing March 1982 valuations for individual pubs and goodwill for the business and other factors.
Agreement of these valuations will take time to resolve and will result in additional capital losses which could be recognised to offset the 79 million.
Such tax would only become payable if the properties were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief and if expenditure on replacement assets were less than anticipated.
However, it is not expected that any capital gain will be crystallised in the foreseeable future.

Pensions a Pensions The Group operates a contracted-out defined benefit scheme, The Greenalls Group Pension & Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme, the assets of which are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The Scheme is now closed to new members.
Contributions are paid into the Scheme in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations.
The latest formal triennial actuarial valuation, carried out on 5 April 2003, disclosed that the value of the Schemes assets totalled 197 million at market value, which represented 83% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The liabilities were valued on a market-related projected unit basis.
Under this basis the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
After consultation with the Groups actuaries and the Pension Trustees, the Group has agreed to make additional contributions of 2.8 million per annum from February 2004 over the next thirteen years and this will be reviewed at the next triennial valuation in April 2006.
The additional contributions will be increased annually in line with wage inflation.
