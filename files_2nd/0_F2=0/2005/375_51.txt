The following notes and reconciliations provide an explanation of the impact of the transition to IFRS.
First-time adoption of IFRS The rules for first-time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
The Group is required to establish its IFRS accounting policies which it will use to prepare its results for the year to 31 December 2005 and, in general, apply these retrospectively to determine its opening balance sheet under IFRS at 1 January 2004, the date of transition.
The standard permits certain optional exemptions from this general principle.
The Group has elected to take the following principal exemptions and the information presented has been prepared on this basis.
Business combinations prior to the date of transition IFRS 3, Business Combinations The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations which occurred prior to the date of transition.
Share-based payments IFRS 2, Share-based Payment The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2 to all relevant share-based payment transactions granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005.
Employee benefits IAS19, Employee Benefits The Group has elected to take the exemption available within IAS 19 and has eliminated unrecognised actuarial gains and losses by setting them off against equity in the opening IFRS balance sheet.
Financial instruments IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement The Group has elected to apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005.
Therefore the comparative financial information in respect of financial instruments is presented in accordance with UK GAAP as applicable in 2004.
The implementation of IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005 has resulted in an adjustment to the carrying value of the Groups convertible bond, mark to market adjustments in respect of financial instruments and the recognition of financial liabilities including put options.
Cumulative translation differences The Group has elected that all cumulative translation differences arising from the retranslation of overseas subsidiaries are re-set to zero at the date of transition, 1 January 2004.
