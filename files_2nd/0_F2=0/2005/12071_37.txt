Share options In 2002 the Company extended an option to a director of the Company to acquire up to 75,000 ordinary shares of US$1.00 each at US$25.00 per share.
On 18 May 2005, this option agreement was cancelled.
As part of an investment agreement entered into in May 2002 note 22, 3i was issued one B ordinary share.
The Company also granted an option to 3i to acquire shares representing 13.0% of the Companys share capital, as so enlarged the Option Shares, subject to adjustment to 20.0% in the event of the 3i variable rate unsecured loan notes remaining unpaid.
On 21 October 2004, this option was amended, providing 3i with a revised right to acquire shares representing 16.2% of the Companys share capital, as so enlarged, subject to adjustment to 23.2% in the event of the 3i variable rate unsecured loan notes remaining unpaid.
The option was exercisable by 3i at any time until 30 June 2009 and by the Company upon the fulfilment of certain conditions.
During the year, the conditions allowing the Company to call upon 3i to subscribe for the Options Shares were satisfied and, on 21 June 2005, the aggregate subscription amount was satisfied by the cancellation of the loan notes and the issue of 1,397,557 A ordinary shares to 3i.
In addition, and as part of the consideration for the Option Shares, the one B ordinary share held by 3i was converted to a deferred ordinary share Class B.
This deferred ordinary share had no right to receive notice of general meetings of the Company or rights to attend or vote at general meetings and on 7 October 2005 was redeemed at its nominal value.
Under IAS 32, the Company classified the A ordinary shares as a financial liability, as the then Articles of Association of the Company provided the shares with priority of dividends, including the right to an annual 5% fixed dividend.
The then Articles of Association of the Company also provided that certain matters, including the approval of certain ordinary share dividends, the conversion of A ordinary shares to ordinary shares and the approval of certain ordinary share transfers, required the approval of the holders of 75% or more of the A ordinary shares.

There have been no awards or commitments made in relation to these schemes either in the year or since the reporting date and before the completion of these financial statements.
