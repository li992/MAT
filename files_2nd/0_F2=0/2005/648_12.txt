This is because short term deposit balances are included within the definition of cash and cash equivalents under IFRS but are excluded from the definition of cash under UK GAAP.
There are no other differences to the cash flows as reported under IFRS from those reported under UK GAAP.
The difference between the net funds figure at 31 December 2004 and the net funds figure at 1 January 2005 is the effect of applying IAS 32 and IAS 39 at 1 January 2005.
The impact of applying these standards was to increase long term debt by 4.5m, due to the 9% cumulative preference shares being reclassified from share capital to borrowings.
