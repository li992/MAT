The change in the weighted average rate year on year relates to the mix of profit and loss in each jurisdiction.
There has been no significant change in the statutory tax rate in any jurisdiction that is material to the group in 2005.
In 2006, the effective tax rate for UK ring fence profits is expected to rise from 40 per cent to 50 per cent following the rise in the supplementary corporation tax rate announced by the UK government in 2005.
This change will be recognised in 2006 once it has been substantively enacted.
There are no significant unrecognised temporary differences associated with undistributed profits of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
The amount of unused tax losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the balance sheet is US$169 million 2004: US$138 million.
44 Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2005 7 Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit after tax and on the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year.
The diluted earnings per share allows for the full exercise of outstanding share purchase options and adjusted earnings.
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows: Weighted average Profit after tax number of shares Earnings per share 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 $ million $ million million million cents cents Basic 38.6 22.1 82.1 82.7 47.0 26.8 Outstanding share options 0.7 1.8 Diluted 38.6 22.1 82.8 84.5 46.6 26.1 The inclusion of the outstanding share options in the 2005 and 2004 calculations produce a diluted earnings per share.

These amounts will be written off to the income statement as exploration expense unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment.
The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of E&E assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.

Depreciation and amortisation for oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of proved and probable reserves at the end of the period plus production in the period, on a field-by-field basis.
Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly references its estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.

Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2005 49 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 December 2005 16 Provision for liabilities and charges 2005 2004 $ million $ million Warranties: At 1 January 2.5 2.5 At 31 December 2.5 2.5 Decommissioning costs: At 1 January 39.1 20.1 Revision arising from change in estimate of future decommissioning costs 1.0 15.4 Unwinding of discount on decommissioning provision 1.7 2.0 Exchange differences 3.3 1.6 At 31 December 38.5 39.1 Total provisions 41.0 41.6 The warranty provision represents amounts warranted to Kufpec under the PKP joint venture agreement for pre-effective date amendments to tax balances that may or may not occur in the future.
The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to the UK, West Africa and Pakistan oil and gas interests, which are expected to be incurred between 2006 and 2031.
These provisions have been created based on Premiers internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Based on the current economic environment, assumptions have been made which the management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required, which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
17 Financial instruments The groups activities expose it to financial risks of changes, primarily in oil and gas prices but also foreign currency exchange and interest rates.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain of these risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the groups policies and approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
It is group policy that all transactions involving derivatives must be directly related to the underlying business of the group.
The group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative exposures.
Premier undertakes oil and gas price hedging periodically within Board limits to protect operating cash flow against weak prices.
Oil and gas hedging is mostly undertaken with collar options and to a lesser extent with swaps.
During the year the group covered its oil and gas exposures as follows: a Oil production: approximately 58 per cent of its forecasted production from 2006 to the end of 2010 by entering into Dated Brent oil price options with floors at an average price of US$37.4 bbl and a cap price of US$100.0 bbl, for which it paid a premium of US$3.6 million.
b Gas production: approximately 33 per cent of the Indonesian gas production, for which HSFO Singapore 180cst is the variable component, has been covered from 2006 to 2009 at a floor price of US$200 metric tonne and a ceiling price of US$480 metric tonne.
No swaps were entered into.
The fair value of the above oil hedges is an asset of US$3.3 million and for the gas hedges a liability of US$1.7 million each of which is recognised in the balance sheet in trade and other payables receivables.
While the above hedges were assessed to be effective, all the movements in the fair values have been recognised in the income statement, as all such movements represent time-value portion of hedges under IAS 39.
The fair value of the above hedge has been determined from the bank counterparties with whom the hedges have been concluded.
During the year, oil and gas hedges entered into in previous years matured, generating a settlement loss of US$15.7 million 2004: loss of US$23.0 million all of which was offset against sales revenue.

The floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank borrowings bearing interest at rates set by reference to US$ LIBOR, exposing the group to a cash flow interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets The interest rate profile of the financial assets of the group as at 31 December was: Floating rate Interest free Total $ million $ million $ million 2005 Cash and short-term deposits: Sterling 0.7 0.7 US$ 30.2 6.8 37.0 Other 1.1 1.1 Total 30.9 7.9 38.8 2004 Cash and short-term deposits: Sterling 3.7 3.7 US$ 51.2 4.3 55.5 Other 0.4 0.4 Total 54.9 4.7 59.6 The floating rate cash and short-term deposits consists of cash held in interest-bearing current accounts and deposits placed on the money market for periods ranging from overnight to three months.

Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
The estimated fair values have been determined using market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
Values recorded are indicative and will not necessarily be realised.
Non-interest bearing financial instruments, accounts receivable from customers, and accounts payable are recorded materially at fair value reflecting their short-term maturity and are not shown in the above table.
Credit risk The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables which were immaterial in 2005.
The group does not require collateral or other security to support receivables from customers or related parties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
Currency risk Some US$ sterling exposures were hedged with forward contracts during the year which were not material.
Premiers activities are largely conducted in US$.
All borrowings at the year-end were denominated in US$ to match the currency of the assets.

24 Group pension schemes 2005 2004 $ million $ million UK funded pension scheme 7.0 6.2 UK unfunded pension scheme 0.9 1.7 Indonesia unfunded termination benefit scheme 3.3 2.6 11.2 10.5 The group operates a defined benefit scheme in the UK The Premier Oil Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme.
The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution scheme was started.
Both schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
As a consequence of being closed to new entrants, the current service costs of the Scheme will increase as the members approach retirement.
The pension cost for the Scheme is determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The most recent formal valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2005 using the Attained Age Method and a market-related funding basis, of which the principle financial assumptions were investment return: 6.5 per cent pa, salary growth: 4.8 per cent pa and pension increases: 2.8 per cent pa.
The market value of the Schemes assets was 9.9 million and, on the specific method and assumptions adopted, the assets covered 93 per cent of the members accrued benefits based on the projected pensionable salaries.
During 2005, the employer contributed to the Scheme at the rate of 26 per cent of the pensionable salaries up to 31 July 2005 and, as from 1 August 2005, at 19 per cent of the pensionable salaries together with a further monthly amount of 18,500: in addition, the employer paid a lump sum contribution of 960,000 in May 2005.
Aside from any further lump sum contribution, the employer expects to contribute 328,000 to the Scheme in 2006.
In addition, the group is paying an unfunded pension to a former director of the company in regard to which annual increases and a reversionary spouses pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme.
The following figures have been prepared in compliance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits by an independent actuary on the basis of membership data current as at 31 December 2005.
The benefit obligations and service costs have been measured using the projected unit credit method and pension expense has been assessed on the basis that the group adopts the policy of fully recognising actuarial gains and losses during the period in which they arise.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: 2005 2004 % pa % pa Discount rate 4.8 5.3 Salary growth 4.9 4.8 Return on assets 5.5 6.0 Price inflation 2.9 2.8 Pension increases 2.9 2.8 Defined benefit obligations and assets: 2005 2004 $ million $ million Value of funded benefit obligation 28.1 25.1 Less fair value of scheme assets 21.1 18.9 Liability in balance sheet 7.0 6.2 56 Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2005 24 Group pension schemes continued Pension expense: 2005 2004 $ million $ million Service costs 0.3 0.6 Interest costs 1.3 1.2 Expected return on pension scheme assets 1.1 1.0 Investment gains 1.6 0.2 Actuarial losses 4.9 1.1 Total pension expense in the year 3.8 1.7 Changes in the present value of benefit obligations: 2005 2004 $ million $ million At 1 January 25.1 20.9 Service costs excluding employee contributions 0.3 0.5 Employee contributions 0.1 Interest costs 1.3 1.2 Benefits paid 0.5 0.3 Actuarial losses 4.9 1.1 Currency translation effects 3.0 1.6 At 31 December 28.1 25.1 Changes in fair value of scheme assets: 2005 2004 $ million $ million Assets at 1 January 18.9 16.2 Employer contributions 2.2 0.5 Employee contributions 0.1 Actual return on scheme assets 2.7 1.2 Benefits paid 0.5 0.3 Currency translation effects 2.2 1.2 At 31 December 21.1 18.9 Portfolio distribution and expected returns at 31 December: 2005 2004 Expected Expected rate of return rate of return % pa $ million % pa $ million Equities 6.8 8.7 7.3 8.4 Bonds 4.8 5.9 5.3 5.4 Cash 4.5 6.5 4.7 5.1 Reconciliation of balance sheet liability: 2005 2004 $ million $ million At 1 January 6.2 4.6 Pension expense for the year 3.8 1.7 Contributions paid 2.2 0.6 Currency translation effects 0.8 0.5 At 31 December 7.0 6.2 Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2005 57 Income statement reconciliation For the year ended 31 December 2004 Notes a b c d UK GAAP Joint venture Pre-licence numbers in proportional Employee costs write Deferred IFRS format consolidation benefits back PRT $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million Sales revenues 196.0 55.8 Cost of sales 108.4 20.6 Total exploration expense 14.3 3.9 General and administration costs 15.5 1.5 Share on net income from joint ventures 23.6 23.6 Operating profit 81.4 11.6 1.5 3.9 Interest revenue and finance gains 1.9 0.1 Finance costs and other finance expenses 7.6 0.2 Profit before tax 75.7 11.5 1.5 3.9 Tax 31.9 11.5 4.5 Profit after tax 43.8 1.5 3.9 4.5 Earnings per share cent : Basic 53.0 Diluted 52.1 Notes: a Joint ventures proportional consolidation Joint venture arrangements which involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest are referred to as jointly controlled entities JCEs.
Under IFRS the group reports its interests in JCEs using proportionate consolidation, ie the groups share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of JCEs are combined with the equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Under UK GAAP the group accounted for its 50 per cent share in Premier-Kufpec Pakistan BV PKP as an interest in a joint venture under FRS 9 Associates and Joint Ventures.
FRS 9 required the group to show its proportion of operating profit or loss, exceptional items, interest, tax, gross assets and gross liabilities of the joint venture as part of the financial statements.
The change to proportional consolidation will result in a major presentational change in the way JCE balances are stated on the face of the income statement.
However, this does not result in any impact on the net profits of the group.
b Employee benefits The group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses as at 31 December 2004 on all of its long-term employee benefit schemes including funded pension plans.
The impact of this election is a US$ 1.5 million additional charge in the income statement.
c Pre-licence exploration costs IFRS requires that all pre-licence costs are written off in the year that they are incurred.
On transition to IFRS all such costs existing at 1 January 2004 were written off to shareholders funds.
Some of the costs, which remained capitalised at 1 January 2004 under UK GAAP, were written off in the UK GAAP 2004 results as the related projects were considered unsuccessful.
This adjustment reverses the impact of such write-offs in the 2004 income statement, as they had already been written off on transition, amounting to US$3.9 million.
d Deferred Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT IFRS requires that deferred PRT be calculated on a temporary difference basis, a departure from Premiers former unit of production UOP method.
This has resulted in a higher provision in the opening IFRS balance sheet and a portion US$4.5 million of the additional provision has been released during 2004 due to the reversal of temporary differences.
