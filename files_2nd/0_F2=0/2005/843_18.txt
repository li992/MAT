Notes to the consolidated accounts 1 Significant accounting policies AMEC plc is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
Statement of compliance The group accounts include the accounts of AMEC plc AMEC and all of its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year, and the groups share of the profit after interest and tax, and net assets of joint ventures and associates, based on the equity method of accounting.
In accordance with EU law IAS Regulation EC 1606 2002, the consolidated accounts of the group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted for use in the EU as at 31 December 2005 adopted IFRS, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The company has elected to prepare its parent company accounts in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP : these are presented on pages 104 to 111.
These are the groups first accounts prepared under adopted IFRS and, IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Reporting Standards, has been applied.
Details of how the groups results and financial position are affected by the change to adopted IFRS are set out in note 31.
IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosure was available for early application but has not been applied by the group in their consolidated accounts.
The application of IFRS 7 in 2005 would not have affected the balance sheet or income statement as the standard is concerned only with disclosure.
The group plans to adopt it in 2007.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated accounts and in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 for the purposes of the transition to adopted IFRS.
Basis of preparation The accounts are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Some of these policies require a high level of judgement, and AMEC believes that the most critical accounting policies and significant areas of judgement and estimation arise from the accounting for defined benefit pension schemes under IAS 19 Employee benefits and for long-term contracts under IAS 11 Construction contracts.
Defined benefit pension schemes are accounted for in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries but significant judgements are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, inflation, investment returns and member longevity that underpin their valuations.
A significant amount of the groups activities are undertaken via long-term contracts.
These contracts are accounted for in accordance with IAS 11 which requires estimates to be made for contract costs and revenues.
Management base their judgements of contract costs and revenues on the latest available information, which includes detailed contract valuations.
In many cases the results reflect the expected outcome of long-term contractual obligations which span more than one reporting period.
Contract costs and revenues are affected by a variety of uncertainties that depend on the outcome of future events and often need to be revised as events unfold and uncertainties are resolved.
The estimates are updated regularly and significant changes are highlighted through established internal review procedures.
The impact of the changes in accounting estimates is then reflected in the ongoing results.
Accounting for PPP contracts In determining the appropriate accounting policy for AMECs PPP activities, the directors have considered the current status of the draft IFRIC interpretations on service concession arrangements.
The draft interpretations were issued in 2005 and IFRIC is currently reviewing the responses it has received.
However, the final form of the interpretations and the timetable for their finalisation by IFRIC and adoption by the EU remains uncertain.
In view of this uncertainty, adopted IFRS contains no accounting requirements that specifically apply to service concession arrangements and the directors consider that it remains appropriate to apply the approach set out in Application Note F of the UK Financial Reporting Standard 5 Reporting the substance of transactions in determining the accounting model to be applied to AMECs PPP activities.
This involves applying a risks and rewards test to determine whether a non-current asset or finance debtor model should be followed.
Once the accounting model has been determined, the assets and liabilities of the service concession arrangements will be accounted for in accordance with adopted IFRS.
This accounting policy does not differ significantly from that applied under UK GAAP.
AMEC plc annual report 2005 71 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation A subsidiary is an entity controlled by AMEC.
Control is achieved where AMEC has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
A joint venture entity is an entity over whose activities AMEC has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated accounts include the groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of jointly controlled entities on an equity accounted basis.
An associate is an entity in which AMEC has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Losses of a joint venture or an associate are recognised only to the extent of the groups interest in the joint venture or associate, unless the group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
Jointly controlled operations and assets where each party has its own separate interest in particular risks and rewards, are accounted for by including the attributable share of the assets it controls, liabilities and cash flows it incurs and its share of the income measured according to the terms of the arrangement.
Bid costs Bid costs are expensed as incurred until the group is appointed as the preferred bidder.
Subsequent to appointment as preferred bidder, bid costs are capitalised and held on the balance sheet provided the award of the contract is virtually certain and it is expected to generate sufficient net cash flow to allow recovery of the bid costs.
Where bid costs are reimbursed at financial close, the proceeds are applied first against the balance of costs included in the balance sheet, with any additional amounts treated as deferred income and released to profit over the period of the contract.
Business combinations and goodwill The purchase method is used to account for all business combinations.
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 January 2004 is capitalised and subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that its carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made prior to 1 January 1998 has been written-off to reserves.
Under IFRS 1 and IFRS 3 Business Combinations this goodwill will now remain eliminated against reserves.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made in the period from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2003 was amortised under UK GAAP.
This goodwill is carried at the UK GAAP carrying value at the date of transition and is subject to impairment reviews as described above.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of AMECs cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
Construction and other long-term contracts As soon as the outcome of a construction or other long-term contract can be estimated reliably, contract revenue and expenses are recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract.
The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work performed.
When the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recovered, and contract costs are expensed as incurred.
An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The gross amounts due from customers under construction and other long-term contracts are stated at cost plus recognised profits, less provision for recognised losses and progress billings.
These amounts are reported in trade and other receivables.
Payments on account in excess of the gross amounts due from customers are included in trade and other payables.
Employee benefits Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit plans The groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discount to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets at bid price is deducted.
The liability discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses were recognised in full in equity on transition to adopted IFRS on 1 January 2004.
Actuarial gains and losses that arise subsequent to 1 January 2004 are recognised directly in equity in the year in which they arise.
72 AMEC plc annual report 2005 1 Significant accounting policies continued Financial instruments Under the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, AMEC elected not to adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39 in its financial information for the year ended 31 December 2004 and as a result, UK GAAP has been applied in accounting for financial instruments in the year ended 31 December 2004.
In the comparative period, other than as noted below, all financial assets and financial liabilities were carried at cost amortised as appropriate less, in the case of financial assets, provisions for any permanent diminution in value.
Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts treated as hedging instruments were not recognised in the income statement.
On recognition of the hedged transaction the unrecognised gains and losses arising on the instrument were recognised, either in the income statement or combined into the carrying value of the associated asset or liability.
Interest differentials arising from the interest rate swaps were recognised by adjusting net interest payable or receivable over the period of the contract.
On 1 January 2005, AMEC adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39, and applied the following policy in accounting for financial instruments.
Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value.
Subsequent valuation depends on the designation of the instrument.
Cash, deposits and short-term investments are held at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
All of AMECs hedging activities are non-speculative.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge against the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and is included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gain or loss that was recognised directly in equity is reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss, i. e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity discontinues hedge accounting but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Fair value hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge against the variability in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged even if it is normally carried at cost or amortised cost and any gains or losses on re-measurement are recognised immediately in the income statement even if those gains would normally be recognised directly in reserves.
On the discontinuance of hedge accounting, any adjustment made to the carrying amount of the hedged item as a consequence of the fair value hedge relationship, is recognised in the income statement over the remaining life of the hedged item.
Foreign currencies Trading results are translated at transaction rates for the year.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of trading results and monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency net investments and foreign currency borrowings, or forward contracts used to hedge those investments, are taken to a translation reserve.
They are recycled and recognised as a profit or loss on the disposal or closure of a business.
The cumulative translation difference for all foreign operations was deemed to be zero as at the date of transition to adopted IFRS.
AMEC plc annual report 2005 73 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued Impairment The carrying values of all of the groups assets other than inventories, balances on construction contracts and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If there are indications of an impairment in the carrying value then the recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
For goodwill and assets not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Goodwill was tested for impairment as at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to adopted IFRS, even though no indication of impairment existed.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired by the group, which include software, customer relationships, trademarks and order backlogs are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The cost of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is its fair value at the acquisition date.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, from the date they are available for use.
The estimated lives used range from less than one year to ten years.
Interest Net financing costs comprise interest payable, interest receivable on funds invested and foreign exchange gains and losses.
Interest income and interest payable are recognised in profit or loss as they accrue.
Directly attributable finance costs are capitalised in the cost of purchased and constructed property, plant and equipment, until the relevant assets are brought into operational use.
The only material projects where this has occurred are in the groups investments in joint ventures which are involved in PPP projects to finance, design and build assets and operate them on behalf of the client.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Leases Operating lease costs are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Property, plant and equipment Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, with the exception of freehold land, at rates calculated to write-off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life.
Reviews are made annually of the estimated remaining lives and residual values of individual assets.
The estimated lives used are: Freehold buildings Up to 50 years Leasehold land and buildings The shorter of the lease term or 50 years Plant and equipment Mainly three to five years Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, excluding value added tax, for goods and services supplied to external customers.
It includes the groups share of revenue from work carried out under jointly controlled operations.
Revenue from services and construction contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract, as set out in the accounting policy for construction and other long-term contracts.
Revenue from developments activities is recognised on completion of a signed sale agreement.
Share-based payments There is a share option programme which allows AMEC employees to acquire options over shares of AMEC: these option awards are granted by AMEC.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where non-vesting is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities recognised in the accounts and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
74 AMEC plc annual report 2005 2 Segmental analysis Geographical origin The business and financial review is based on the reported results before IAS 39, joint venture tax, intangible amortisation and pre-tax exceptional items, but including joint venture profit before tax.
The results as presented in the business and financial review are reconciled in the tables on pages 41 to 44 to those presented in this note.
The analysis of total revenue by geographical market is not materially different from that by geographical origin.
There is no revenue from transactions between geographic segments.
Corporate costs comprise the costs of operating the head office of AMEC and also certain regional overheads.
These are not directly related to the activities of the segments.
The financing of the groups activities is undertaken at a head office level and consequently net financing costs cannot be analysed segmentally.
The unallocated net assets principally comprise assets relating to the pension schemes, and liabilities relating to dividends and taxation and are not directly related to the activities of the segments.

Project Solutions Provision has been made for the costs of withdrawing from certain loss-making construction markets in the UK and US.
The exit from US construction management activities was announced in May 2004 and actions to close this business are well advanced.
However, AMEC continues to be involved in protracted, long standing, litigation in respect of certain contracts.
In view of the slow progress in resolution of these disputes, and following a review of the costs of exiting this business, a further provision has been raised.

AMEC plc annual report 2005 81 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 12 Interest in joint ventures and other investments continued An analysis of the groups interests in the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of joint ventures was as follows: Total Total 2005 2004 million million Current assets 591.6 464.1 Long-term assets 274.7 245.6 Current liabilities 158.5 69.1 Long-term liabilities 622.8 565.0 Group share of net assets 85.0 75.6 Income 192.2 158.9 Expenses 178.9 148.5 Share of profits before tax 13.3 10.4 Tax 2.8 2.4 Share of post-tax results of joint ventures 10.5 8.0 The joint ventures have no significant contingent liabilities to which the group is exposed.
AMEC has provided guarantees in respect of committed bank facilities to certain property joint ventures and there are commitments to invest equity in certain joint venture projects.
These guarantees and commitments are set out in note 28.
PPP service concessions Included within the above analysis are joint venture entities of the group which operate a number of UK Government PPP concession contracts.
There is a high degree of certainty on these project cash flows with revenue subject to inflation indexation.
In all cases the concession requires construction of an asset for the public sector client and, with one exception, residual rights remain with the client.
The concessions are in: Transport, where the concessions operate on a shadow toll arrangement or an availability fee, with an unexpired concession period ranging between 21 and 31 years.
One project reached financial close in the year.
Accommodation, with contracts which are subject to an availability fee with unexpired concession periods ranging between 23 and 37 years.
One of these projects has a break clause exercisable in 22 years time and, in another, the residual rights to the asset revert to AMEC rather than the client.
Water treatment, where there is one project which is subject to an availability fee with an unexpired concession period of 25 years.
In Korea, the Incheon Bridge project, for which AMEC has a project management role, reached financial close during the year.
This is a toll project in partnership with the Korean Government and the concession term is 30 years.
13 Other non-current receivables 2005 2004 million million Other receivables 24.0 21.5 82 AMEC plc annual report 2005 14 Retirement benefit assets and liabilities The group operates a number of pension schemes for UK and overseas employees.
Substantially all UK members are in funded defined benefit schemes, the main schemes being the AMEC Staff Pension Scheme, the AMEC Executive Pension Scheme and the AMEC Rail Section of the Railways Pension Scheme.
The majority of overseas members are in defined contribution schemes.
Certain employees in France are members of an unfunded defined benefit scheme.
Defined benefit schemes The valuations used have been based on the most recent valuations of the three major UK schemes as at 31 December 2004 and 1 April 2005, and updated by the schemes actuaries for the requirement to assess the present value of the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 December 2005.
The assets of the schemes are stated at their aggregate market value as at 31 December.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries in relation to the main UK schemes are as follows: 2005 2004 Per cent Per cent Rate of discount 4.9 5.3 Rate of inflation 2.8 2.7 Rate of increase in salaries 3.8 3.8 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.8 2.8 Expected rate of return on scheme assets: Equities 7.6 7.5 Bonds 4.4 5.3 Property 6.1 6.5 Other 4.5 4.5 For the main UK pension schemes, the assumed life expectancy for a male female currently aged 60 is 23 26 years.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The fair values of the schemes assets by category, and the amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 2005 2004 million million Equity instruments 707.9 620.4 Debt instruments 449.6 422.6 Property 102.9 88.8 Cash 27.6 29.7 Fair value of scheme assets 1,288.0 1,161.5 Present value of funded obligations 1,213.3 1,042.6 Present value of unfunded obligations 56.2 52.3 Net asset recognised in the balance sheet 18.5 66.6 The net asset is presented in the balance sheet as: Retirement benefit assets 74.7 118.9 Retirement benefit liabilities 56.2 52.3 Retirement benefit net asset 18.5 66.6 The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2005 2004 million million Current service cost 29.7 31.4 Interest cost 50.7 48.5 Expected return on scheme assets 69.9 69.5 Total expense included within staff costs note 6 10.5 10.4 The expense is recognised in the income statement as follows: Cost of sales 6.9 6.9 Administrative expenses 3.6 3.5 10.5 10.4 AMEC plc annual report 2005 83 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 14 Retirement benefit assets and liabilities continued The movement in the scheme net asset during the year is as follows: 2005 2004 million million Scheme net asset as at 1 January 66.6 69.9 Foreign exchange 1.2 Total expense as above 10.5 10.4 Contributions paid 22.8 17.2 Liabilities acquired through business combinations 4.9 Actuarial losses recognised in reserves 56.7 10.1 Scheme net asset as at 31 December 18.5 66.6 The actual return on scheme assets is as follows: 2005 2004 million million Actual return on scheme assets 200.7 97.3 Experience and other adjustments arising on scheme assets and liabilities are as follows: 2005 2004 million million Experience adjustments arising on scheme assets 130.8 27.8 Experience adjustments arising on scheme liabilities 27.3 0.7 Changes in assumptions 160.2 37.2 56.7 10.1 15 Deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities Assets Liabilities Net 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 million million million million million million Property, plant and equipment 6.6 2.7 3.7 6.6 1.0 Intangible assets 2.9 0.3 2.9 0.3 Retirement benefits 15.5 16.2 19.4 35.6 3.9 19.4 Derivative financial instruments 6.3 6.3 Provisions 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.8 Other items 20.2 18.7 24.8 22.5 4.6 3.8 Tax losses carried forward 20.5 22.6 20.5 22.6 Deferred tax assets liabilities 70.9 62.0 47.1 62.1 23.8 0.1 Transfers 16.5 16.5 Net deferred tax assets liabilities 70.9 45.5 47.1 45.6 23.8 0.1 84 AMEC plc annual report 2005 15 Deferred tax assets and liabilities continued Movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year As at Exchange As at 1 January and other Recognised Recognised Recognised 31 December 2005 movements on acquisition in income in equity 2005 million million million million million million Property, plant and equipment 1.0 7.6 6.6 Intangible assets 0.3 2.9 0.3 2.9 Employee benefits 19.4 1.5 17.0 3.9 Derivative financial instruments 4.9 1.4 6.3 Provisions 1.8 1.8 Other items 3.8 0.1 0.9 4.6 Tax losses carried forward 22.6 1.3 3.4 20.5 4.8 1.3 2.8 2.1 18.4 23.8 As at Exchange As at 1 January and other Recognised Recognised Recognised 31 December 2004 movements on acquisition in income in equity 2004 million million million million million million Property, plant and equipment 1.3 0.3 1.0 Intangible assets 0.3 0.3 Employee benefits 23.4 0.7 3.3 19.4 Provisions 1.8 1.8 Other items 15.6 1.7 17.7 3.8 Tax losses carried forward 9.8 0.2 13.0 22.6 2.2 1.9 3.7 3.3 0.1 Deferred tax assets and liabilities in respect of financial instruments as at 1 January 2005 have been restated for the effect of adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items: 2005 2004 million million Deductible temporary differences 16.3 23.8 Tax losses 70.0 79.1 86.3 102.9 Tax losses of 33.0 million arising in Canada and unrecognised by the group expire between 2008 and 2024.
The other tax losses and deductible temporary differences not recognised by the group do not expire under current tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that profit will be available in the near term against which the group can utilise the benefits therefrom.

Designated hedging arrangements are described below.
As explained in note 1, AMEC elected not to adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39 in its restated financial information for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Consequently, the fair values of derivative financial instruments as at 31 December 2004 as set out in note 31 are not recognised in the 2004 balance sheet.
Hedging of interest rate risk The group uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its floating rate debt to fixed and vice versa.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of swaps designated as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges as at 31 December 2005 are as follows: 2005 2005 Notional Carrying amount contract amount and fair value million million Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges: Non-current liabilities 226.0 10.2 Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges: Non-current liabilities 17.5 1.9 The swaps designated as cash flow hedges mature over the next six years following the maturity of the related loans and have fixed swap rates ranging from 3.6 per cent to 5.4 per cent.
Hedging of foreign currency risk forecast transactions The group looks to mitigate the foreign exchange risk typically arising where contracts are awarded in, or involve costs in non-local currency.
Forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps are used for this purpose and designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of swaps and forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges as at 31 December 2005 are as follows: 2005 2005 Notional Carrying amount contract amount and fair value million million Current assets 79.3 0.4 Current liabilities 64.9 2.0 Non-current liabilities 13.7 0.9 157.9 2.5 AMEC plc annual report 2005 87 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 21 Financial instruments continued The forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges mature predominantly over the next twelve months, in line with the hedged cash flows.
Certain forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps are not designated as cash flow hedges and changes in their fair value are recognised through the income statement.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of these swaps and forward contracts as at 31 December 2005 are as follows: 2005 2005 Notional Carrying amount contract amount and fair value million million Current assets 46.6 0.4 Current liabilities 48.0 1.3 94.6 0.9 Hedging of foreign currency risk net investment hedges The group has Euro, Canadian dollar, and US dollar denominated borrowings which are designated as hedges of the net investments in its subsidiaries in France, Canada and the US.
The carrying amounts of these borrowings as at 31 December are as follows: 2005 million Borrowings denominated in: Euro 160.8 Canadian dollars 68.8 US dollars 67.0 296.6 A net foreign exchange loss for the year of 12.0 million was recognised in the translation reserve in respect of these borrowings.
Interest rate risk contractual maturity and repricing dates and effective interest rates In respect of interest-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they mature or are repriced if earlier than maturity: 2005 Effective More interest 6 months 6-12 1-2 2-5 than 5 rate Total or less months years years years % million million million million million million Debt securities held-to-maturity 3.2 7.7 0.1 0.1 0.3 7.2 Cash and cash equivalents 2.4 351.9 351.9 Unsecured bank loans: Sterling floating rate loan 5.0 225.0 225.0 Effect of interest rate swaps 0.3 110.0 110.0 Euro floating rate loan 3.0 172.4 172.4 Effect of interest rate swaps 1.6 37.8 37.8 Canadian dollar floating rate loan 3.6 68.8 68.8 Effect of interest rate swaps 1.7 12.5 12.5 Unsecured bonds: Sterling fixed rate bonds 5.9 45.0 45.0 US dollar fixed rate bonds 5.1 67.0 23.3 43.7 Effect of interest rate swaps 17.4 17.4 Bank overdrafts Sterling overdraft 5.5 6.7 6.7 Euro overdraft 2.5 12.5 12.5 Other payables: Euro floating rate payable 2.8 65.8 65.8 Effect of interest rate swaps 2.5 65.8 65.8 303.6 9.4 0.1 160.2 23.0 129.9 88 AMEC plc annual report 2005 21 Financial instruments continued Credit risk Trade receivable exposures are typically with large publicly quoted companies and government backed organisations, and the credit ratings of these organisations are monitored.
Credit risks are minimised through the use of letters of credit, parent company guarantees, insurance instruments and forward funding where achievable.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments recorded in the balance sheet.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk at the balance sheet date.
Fair values The fair values together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet are as follows: Carrying amount Fair value 2005 2005 million million Non-current other receivables 24.0 24.0 Current trade and other receivables 1,884.2 1,884.2 Interest rate swaps: Liabilities 12.1 12.1 Forward exchange contracts: Assets 0.8 0.8 Liabilities 4.2 4.2 Cash and cash equivalents 351.9 351.9 Bank overdrafts 19.2 19.2 Unsecured bank loans 466.2 466.2 Unsecured bonds 112.0 117.4 Current trade and other payables 2,007.7 2,007.7 Non-current trade and other payables 73.7 73.7 Fair values are determined as follows: Trade and other receivables and payables are valued at their notional amounts, which are deemed to reflect fair value.
Interest rate swaps are valued using appropriate zero coupon valuation techniques based on rates current at the year end.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are valued based on market spot rates at the year end and zero coupon valuation techniques.
Bank loans and bonds are valued based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Securitisation AMEC SPIE operates a securitisation programme whereby a proportion of trade receivables, totalling 89.3 million as at 31 December 2005, were sold to a special purpose vehicle.
Under the terms of the scheme, the recourse to AMEC SPIE is capped at 10 per cent of the receivables which have been sold and therefore AMEC SPIEs continuing involvement of 8.9 million as at 31 December 2005 is included within bank loans.
The net impact of the securitisation programme has been to reduce net assets attributed to each of the ETS segment and the Rest of Europe by 89.3 million.

The maturity of the financial liabilities was as follows: 2004 million Group: Due: In one year or less, or on demand 50.3 Between one and two years 70.6 Between two and five years 424.5 Over five years 146.1 691.5 There was no material difference between the book and fair value of financial assets and liabilities save for financial liabilities in the two to five years category which had a book value of 424.5 million and a fair value of 343.8 million as at 31 December 2004 and those in the over five years category which had a book value of 146.1 million and 116.0 million respectively as at 31 December 2004.
As at 31 December 2004, there were six outstanding interest rate swaps under which the group paid a fixed rate of interest and received a floating rate based on six months LIBOR.
The instruments covered US dollars, Canadian dollars, Euro and Sterling, and had a Sterling equivalent of 65.0 million.
The expiry dates ranged from January 2005 to January 2008, with a weighted average period to maturity of 29 months as at 31 December 2004.
In addition, there were two outstanding interest rate swaps under which the group paid a floating rate of interest and received a fixed rate.
The instruments covered US dollars with a Sterling equivalent of 15.6 million and expire in July 2013.
After taking into account the effects of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, there were no material currency exposures in respect of monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the relevant business unit.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging purposes were not recognised until the exposure that was being hedged was recognised in either the income statement or via an adjustment to the carrying value of an asset on the balance sheet.
There were no material unrecognised gains or losses at the beginning or end of the year.
As permitted by FRS 13, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the above analyses.

As discussed in the business and financial review on page 48 and in line with counsels opinion, the excess of the proceeds of the placing over the nominal value of the shares issued created a merger reserve which was subsequently transferred to retained earnings and is available for distribution to shareholders.
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the accounts of foreign operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the companys net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
A qualifying share ownership trust the Quest was established on 26 August 1999.
The Quest holds shares issued by the company in connection with the savings related share option scheme.
During the year the company allotted 126,524 2004: 2,538,668 shares to the Quest and the Quest transferred 191,662 2004: 3,140,312 of these shares to employees exercising options.

AMEC plc annual report 2005 91 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 23 Share capital and reserves continued Share-based payment In 1985, the group established the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which entitles employees of the group to buy shares in the company.
Grants of share options under this scheme are offered to employees periodically, and options are exercisable at a 20 per cent discount to the market price of shares at the date of grant.
Under the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002, directors and senior employees of the group have been granted share options, which carry a non-market based performance condition.
Until September 2004, the Performance Share Plan 2002 was operated alongside the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002, but since then awards have been made under the Performance Share Plan 2002 only.
Under this plan, share awards are made to directors and senior employees of the group, subject to both market and non-market based performance tests.
All of the share-based payment arrangements operated by the group are equity-settled.
Options are granted with a maximum term of ten years.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 and IFRS 2 Share-based payment, the recognition and measurement provisions of IFRS 2 have not been applied to options granted or shares awarded before 7 November 2002.
The number and weighted average exercise price of share options under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme and the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002 are as follows: Weighted Weighted average average exercise Number exercise Number price of options price of options 2005 2005 2004 2004 pence pence Outstanding on 1 January 240 14,389,582 222 16,115,303 Lapsed 250 2,009,880 225 916,173 Exercised 129 846,662 221 3,348,274 Granted 279 5,905,729 320 2,538,726 Outstanding on 31 December 257 17,438,769 240 14,389,582 Exercisable on 31 December 205 2,468,967 122 1,155,965 Options were exercised on a regular basis during the year, and the weighted average share price for the year was 335 pence 2004: 291 pence.

The performance conditions attaching to the Performance Share Plan 2002 involve a comparison of the total shareholder return of the company with that of its comparators and achievement of targeted earnings per share growth.
The former is a market based test and as such is incorporated into the grant date fair value of the award.
Goodwill written-off against reserves The cumulative goodwill at historic exchange rates written-off against reserves in respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998, when FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets was adopted, amounts to 200.2 million 2004: 200.2 million.

The directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ending 31 December 2005 of 7.5 pence per share, which will absorb an estimated 24.3 million of equity.
Subject to approval, it will be paid on 3 July 2006 to shareholders on the register of members on 12 May 2006.
The dividends have not been provided for and there are no income tax consequences for the company.

25 Acquisitions and disposals All acquisitions in the year have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.
An assessment of the fair value to the group of the assets and liabilities acquired on all acquisitions has been made.
On 20 January 2005, the group acquired all the shares in Paragon Engineering Services Inc. Paragon for 21.7 million.
Paragon is an oil and gas engineering services company based in Houston, US.
The amounts recognised in respect of identifiable assets and liabilities relating to the acquisition of Paragon were as follows: Fair value Recognised Book value adjustments value million million million Property, plant and equipment 1.2 0.3 0.9 Intangible assets 4.9 4.9 Trade and other receivables 7.7 7.7 Cash and cash equivalents 4.2 4.2 Deferred tax liability 0.7 0.7 Trade and other payables 4.3 4.3 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 8.8 3.9 12.7 Goodwill on acquisition 9.6 22.3 Consideration Cash 17.2 Deferred consideration 4.5 21.7 Cost of acquisition 0.6 22.3 In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2005, Paragon contributed 45.5 million to the consolidated revenue.
Its profit contribution was not material to the results of the group.
Goodwill has been recognised on the acquisition of Paragon as a result of its skilled workforce and specialist engineering expertise that did not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset at the date of acquisition.
94 AMEC plc annual report 2005 25 Acquisitions and disposals continued On 3 July 2005, the group acquired all the shares in NNC Holdings Limited NNC for 25.3 million in cash and net debt of 13.7 million.
NNC provides consultancy and engineering services across the life of nuclear facilities in the UK, Canada and across the former Soviet Union.
The amounts recognised in respect of identifiable assets and liabilities relating to the acquisition of NNC were as follows: Fair value Recognised Book value adjustments value million million million Property, plant and equipment 4.4 1.7 2.7 Intangible assets 9.4 2.0 7.4 Inventories 8.5 8.5 Trade and other receivables 21.0 3.4 17.6 Cash and cash equivalents 1.4 1.4 Bank loans and overdrafts 14.6 0.5 15.1 Trade and other payables 26.1 2.3 28.4 Deferred tax liability 2.1 2.1 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 4.0 12.0 8.0 Goodwill on acquisition 34.1 26.1 Consideration Cash 25.3 Cost of acquisition 0.8 26.1 In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2005, NNC contributed 50.6 million to the consolidated revenue.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of NNC primarily because of its skilled workforce which did not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset at the date of acquisition.
A number of smaller acquisitions were made in the year ended 31 December 2005 for an aggregate consideration net of cash acquired of 8.7 million of which 4.3 million was paid in 2004.
The aggregate book value of the identifiable assets and liabilities was 0.2 million and the aggregate goodwill arising on the acquisitions was 12.4 million.
The acquisition cost of joint ventures and other investments amounted to 25.0 million in 2005 and principally related to investments in public private partnership projects.
26 Capital commitments 2005 2004 million million Contracted but not provided for in the accounts 0.3 1.2 As at 31 December 2005, there was a commitment to invest a total of 42.3 million 2003: 36.0 million in various Public Private and regeneration partnership projects.
In addition, there are commitments to purchase land for a developments project of up to 15 million over the next ten years.
27 Operating leases The total obligations under non-cancellable operating lease rentals are as follows: 2005 2004 million million In one year or less 31.9 33.8 Between one and five years 84.5 67.8 Over five years 47.3 51.7 163.7 153.3 AMEC plc annual report 2005 95 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 28 Contingent liabilities Guarantees and indemnities The borrowings of joint ventures are generally without recourse to AMEC other than for normal performance obligations which are usually given on a several basis.
AMEC has provided guarantees in respect of committed bank facilities granted to certain property joint ventures.
The borrowings drawn against these facilities amounted to 33.8 million at 31 December 2005 2004: 35.0 million and the current debt service ratios for these joint ventures are all within the agreed levels.
The company and certain subsidiaries have given counter indemnities in respect of performance bonds issued, on behalf of group companies, in the normal course of business.
As at 31 December 2005, AMEC had a commitment to invest 47.4 million 2004: 36.0 million in joint venture projects.
It had also provided guarantees on certain projects to invest further amounts of up to 34.2 million 2003: 16.4 million, AMEC believes that the circumstances under which it will be called upon to invest the contingent equity are remote.
Legal claims and actions AMEC has taken internal and external legal advice in considering known legal claims and actions made by or against the company.
Consequently, it carefully assesses the likelihood of the success of a claim or action including those identified in this note.
AMEC makes an appropriate provision for those legal claims or actions against the company on the basis of the likely outcome, but makes no provision for those which are, in its view, unlikely to succeed.
During 1994 and 1995, AMEC Construction Management Inc. ACMI, a wholly owned subsidiary of AMEC plc, entered into various contracts with the United States General Services Administration GSA for the construction of courthouses in Missouri and California and for the refurbishment and seismic upgrade of a US Customs House in California.
The total value of these contracts at point of signing was in the order of US$290 million.
Due, inter alia, to unforeseen site conditions, client delays and numerous design and scope changes, ACMI suffered significant cost overruns and submitted substantial recovery claims.
In June 1999, GSA terminated the right of ACMI to complete one contract, which at that stage was 85 per cent complete.
ACMI contested the termination and sued the GSA for recovery of all claims on this contract.
Recently the GSA has submitted its claim against ACMI for reprocurement and other costs totalling US$32 million.
The United States Department of Justice then filed a counterclaim alleging false claims on the GSA contracts and sought to argue that, as a result, ACMI had forfeited its rights to recovery of all claims.
ACMI, upon legal advice, pleaded guilty in December 2000 and November 2001 to two federal felonies and paid two fines totalling approximately US$1.2 million.
AMEC also agreed to introduce additional ethical processes and procedures, both for the North American workforce and for those staff employed by AMEC, whose responsibilities caused them to have regular business contact with AMEC Americas and thus, the US Government.
The GSA subsequently filed a motion for summary judgement seeking an order declaring that ACMI had forfeited its claims on all the projects.
ACMI opposed the motion and oral argument was held in February 2004.
During 2005 the US Court of Federal Claims ruled that ACMI had violated the US Anti-Kickback Act.
The Court has stated that it intends to issue an order in respect of the Governments counter claims and the issues relating to the Anti-Kickback Act in April 2006.
In 2001, ACMI entered into a contract with a value of US$103 million to build a development in Miami, Florida, which was subject to significant changes and design delays.
In January 2006 the client terminated ACMIs contract despite having taken possession of the majority of the facility for many months.
Both parties are now in litigation in pursuit of various claims and counter claims.
In 2000, ACMI entered into a contract with a value of US$115 million to design and build a jail for the City and County of San Francisco CCSF.
Due to unforeseen conditions, delays and interference with ACMIs design, procurement and execution of the work, ACMI suffered large cost overruns.
In 2005, lawsuits were filed by both parties.
CCSF further alleged that ACMI made false claims in connection with the project and also failed to properly maintain its California contractors licence throughout the project term.
The litigation is at the pleading stages with an initial trial date set for November 2007.
In 1999 AGRA Monenco Inc. a predecessor company of AMEC Americas Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of AMEC plc, in joint venture, entered into a contract with Jordan Magnesia Company Ltd. Jormag to design and construct a magnesium plant in Jordan with a contract value of US$80 million.
The joint venture experienced delays in completing its work under the contract and Jormag terminated the contract when work was approximately 95 per cent complete.
The joint venture commenced an action against Jormag, who counter claimed for damages it claims it suffered from the alleged default of the joint venture.
The dispute has been referred to arbitration under the terms of the contract, and the matter is scheduled to be heard by a panel in the UK in March 2006.
96 AMEC plc annual report 2005 28 Contingent liabilities continued After the terrorist attacks in September 2001, ACMI was one of four construction managers hired by the City of New York to carry out the clean up and debris removal work at the World Trade Center site.
The client was responsible for procuring insurance to protect the construction managers and various contractors from lawsuits arising out of the work.
The World Trade Center Captive Insurance Company the WTC Captive was formed and was funded with US$1 billion in Federal money to provide coverage for the City, the construction managers and the contractors who performed the work on site.
Pursuant to the insurance policy that was issued, the WTC Captive is providing a minimum of US$1 billion in insurance coverage.
This amount can increase depending upon investment returns on the US$1 billion.
The WTC Captive is providing a defence and indemnification for claims against ACMI arising out of this work.
AMEC Civil Engineering Limited was awarded a contract to refurbish the existing Thelwall viaduct which carries the M6 motorway over the Manchester Ship Canal.
Shortly prior to the expiry of the six year latent defects liability period the Highways Agency advised AMEC that a number of bearings bearing plates had failed.
Subsequently the Highways Agency decided to replace all the 316 bearings and has raised a claim against AMEC for 48 million.
The client has instigated a dispute under the contract which has been referred to arbitration.
The hearing is not anticipated until 2007.
29 Related party transactions During the year there were a number of transactions with the senior management group, joint venture entities and subsidiary companies.
Transactions with the senior management group Directors of the company and their immediate relatives control 0.1 per cent of the voting rights of the company.
In addition to their salaries, the group and company also provide non-cash benefits to directors and executive officers, and contribute to a postemployment defined benefit plan on their behalf.
Directors and executive officers also receive share awards under the Performance Share Plan.
Details of the senior management group compensation are as follows: 2005 million Short-term employee benefits 1.0 Post-employment benefits 0.2 Share-based payment 0.4 1.6 The transactions and related balances outstanding with joint ventures entities are as follows: Value of transactions Outstanding balance in the year as at 31 December 2005 2004 2005 2004 million million million million Services rendered 12.6 59.6 3.9 6.5 Services received 4.5 3.0 0.3 Sale of property, plant and equipment 43.9 29.7 Provision of finance 26.2 18.0 7.9 AMEC Developments Limited and AMEC Staff Pensions Trustee Limited entered into an agreement on 23 December 2005 for the sale of the long leasehold interests forming part of the Newcastle Estate, currently owned by AMEC Developments Limited, to AMEC Staff Pensions Trustee Limited, for a price of 25 million.
The agreement was conditional upon various consents being obtained and ancillary documentation being entered into.
It is envisaged that the conditions will be satisfied shortly.
AMEC Developments Limited and AMEC Staff Pensions Trustee Limited have each received separate legal and valuation advice in respect of the transaction.
30 Post balance sheet event As previously announced, the group is continuing with the proposed sale of AMEC SPIE.
The assets to be disposed of include Continental European Rail, Multitechnical and Oil and Gas Services activities, excluding the pipeline business.
The UK Rail business will be subject to a joint venture and will be held 50 per cent by AMEC plc and 50 per cent will be disposed of along with AMEC SPIE.
The sales process has commenced and the Information Memorandum will be issued in March.
The group is expecting to seek shareholder approval for the sale process around the middle of the year.
Total profit before net finance costs relating to the business subject to the disposal process amounted to 49.7 million in 2005.
The majority of this is included in the Engineering and Technical Services segment, although small elements also relate to Oil and Gas and Project Solutions.
AMEC plc annual report 2005 97 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 31 Explanation of transition to IFRS As stated in note 1, these are the groups first consolidated accounts prepared in accordance with adopted IFRS.
The accounting policies set out in note 1 have been applied in preparing the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2005, the comparative information presented in these accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004 and in the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004, the groups date of transition.
Transitional arrangements The rules for first time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS 1.
In general, a company is required to define its IFRS accounting policies and apply these retrospectively to determine its opening consolidated balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 under IFRS.
To assist companies in their transition to reporting under IFRS, IFRS 1 sets out various exceptions and exemptions from this principle of full retrospective adoption.
The exemptions that AMEC has applied under IFRS 1 are discussed below.
As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, AMEC elected to adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39, prospectively from 1 January 2005.
The 2004 comparative figures have not been restated to comply with these standards.
The effect of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 on the balance sheet as at 1 January 2005 is set out on page 103.

11.4 7.2 1.9 39.5 307.6 The impacts of significant changes in policy, which have arisen from AMECs transition to IFRS, on the companys results and financial position are discussed below: Balance sheet reclassifications There are a number of reclassifications between balance sheet captions that arise from the application of various IFRS.
IFRS 2 Share-based payment Under UK GAAP, there was no charge to the income statement in respect of Save As You Earn schemes that were offered on similar terms to all, or substantially all, UK employees.
For other share option schemes, there was a charge only in respect of the difference between the market price on the date of grant and the exercise price of the option i. e. there was no charge in respect of options issued at market price.
For shares issued under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Performance Share Plan 2002 PSP, there was a charge to the profit and loss account equal to the market price of the shares on the date of the award, spread over the performance period.
IFRS 2 requires the fair value of all equity instruments granted to be charged to the income statement over the performance period of the award.
This results in a charge in respect of all share options issued, and a different basis for calculation of the charge in respect of the LTIP and PSP.
As permitted by IFRS 1, AMEC has applied IFRS 2 only to those equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
The impact of this is to reduce profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 by 1.8 million, together with an associated tax credit of 0.5 million.
IFRS 3 Business combinations Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions made post 1 January 1998 was capitalised and amortised, on a straight line basis, over its estimated useful economic life.
Under IFRS 3, positive goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life and consequently is not amortised, but instead is subject to impairment testing both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable in full.
Goodwill previously written-off to reserves is no longer recycled to the income statement on the disposal or closure of operations as it would have been under UK GAAP.
As permitted by IFRS 1, AMEC has applied IFRS 3 prospectively from the transition date, rather than restating all previous business combinations.
The impact of IFRS 3 on AMEC is as follows: the amortisation of goodwill is reversed increasing profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 by 21.6 million.
the goodwill recycled to the income statement on the disposal or closure, of operations in 2004 is frozen in reserves.
This increases profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 by 13.0 million.
AMEC plc annual report 2005 101 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 31 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date Under UK GAAP, dividends declared after the period end are recognised as a liability of the company at the balance sheet date.
Under IAS 10, dividends declared after the period end represent a non-adjusting post balance sheet event and therefore no liability is recognised at the balance sheet date.
Consequently, there is an adjustment as at 31 December 2004 to remove the liability of 23.5 million in respect of the 2004 final dividend 2003: 20.2 million.
IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment Under UK GAAP, AMECs policy was to revalue freehold and long leasehold property on a regular basis.
Under IAS 16, AMEC has opted to carry property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
As permitted by IFRS 1, AMEC has frozen the UK GAAP land and buildings revaluations as at 1 January 2004 by ascribing the carrying value as deemed cost.
The impact of this change in policy is as follows: the revaluation reserve is reclassified into retained earnings as at the date of transition: the results of the external revaluation as at 31 December 2004 are reversed, reducing the value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2004 by 9.6 million: and as part of the 2004 external revaluation, certain properties were revalued downwards.
Under UK GAAP, these deficits were charged against previous revaluations held in the revaluation reserve.
Under IFRS, these downward revaluations have been taken as indicators that the value of the relevant properties is impaired and as such, they have been charged to the income statement as impairment charges in 2004.
This reduces the profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 and the value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2004 by 1.8 million.
IAS 19 Employee benefits Under UK GAAP, AMEC accounted for pension costs by spreading the cost of providing the benefits, including any experience gains or losses, over the estimated average service lives of the employees.
Under IAS 19, AMECs policy is now to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the statement of recognised income and expense as they arise.
This is permitted by the amended version of IAS 19.
The impact of IAS 19 is to increase the pensions charge for the year ended 31 December 2004 by 2.6 million.
There is a related tax credit of 0.7 million.
The implementation of IAS 19 results in an increase in the net assets of 7.2 million as at 31 December 2004 2003: 15.9 million.
IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates IAS 21 requires that exchange differences arising on the re-translation of foreign currency net investments and foreign currency borrowings are taken to a separate component of equity.
On the disposal of an operation, such gains or losses are recycled to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
As permitted by IFRS 1, AMEC has deemed the cumulative translation differences to be zero at the date of transition.
IAS 38 Intangible assets IAS 38 requires that certain expenditure relating to software be capitalised as an intangible asset.
Certain items that were capitalised, in accordance with UK GAAP, no longer qualify for capitalisation under IAS 38 and these items have been written-off at the date of transition.
This reduces the net assets as at 31 December 2003 by 1.4 million.
In addition, certain assets that were included within goodwill under UK GAAP are reclassified as other intangible assets and, consequently, are amortised at a different rate, reducing profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 by 0.5 million.
Cash flow statement Under IAS 7 Cash flow statements, movements in cash and cash equivalents are reconciled: under UK GAAP the statement reconciles cash only.
The change in presentation of the cash flow statement under IAS 7 makes no difference to the free cash generated by the group.
102 AMEC plc annual report 2005 31 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Application of IAS 32 and IAS 39 prospectively from 1 January 2005 Prior to the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, the group did not recognise derivatives.
In accordance with IAS 39, derivatives have been recorded at fair value with effect from 1 January 2005 and these principally relate to interest and inflation rate derivatives in the PPP projects.
The effect of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 on the group balance sheet as at 1 January 2005 is as follows: Adjustment million ASSETS Non-current assets Interests in joint ventures 12.9 Other receivables 3.7 Deferred tax assets 4.1 Current assets Derivative financial instruments 3.5 LIABILITIES Current liabilities Trade and other payables 1.0 Derivative financial instruments 6.1 Non-current liabilities Derivative financial instruments 8.8 Deferred tax liabilities 0.8 Net assets 22.1 EQUITY Hedging and translation reserves 17.7 Retained earnings 4.4 Total equity 22.1 AMEC plc annual report 2005 103
