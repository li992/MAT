During the year the company issued a further 75m of bonds with maturity dates of 50m on 28 September 2013 and 25m on 28 September 2015 with an interest rate set at 0.525% above six month LIBOR.
The previous bond issue was in the form of 55m sterling, and US Dollars amounts of $66m and $36m.
These issues mature on 20 June 2009, 20 June 2009, and 20 June 2012 and are issued at interest rates of 6.44%, 6.1% and 6.47% respectively.
The company entered into cross currency swaps for the US dollar issues swapping the $66m and $36m bonds into a sterling denominated long term loan of 70m and an interest rate swap for the sterling issue, the maturity dates being the same as for the issues themselves.
Issue costs incurred were 0.5m and these are being spread over the life of the bonds to their maturity.
The effect of this interest rate swap is to convert the interest cost on the bond to 6 month LIBOR plus 1%.
