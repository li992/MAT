Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31st December 2005 60 2004 Financial instruments FRS 13 The Groups objectives and policies in managing the risks that arise in connection with the use of financial instruments are set out in Note 54 under the heading Financial Risk Management.
Short-term debtors and creditors are included in the following interest rate repricing and non-trading currency risk tables.
Interest rate sensitivity gap analysis The table below summarises the repricing profiles of the Groups non-trading book as at 31st December 2004.
Items are allocated to time bands by reference to the earlier of the next contractual interest rate repricing date and the maturity date.

The Groups structural currency exposures at 31st December 2004 were as follows: 2004 Net Borrowings Remaining investments which hedge structural in overseas the net currency operations investments exposures Functional currency of the operation involved m m m US Dollar 2,050 2,038 12 Yen 2,594 2,589 5 Euro 3,148 3,102 46 Other non-Sterling 753 332 421 Total 8,545 8,061 484 In accordance with Group policy, as at 31st December 2004, there were no material net currency exposures in the non-trading book relating to transactional or non-structural positions that would give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Daily Value at Risk The Daily Value at Risk DVaR methodology of estimating potential losses arising from the Groups exposure to market risk is explained in Note 54 under the heading Market Risk Management.
The models used in estimating potential losses are based on past movements and may not be indicative of future market conditions.
The following table shows an analysis of DVaR for the market risk exposures in Barclays Capital as an average for the year and the high and low during the year.
Year to 31st December 2004 a a Average High Low m m m Interest rate risk 25.0 53.6 15.1 Credit spread risk 22.6 32.9 16.0 Foreign exchange risk 2.4 7.4 0.9 Equities risk 4.2 7.9 2.2 Commodities risk 6.0 14.4 2.2 Diversification effect 25.9 b Total DVaR 34.3 46.8 24.0 3.5 Notes a The high and low DVaR figures reported for each category did not necessarily occur on the same day as the high and low DVaR reported as a whole.
A corresponding diversification effect cannot be calculated and is therefore omitted from the above table.
b The year-end total DVaR for 2004 was 31.9m.

The totals of positive and negative fair values arising on trading derivatives at the balance sheet date have been netted where the Group has a legal right of offset with the relevant counterparty.
The total positive fair value after permitted netting equates to net replacement cost.
The residual replacement cost by maturity and net replacement cost by counterparty analyses of OTC and non-margined exchange traded derivatives held for trading and non-trading purposes at 31st December 2004 are as follows: 2004 Over one year but not One year more than Over five or less five years years Total m m m m Replacement cost by residual maturity Foreign exchange derivatives 9,285 6,886 4,320 20,491 Interest rate derivatives 6,121 23,130 34,701 63,952 Equity and stock index derivatives 1,750 2,312 394 4,456 Commodity derivatives 1,791 2,899 265 4,955 Credit derivatives 22 1,098 332 1,452 Total 18,969 36,325 40,012 95,306 2004 m Net replacement cost by counterparty Central Banks 2,563 Banks and other financial institutions 7,043 Other corporate and public bodies 9,552 Total 19,158 Potential credit risk exposure The potential credit risk exposure for each product equals net replacement cost as reduced by the fair value of collateral provided by the counterparty.
At 31st December 2004, the potential credit risk exposures in respect of the Groups trading and non-trading OTC derivatives were not significantly different to net replacement cost.
Fair values of financial instruments Financial instruments include both financial assets and financial liabilities and also derivatives.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
Wherever possible, the Group has estimated fair value using market prices or data available for instruments with characteristics either identical or similar to those of the instruments held by the Group.
In certain cases, however, including loans and advances to customers, no ready markets currently exist in the UK wherein exchanges between willing parties occur.
Accordingly, various techniques have been developed to estimate what the fair value of such instruments might be.
These estimation techniques are necessarily subjective in nature and involve several assumptions.
There have been no significant changes in the estimation techniques or the methodology used compared with those used in the prior year.
Because a variety of estimation techniques are employed and significant estimates made, comparisons of fair values between financial institutions may not be meaningful.
Readers of these accounts are thus advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups financial position.
Fair value information is not provided for items that do not meet the definitions of a financial instrument.
These items include short-term debtors and creditors, intangible assets such as the value of the Groups branch network, the long-term relationships with depositors core deposit intangibles, premises and equipment and shareholders equity.
These items are material and accordingly the fair value information presented does not purport to represent, nor should it be construed to represent, the underlying value of the Group as a going concern at 31st December 2004.
Barclays PLC 234 Annual Report 2005 60 2004 Financial instruments FRS 13 continued The following table shows the carrying amount and the fair value of the Groups financial instruments: 2004 Carrying Fair amount value Notes m m Assets Cash and balances at central banks a 1,753 1,753 Items in course of collection from other banks a 1,772 1,772 Treasury bills and other eligible bills a 6,658 6,658 Loans and advances to banks c 80,632 80,628 Loans and advances to customers d 262,409 262,567 Debt securities e 130,311 130,529 Equity shares e 11,399 11,619 Derivatives b 19,397 21,340 London Metal Exchange warrants and other metals trading positions a 952 952 Liabilities Deposits by Banks and customers accounts f 328,516 328,522 Debt securities in issue g 83,842 83,936 Items in course of collection due to other banks a 1,205 1,205 Undated loan capital h 6,149 6,946 Dated loan capital h 6,128 6,483 Short positions in securities e 53,903 53,904 Derivatives b 19,042 21,041 Notes a Financial assets and financial liabilities where fair value approximates carrying value because they are either i carried at market value or ii have minimal credit losses and are either short-term in nature or repriced frequently.
b Derivatives held for trading purposes are carried at fair value.
Derivatives held for non-trading purposes are accounted for in accordance with the accounting treatment of the underlying transaction or transactions being hedged.
The fair value of these instruments is estimated using market prices or pricing models consistent with the methods used for valuing similar instruments used for trading purposes.
c Within this calculation, the fair value for loans and advances to banks was estimated using discounted cash flows, applying either market rates, where practicable, or rates currently offered by other financial institutions for placings with similar characteristics.
d The Group provides lending facilities of varying rates and maturities to corporate and personal customers.
In estimating the fair value of such instruments, the fair value of personal and corporate loans subject to variable interest rates is considered to approximate the carrying value.
The fair value of such instruments subject to fixed interest rates was eliminated by discounting cash flows using market rates or rates normally offered by the Group.
e The valuation of listed securities and investments is at quoted market prices and that of unlisted securities and investments is based on the Directors estimate, which takes into consideration discounted cash flows, price earnings ratios and other suitable valuation techniques.
f Fair values of deposit liabilities payable on demand interest free, interest bearing and savings deposits approximate their carrying value.
The fair value of all other deposits and other borrowings was estimated using discounted cash flows, applying either market rates, where practicable, or rates currently offered by the Group for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
g Fair values of short-term debt securities in issue are approximately equal to their carrying amount.
Fair values of other debt securities in issue are based on quoted prices where available, or where these are unavailable, are estimated using other valuation techniques.
h The estimated fair values for dated and undated convertible and non-convertible loan capital were based upon quoted market rates for the issue concerned or equivalent issues with similar terms and conditions.
i The Group considers that, given the lack of an established market, the diversity of fee structures and the difficulty of separating the value of the instruments from the value of the overall transaction, it is not meaningful to provide an estimate of the fair value of financial commitments and contingent liabilities.
