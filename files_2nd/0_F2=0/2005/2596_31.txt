Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and replaces the 1994 Scheme.
The LTIP is divided into two parts.
Part A allows the Board to grant share options.
In normal circumstances options granted are only exercisable if the relevant performance condition has been satisfied.
Share options granted to date have a performance condition attached based on the Companys adjusted earnings per share growth relative to UK inflation over three years.
Part B of the LTIP allows the Board to award performance shares which is a conditional right to receive shares in the Company for no or nominal consideration.
A performance share award will normally vest i. e. become exercisable on the third anniversary of its grant to the extent that the applicable performance condition has been satisfied.
The extent to which performance share awards vest will be subject to the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance over a three year period relative to the TSR performance of a specified peer group of companies.
Details of the share schemes and plans operated by the Company are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 44 to 51.
