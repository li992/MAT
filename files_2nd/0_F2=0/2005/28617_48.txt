Contingent liabilities and commitments a The Group is currently carrying out a review of its Rathbone Self Invested Personal Pension Rathbone SIPP business.
The principal aim of the review is to ascertain whether any of the Rathbone SIPPs arranged for clients were unsuitable.
The review was initiated by the Group in 2004: the Groups regulator has been consulted in relation to the approach being adopted.
To date, the review has identified a small number of cases involving the transfer of clients existing pension policies into Rathbone SIPPs where the case files do not contain conclusive evidence of suitability and a provision has been made in relation to these see note 26.
There remain 30 cases requiring further investigation and, at this stage, it is not practicable to determine what, if any, financial effect there will be for the Group in respect of those remaining cases.
