Notes to the Financial Statements 31 December 2005 1 General information Yule Catto & Co plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given on page 17.
The nature of the groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 4 and in the operating and financial review on pages 6 to 16.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 6, IFRS 7, IFRIC 4, IFRIC 5, IFRIC 6, IFRIC 7 and IFRIC 8.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the group except for additional disclosure on capital and financial instruments when the relevant standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
2 Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union for the first time.
The comparative figures in the primary statements and notes have been restated to reflect the changes to accounting policy resulting from the applications of these standards.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 35.
No reconciliation is provided for the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement as the transition results in presentational changes only to this statement.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the group.
The results of joint ventures are accounted for using equity accounting.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the groups equity therein.
Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination see below and the minoritys share of changes in equity since the date of combination.
Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the interests of the parent except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Financial Statements 37 Notes to the Financial Statements 31 December 2005 continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets Software development and environmental licensing costs resulting in development of a long term intangible asset are measured initially at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the groups product development is recognised only if all of the following conditions in IAS 38 are met: an asset is created that can be separately identified such as software and new processes : it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
No research or development costs met the criteria for required capitalisation under IAS 38 during the year.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Except for freehold land and land grants in Malaysia, which are not depreciated, the cost or valuation of property, plant and equipment is depreciated using a straight line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold land and buildings the lesser of 50 years and the period of the lease Plant and equipment between 3 and 10 years Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Operating leases Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight line basis to the income statement over the term of the relevant lease.
Any benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the groups balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Financial Statements 38 2 Significant accounting policies continued Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the profit and loss account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements.
The group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives, as set out in note 21.
Finance costs Finance costs of debt are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of such instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Finance costs that are directly attributable to the construction of tangible fixed assets are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets in accordance with IAS 23.
Foreign currencies In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the group enters into forward contracts and options see below for details of the groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
The group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as Sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Financial Statements 39 Notes to the Financial Statements 31 December 2005 continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Retirement benefit costs The costs of defined benefit contributions to the groups pension schemes and of augmenting existing pensions are charged to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the expected period of benefits from employees service.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Actuarial gains on the defined benefit schemes are recognised in full in each period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside of profit or loss and are presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the group, in separate trusteeadministered funds.
For the German schemes, the assets are included within the assets of the respective companies, as permitted under local laws.
The assets of the other overseas schemes are held separately from those of the group.
Provisions Provisions for warranty costs are recognised at the date of sale of the relevant products, at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the groups liability.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Share based payments The group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Financial Statements 40 2 Significant accounting policies continued Definitions Group sales Group sales represent the total of revenue from Yule Catto and Co plc, its subsidiaries, and its share of the revenue of joint ventures.
Operating profit Operating profit represents profit before financing costs and taxation.
EBITDA EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and non-recurring items.
Non-recurring items Non-recurring items includes those items that are not directly or indirectly associated with the groups trading performance, which need to be separately disclosed in order to enable improved understanding of the accounts by users.
Non-recurring items are defined as: Profit or loss impact arising from the sale or closure of an operation: Impairment of non-current assets: and Other non-operating or one-off items.
Special items The following are disclosed separately in note 3 as special items in order to provide a clearer indication of the groups underlying performance: Non-recurring items: Mark to market adjustments in respect of cross currency and interest rate derivatives used for hedging purposes where IAS 39 hedge accounting is not applied: Revaluation of US Dollar loan notes from the rate of the related cross currency swaps to the year end rate: and The transitional adjustment required to reflect movements in fair value caused by variations in interest rates, and subsequent amortisation thereof, to the extent that these constituted effective hedges under UK GAAP.
When referring to UK GAAP numbers, special items also includes amortisation of goodwill.
Net borrowings Net borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents together with short and long term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect of related derivative instruments irrespective of whether they qualify for hedge accounting.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the groups accounting policies, which are described above, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts to be recognised in the financial statements apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below.
Impairment of goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was 172.4 million after an impairment loss of 58.9 million was recognised during the transition to IFRS in 2004.
Details of the impairment loss calculation are provided in note 14.
As detailed in note 7, a number of businesses were sold or closed during the year, however these do not satisfy the criteria of IFRS 5 to be treated as discontinued operations.

No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

The key assumptions for the discounted cash flow calculations are those regarding the discount rate, profit and growth rate.
Management estimates pre-tax discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to each CGU.
Discount rates of 8.0-10.0% have been used.
The profit used in the cash flows for the first five years is derived from management forecasts, for years 6 to 10 a growth rate is applied.
The profit for year 10 is then assumed to apply without further growth into perpetuity.
Growth rates of between 2.5 and 5.0% have been used, representing managements best estimate of each CGUs circumstances, and these do not exceed average long term growth rates for the markets concerned.

The special item represents the revaluation of US Dollar loan notes from the rate of the related cross currency swaps to the year end rate, together with the transitional adjustment required to reflect movements in fair value caused by variations in interest rates, and subsequent amortisation thereof, to the extent that these constituted effective hedges under UK GAAP.
21 Financial instruments The groups treasury function operates procedures designed to reduce or eliminate financial risk and ensure that funds are available for current and future needs.
The policies are approved by the Board and the use of financial instruments is strictly controlled.
Yule Catto & Co plcs policy is to finance itself using a mixture of equity and debt instruments.
The groups principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The group also uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk The group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, loan notes and bank borrowings.
The group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile in order to manage the groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Financial Statements 55 Notes to the Financial Statements 31 December 2005 continued 21 Financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk The group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are predominantly denominated in Euros.
Profit translation exposures are not hedged.
The group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The groups policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
Consequently, there are no material currency exposures to disclose 2004 none.
Liquidity risk The objective of the company is to meet financial commitments as and when they fall due.
The Board closely monitors liquidity through monthly management accounts.
At the year end, Yule Catto & Co plc had the following principal facilities: A committed syndicated bank revolving credit facility of 60 million which expires in November 2009.
This credit facility was negotiated in November 2004.
Unsecured loan notes totalling approximately 175 million raised from the US private placement market in 1999 and 2004.
With maturity between 2008 and 2016, these loan notes provide the groups long term requirements.
Please see note 20 for further details.

Impact on income statement Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts amounting to 2,420,691 have been charged to the income statement in the year 2004 260,095.
These changes are shown separately as a special item in the consolidated income statement.
Hedge accounting The group has a number of cross currency and interest rate swaps that are used to reduce the exposure to interest rate and currency risk.
These swaps are fully effective at eliminating the risks they address and as such were accounted for as hedges under UK GAAP.
The group has reviewed the requirements necessary to permit the application of hedge accounting under IAS 39.
It has concluded that the costs involved in meeting these requirements cannot be justified and therefore IAS 39 hedge accounting will not be applied.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments to which hedge accounting is not applied are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
IAS 32 39 exemption IFRS 1 includes an exemption not to restate comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39.
If this exemption were to be taken, the comparative information in the 2005 financial statements would be presented on the existing UK GAAP basis and would not be restated in line with IAS 32 and IAS 39.
To present a consistent treatment in each period, Yule Catto has decided not to take this exemption.
Transitional adjustments The cross currency and interest rate swaps are brought onto the balance sheet as a creditor at fair value as at 1 January 2004.
The carrying value of the US Dollar loan notes is adjusted to reflect movements in currency and interest rates since their inception.
These two adjustments together with an adjustment to the interest accrual produced an overall reduction in net assets of 7.3 million at transition.
Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Financial Statements 56 21 Financial instruments continued Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the groups financial liabilities.
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flow at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The carrying amount of short term borrowings approximates to book value.

Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Financial Statements 64 32 Share based payments Save As You Earn share option plan This plan, which is available to almost all UK employees, provides for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the group shares on the date of grant.
The vesting period is five to seven years, followed by an exercise period of six months after which the options expire.
Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the group before the options vest.

For options expected to be settled with shares purchased by the Yule Catto Employee Benefit Trust in the open market, the charge to profit reflects the anticipated cash cost of these shares spread over the vesting period.
For options expected to be settled by the issue of new shares, no charge to profit is made.
For options outstanding as at 31 December 2005, the exercise price ranged from 1.50 to 2.61, and the weighted average remaining contractual life was 1.3 years 2004 2.3 years.
Executive share options schemes Details of the share option schemes available to senior management are included in the remuneration report on pages 25 to 30.
For grants made after 7 November 2002, the charge to profit is calculated on the assumption that, given that the exercise price is effectively nil, the share price at grant provides a reasonable estimate of the option value at grant.
For grants made before 7 November 2002, the charge to profit is based on the anticipated cash cost of acquiring shares to meet the options exercised.

The impact of these adjustments in financial terms is shown in the subsequent three tables.
A more detailed explanation of these adjustments is given in the restatement document published on 8 September 2005 which is available on the groups website www.
Pensions This represents the impact of bringing the pension liabilities onto the balance sheet entitled post retirement benefit obligations in accordance with IAS 19, together with a related deferred tax asset.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in reserves, and the charge to income under IAS 19 reduces from that charged under UK GAAP.
Goodwill and impairments Under IFRS goodwill is no longer amortised, but subject to an annual impairment review.
Goodwill has been allocated at acquisition date to each acquired cash generating unit.
Where the value of any of these has fallen since acquisition, an impairment has then been charged.
If the carrying value of goodwill was insufficient to absorb the necessary impairment, the property, plant and equipment was impaired.
Net investment hedging Where UK GAAP permitted intra-group lending to to be designated as a hedge against foreign currency assets, IFRS do not.
The UK GAAP treatment resulted in the matching of foreign exchange gains and losses on the retranslation of both the intra-group loans and the foreign currency assets in reserves.
Under IFRS exchange gains and losses on the loans are charged to the income statement, but exchange gains and losses on the assets are taken through reserves.
Financial instruments This represents the impact of separately accounting for the groups borrowings predominantly held in US Dollars and the related derivative contracts which, under the groups commercial hedging arrangements, convert the interest payable against these borrowings into Sterling.
Hedge accounting under IFRS has not been adopted.
Dividends IAS 10 provides that dividends declared after the period end should not be held as a liability at the balance sheet date, hence at 31 December 2004 the final dividend for 2004 must be derecognised and the 2003 final dividend recognised, with the difference being an adjustment to the income statement.
An equivalent adjustment is applied at transition.
Other Smaller adjustments were also made in relation to the recognition of certain intangible assets previously expensed: the disallowance of capitalisation of interest on certain internally financed capital projects: a balance sheet reclassification in relation to share option schemes: and the reversal of revaluations taken under UK GAAP on property.
All properties are now stated at cost.
Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Financial Statements 66 Reconciliation from UK GAAP to IFRS continued Reclassifications Various reclassifications are required to comply with disclosure requirements under IFRS.
The most significant are: the grossing up of cash and short term borrowings where IFRS does not permit the notional pooling arrangements to be recognised, the separate disclosure of deferred and current tax on the face of the balance sheet and a reclassification between deferred and current tax.
Cash flow The groups underlying cash position is unaffected by the transition to IFRS.
However, there are a number of presentational differences arising in the cash flows reported under IAS 7 Cash flow statements.
The cash flows themselves relate to movements in cash and cash equivalents and are classified under three headings operating, investing and financing which results in the reordering of entries from their UK GAAP format.
