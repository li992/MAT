The pub estate valuation was carried out by independent chartered surveyors Christie & Co on an existing use basis and the brewery valuation was carried out by independent chartered surveyors Donaldsons on a depreciated replacement cost basis.
No deferred tax has been recognised on the revaluation adjustment as there are no agreements to sell the assets concerned.
The other fair value adjustments reflect the elimination of goodwill held in the acquired balance sheet, valuation of the Jennings pension scheme and the market value of SWAPs at acquisition date.
Deferred tax has been recognised on the pension scheme and SWAPs fair value adjustments.
