Notes to the Company accounts for the year ended 31 December 2005 33.
Accounting policies The accounts and notes have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and with the Companies Act 1985.
Other than the change in accounting policies noted below, the accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year and the previous year.
The Company adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, FRS 20 Share-based Payment, FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
The effect of adopting FRS 17, FRS 20, FRS 21 and FRS 26 is set out in note 46 below.
The particular policies adopted by the directors are described below.
a Basis of accounting These accounts and notes have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
b Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.
These translation differences are dealt with in the profit for the year.
c Tangible fixed assets and depreciation i Tangible fixed assets are carried at cost.
Depreciation is provided on a straight line or reducing balance basis at rates ranging between: Straight line Freehold land Nil Freehold buildings 2% Leasehold property Over period of lease Computer hardware 33.3% Computer software 33.3% Furniture and office equipment 33.3% Motor vehicles 25% Plant and equipment 10% to 20% ii The costs of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as they accrue.
d Investments Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
e Pensions The Company operates two principal pension schemes for the benefit of permanent members of staff: the Interserve Pension Scheme, which is of the defined benefit type, and the Interserve Retirement Plan, which is of the defined contribution type.
The Company also set up a new defined contribution section of the Interserve Pension Scheme with effect from 1 November 2002.
Actuarial valuations are carried out every three years.
For the purposes of FRS 17, the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the main Group scheme, the Interserve Pension Scheme, on a consistent and reasonable basis.
Therefore, following full implementation of FRS 17, the Company will account for contributions to the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
Note 29 to the consolidated accounts of the Group sets out details of the IAS 19 net pension liability of 132.6 million.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount recognised in the profit and loss account is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes during the year.
Interserve Plc Annual Report 2005 91 Notes to the Company accounts continued for the year ended 31 December 2005 33.
Accounting policies continued f Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the accounts.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries or associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
g Financial instruments Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are measured at fair value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Transactions in derivative financial instruments are for risk management purposes only.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk.
To the extent that such instruments are matched to underlying assets or liabilities, they are accounted for using hedge accounting.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows and net investments are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had been previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, or have not been designated as hedges, are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their economic risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value.

Accounting policies continued g Financial instruments continued Convertible capital bonds Convertible capital bonds are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
The Company has a convertible capital bond that is being carried at historic cost.
It has not been considered possible to value the separate components of the instrument on the basis that this is an equity instrument that does not have a quoted market price in an active market and the derivative which is linked to and must be settled by delivery of such an instrument is not reliably measurable.
h Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2004.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model.
Note 28 to the consolidated accounts of the Group sets out details of the share-based payments.
Profit for the year As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year.

ii As required by the adoption of FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date dividends declared after the balance sheet date but before the accounts are authorised for issue are not recognised as an asset liability at the balance sheet date.

The result is a 4.6 million decrease in reported net assets.
