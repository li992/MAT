The US dollar bond tranches comprise: Fixed Maturity interest date rate m Tranche 1 2006 6.36% 43.9 Tranche 2 2008 6.66% 60.7 Tranche 3 2011 7.10% 31.4 136.0 Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: 2005 2004 m m Within one year 69.5 222.7 After one year but within two years 1.0 71.4 After two years but within three years 60.7 48.4 After three years but within four years 117.6 After four years but within five years 246.6 26.5 After five years 31.4 26.3 409.2 512.9 The loans are drawn for various periods at interest rates linked to LIBOR.
Loans have been drawn under committed facilities and can be refinanced on maturity from these same facilities.
Accordingly they have been aged based on the maturity dates of the underlying facilities.
At 31 December 2005 there were no loans 2004: 0.5m secured by either fixed or floating charges on various assets of the relevant companies.
The Group had available undrawn committed facilities at 31 December as follows: 2005 2004 m m Expiring within one year 29.7 86.9 Expiring after one year but within two years 20.9 Expiring after two years 411.5 398.4 441.2 506.2 Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments as part of its risk management strategies in relation to interest rate and foreign exchange risk as detailed below.
All of these financial instruments are carried at fair value.
Interest rate risk Interest rate swaps with a notional principal of 101.7m were outstanding at 31 December 2005 2004: 91.1m.
The interest rate swaps have swapped $175m of the $225m US dollar bond from fixed to floating rates.
The interest rate is based on US dollar LIBOR repricing every three months.
Financial liabilities with a notional principal of 211.1m were capped at 31 December 2005 2004: 178.2m.
Interest rate caps manage the interest rate risk of floating rate liabilities.
The interest rate is based on US dollar and euro LIBOR and the LIBOR fixings are every three months.
Hedge accounting is not applied to interest rate caps under IAS 39.
