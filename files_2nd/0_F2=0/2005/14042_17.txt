Notes to the financial statements 1.
General information Serco Group plc the Group is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is Serco House, 16 Bartley Wood Business Park, Bartley Way, Hook, Hampshire, RG27 9UY.
These consolidated financial statements the financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting These financial statements on pages 71 to 125 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted for use in the European Union.
First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies adopted under IFRS for the first time with a transition date of 1 January 2004.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS can be found in our announcement of 31 August 2005 Transition to IFRS Report published as part of the interim report 2005.
Reconciliations to IFRS from the previously published UK GAAP financial statements are shown in note 39.
General The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The Group adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement prospectively from 1 January 2005.
Accordingly, comparative information has not been restated.
Details of the adoption are set out in note 39.
Presentation of financial information The primary statements within the financial information contained in this document have been presented in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries and entities jointly controlled by the Company its joint ventures made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries and joint ventures to bring accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented separately from parent shareholders equity within equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
com 75 Notes to the financial statements 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, or jointly-controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary or jointly-controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been carried forward as the unadjusted UK GAAP amounts.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated.
Investments in joint ventures The Groups investments in joint ventures are reported in the financial statements using the proportionate consolidation method, whereby the Groups share of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of its joint ventures is combined line by line with similar items in the Groups financial statements or reported as separate line items within the Groups financial statements.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Revenue from long-term project-based contracts is recognised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy below.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Significant accounting policies continued Segmental information Segmental information is based on two segment formats: the primary format reflects the Groups management structure, whereas the secondary format is .
Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate expenses.
Specific corporate expenses are allocated to the corresponding segments.
Segment assets comprise goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, other debtors and prepayments, inventories and trade and other receivables excluding corporation tax recoverable.
Liabilities comprise trade and other payables and retirement benefit obligations.
Inter-segment trading is not significant.
Long-term project-based contracts The Group has a number of long-term contracts for the provision of complex, project-based services.
Where the outcome of such long-term project-based contracts can be measured reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
This is measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a long-term project-based contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs that it is probable will be recovered.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
All bid costs are expensed through the income statement up to the point where contract award or full recovery of costs is virtually certain.
Bid costs incurred after this point are then capitalised within trade and other receivables.
On contract award these bid costs are amortised through the income statement over the contract period by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and comprise service spares and long-term project-based contract balances.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at fair value or, if lower, at the present value of minimum lease payments determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are directly attributable to a qualifying asset, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs see below.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
com 77 Notes to the financial statements 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity in the statement of recognised income and expense SORIE.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised directly within equity in the Groups hedging and translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an income or expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and are presented in the SORIE.
The current service cost represents the increase in the present value of the plan liabilities expected to arise from employee service in the current period.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefit becomes vested.
Gains and losses on curtailments or settlements are recognised in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service costs, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Defined benefit obligations arising from contractual obligations Where the Group takes on a contract and assumes the obligation to contribute variable amounts to the defined benefit pension scheme throughout the period of the contract and it is not virtually certain that the contributions will be recovered from the customer, the Groups share of the defined benefit obligation less its share of the pension scheme assets that it will fund over the period of the contract is recognised as a liability at the start of the contract with a corresponding amount being recognised as an intangible asset.
The intangible asset, which reflects the Groups right to manage and operate the contract, is amortised over the contract period.
The Groups share of the scheme assets and liabilities is calculated by reducing the scheme assets and liabilities by a franchise adjustment.
The franchise adjustment represents the amount of scheme deficits that will be funded outside the contract period.
Subsequent actuarial gains and losses in relation to the Groups share of pension obligations are recognised outside the income statement and are presented in the SORIE.
Significant accounting policies continued Defined benefit obligations arising from contractual obligations continued Where the Group takes on a contract and assumes the obligation to contribute variable amounts to the defined benefit pension scheme throughout the period of the contract and it is virtually certain that the contributions will be recovered from the customer, the Groups share of the defined benefit obligation less its share of the pension scheme assets are recognised as a liability at the start of the contract with a corresponding amount being recognised as a financial asset at fair value, being the fair value of the reimbursable rights.
In the consolidated income statement, the expense relating to the defined benefit plan is presented net of the amount recognised for reimbursement.
The change in fair value of the reimbursable right that is not presented in the income statement is reported in the SORIE.
Multi-employer pension schemes Multi-employer pension schemes are classified as a defined contribution pension scheme or a defined benefit scheme under the terms of the scheme.
When sufficient information is not available to use defined benefit accounting for a multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme, the Group accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
Tax The tax expense represents the sum of current tax expense and deferred tax expense.
Current tax expense is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for accounting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which these items can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of an asset and liability in a transaction other than a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based upon tax rates and legislation that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legal enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority where the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
com 79 Notes to the financial statements 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Assets held for use in the rendering of services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the balance sheet at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates to reduce the assets to their residual value over their estimated useful lives.
The principal annual rates used are: Freehold buildings 2.5% Short-leasehold building improvements the higher of 10% or the rate produced by lease term Machinery 15% 20% Motor vehicles 18% 50% Furniture 10% Office equipment 20% 33% Leased equipment the higher of the rate produced by lease term or useful life The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Research and development costs Expenditure on research is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred unless the criteria for capitalisation are met see Other intangible assets policy below.
Other intangible assets Customer relationships represent the value of contracts acquired on the acquisition of subsidiaries and are amortised over the average length of contracts of five years.
Development expenditure relating to software is capitalised as an intangible asset only if all of the following conditions are met: an asset is created that can be identified: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Development expenditure is amortised over the period in which the Group is expected to benefit.
This period is between three to five years, or the length of the contract if longer.
Provision is also made for any impairment.
All other development expenditure is written off as incurred.
Assets under the course of construction are not depreciated.
Licences comprise premiums paid for the acquisition of licences, which are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the licence.
Franchises represent costs incurred in obtaining franchise rights and franchise goodwill arising on the acquisition of franchises.
These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the franchise.
Pension related intangibles represent assets arising in relation to the Groups right to manage and operate contracts where there is a defined benefit pension scheme and it is not virtually certain that contributions will be recovered from the customer but where the Groups obligation to contribute to the scheme ends when the contract ends.
The intangible assets represent the Groups share of scheme net liabilities on the date that contracts commence and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the contract life.
Significant accounting policies continued Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill Annually, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Impairment losses and reversals are included within other expenses within the consolidated income statement.
Share-based payment The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were not fully vested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and operates an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn share option scheme open to eligible employees which allows the purchase of shares at a discount.
These are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes, Binomial or Monte Carlo Simulation models depending on the type of scheme, as set out in note 35.
The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Where relevant, the value of the option has also been adjusted to take account of market conditions applicable to the option.
Accounting for PFI contracts Within Public Private Partnership PPP projects including Private Finance Initiative PFI projects, where the concession agreement transfers limited risks and rewards associated with ownership to the contractors, during the period of initial asset construction, costs incurred as a direct consequence of financing, designing and constructing the asset are shown as PFI assets in the course of construction within non-current trade and other receivables.
On completion of the asset construction phase the asset is transferred within trade and other receivables to a PFI debtor.
Revenues received from the customer are apportioned between capital repayments and operating revenue.
The finance income element of the capital repayment is shown as notional interest receivable within investment revenue.
The Group has seven fully owned Special Purpose Companies SPC which are used for the purpose of running the PFI business.
All other SPCs are joint ventures and accounted for using the proportionate consolidation method.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant changes in value and have a maturity of three months or less.
This definition is also used for the consolidated cash flow statement.
com 81 Notes to the financial statements 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Dividends Dividends are recorded in the Groups consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Groups shareholders.
Loans Loans are initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the period.
Loans of certain SPCs and joint ventures are described as non recourse loans and classified as such only if no Group company other than the relevant borrower has an obligation, under a guarantee or other arrangement, to repay the debt.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group has adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement with effect from 1 January 2005.
Derivatives are initially accounted for and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to the income statement except where the derivative is a designated cash flow hedging instrument.
The accounting treatment of derivatives classified as hedges depends on their designation, which occurs on the date that the derivative contract is committed to.
The Group designates derivatives as: a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability fair value hedge a hedge of the income cost of a highly probable forecast transaction or commitment cash flow hedge a hedge of net investment in a foreign entity.
Gains and losses on fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement with the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Gains or losses on cash flow hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity.
Where the forecast transaction results in a financial asset or liability, only gains or losses previously recognised in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the same period as the asset or liability affects profit or loss.
Where the forecast transaction or commitment results in a non-financial asset or liability, any gains or losses previously deferred in equity are included in the cost of the related asset or liability if the forecast transaction or commitment results in future income or expenditure.
Gains and losses deferred in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period as the underlying income or expenditure.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
For the ineffective portion of hedges or transactions that are not designated for hedge accounting under IAS 39, any change in assets or liabilities is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where a hedge no longer meets the effectiveness criteria, any gains or losses deferred in equity are only transferred to the income statement when the committed or forecast transaction is recognised in the income statement.
However, where cash flow hedge accounting has been applied for a forecast or committed transaction that is no longer expected to occur, then the cumulative gain or loss that has been recorded in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign entities through currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the translation of the borrowings are recognised in equity.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Significant accounting policies continued New standards and interpretations not applied During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRSs Effective date IFRS 1 Amendment relating to IFRS 6 1 January 2006 IFRS 6 Amendment relating to IFRS 6 1 January 2006 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2006 IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures 1 January 2006 IAS 19 Amendment Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Fair Value Option 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Amendments to IAS 39 Transition and Initial Recognition of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Day 1 profits 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Cash Flow Hedge Accounting 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Financial Guarantee Contracts 1 January 2006 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease 1 January 2006 The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Upon adoption of IFRS 7, the Group will have to disclose additional information about its financial instruments, their significance and the nature and extent of risks that they give rise to.
More specifically the Group will need to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure in greater detail.
There will be no effect on reported income or net assets.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 2 above, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised for certain long-term project-based contracts based on the stage of completion of the contract activity.
This is measured by the proportion of costs incurred to estimated contract costs except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of CGUs and also the selection of appropriate discount rates, which involves judgement, to calculate present values see note 13.
The carrying value of goodwill is 544.5m 2004: 177.4m at the balance sheet date.
Retirement benefit obligations The calculation of retirement benefit obligations is dependent on material key assumptions including discount rates, future returns on assets and future contribution rates see note 28.
The value of retirement benefit obligations at the balance sheet date is 306.6m 2004: 242.9m.
Details of the impact of changes in assumptions relating to retirement benefit obligations are disclosed in the Finance Review page 39. www.

Earnings per share Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share have been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings Per Share.
Earnings per share EPS is shown both before and after amortisation of intangible assets to assist in the understanding of the impact of IAS 38 Intangible Assets on the Group financial statements.
The calculation of the basic and diluted EPS is based on the following data: Number of shares 2005 2004 millions millions Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic EPS 458.1 430.1 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share options 8.0 5.3 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted EPS 466.1 435.4 Earnings 2005 2004 Earnings Per share Earnings Per share amount amount m Pence m Pence Earnings for the purpose of basic EPS being net profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent 53.4 11.66 43.5 10.11 Add back: Amortisation of intangible assets, net of tax 11.2 2.43 5.8 1.35 Basic earnings before amortisation of intangible assets 64.6 14.09 49.3 11.46 Earnings for the purpose of basic EPS 53.4 11.66 43.5 10.11 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares 0.20 0.12 Diluted EPS 53.4 11.46 43.5 9.99 At 31 December 2005 options over 9.4 million 2004: 13.8 million shares were excluded from the weighted average number of shares used for calculating diluted earnings per share because their share price was below the average share price for the year and they were, therefore, anti-dilutive.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations using cash flow projections based on financial plans approved by senior management covering a five year period.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to revenue and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in revenue and direct costs are based on past practices, the Groups order book and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on an estimated growth rate of 2.25%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the UK.

Financial risk management Financial risk The Groups treasury function is responsible for managing the Groups exposure to financial risk and operates within a defined set of policies and procedures reviewed and approved by the Board.
Credit facilities and liquidity management The Group maintains committed credit facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and planned expansions.
The Groups main committed credit facility the Bank Facility, expires in December 2009, and comprises term loans of 146m and USD229m, and an undrawn 155m revolving credit facility.
The Bank Facility is unsecured, with covenants and obligations typical of these types of arrangement.
The Group continues to service two private placements.
The first, for 43.2m, was taken out in 1997 and matures in 2007.
The second, for 117.0m, was taken out in 2003 and amortises from 2011 to 2015.
Foreign exchange risk The nature of the Groups business in general does not involve a significant amount of cross-border trade.
Consequently, the Group is not exposed to substantial foreign currency transaction risk as sales and costs are approximately matched within overseas operations.
Material transactional exposures of individual business units are hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts.
The foreign exchange exposure on the US Dollar tranches of the private placements has been fully hedged into Sterling.
Central funding of individual business units gives rise to monetary assets and liabilities centrally and in the business units.
The currency of resultant debt is selected to ensure that any foreign exchange risk is borne and managed by the Groups treasury function using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its interest-bearing assets and liabilities is selectively managed, using interest rate swaps.
Lenders of non recourse debt generally require that the debt is maintained on fixed rate terms or is swapped to fixed rate terms.
Therefore the Group hedges its interest rate risk by using interest rate swaps to exchange floating interest cash flows to fixed interest cash flows.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is relatively low because a high proportion of trade and other receivables have a sovereign or close to sovereign credit rating and the Group has a large number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
100 Annual review and accounts 2005 26 a Currency management The Groups net foreign exchange transaction exposure is 5.8m 2004: 8.0m.

The interest rate on floating rate financial liabilities is linked to three-month or six-month LIBOR.
26 c Hedge of net investment in foreign entity The Group has US Dollar denominated borrowings, which it has designated as a hedge of part of the net investment in its subsidiaries in the USA.
The fair value of the designated borrowings was 28.5m 2004: nil.
The foreign exchange loss of 2.5m 2004: nil on translation of the borrowings into Sterling has been recognised within the Groups hedging and translation reserve.

The fair value of the Groups derivative financial instruments are based on quoted market prices for equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
As set out in note 2, as permitted by IFRS 1, the Group opted to delay the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 until 1 January 2005.
27 a Currency risk management The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows.
The Group is party to a variety of foreign currency forward contracts and swaps in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
At the balance sheet date, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the Group is committed is 72.6m 2004: 31.1m.
These arrangements are mainly designed to address significant exchange exposures for the next eighteen months.
102 Annual review and accounts 2005 27 a Currency risk management continued Cash flow hedges At 31 December 2005 the Group held a number of currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges.
Fixed interest cash flows denominated in US Dollars are exchanged for fixed interest cash flows denominated in Sterling.
The profile of these currency swaps held by the Group was as follows: At 31 December 2005 and at 1 January 2005 Notional Payable USD Receivable GBP amount interest rate interest rate Maturity USDm % % December 2007 39.0 7.6 6.8 August 2015 35.0 5.7 5.7 August 2015 20.0 5.7 5.7 The Group also held a number of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of 24.7m 2004: 0.5m.
All currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are highly effective and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity.
Fair value hedges At 31 December 2005, the Group had currency swaps in place with a notional amount of USD31m whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 6.81% and pays a floating rate based on LIBOR on the notional amount.
The swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of the Groups US Dollar denominated private placement loans.
In addition, the Group held a forward foreign exchange contract with a notional amount of USD15m designated as a fair value hedge, hedging the foreign exchange exposure on the final repayment of the Groups US Dollar denominated private placement loans.
27 b Interest rate risk management Cash flow hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk on its non recourse loans by swapping these loans from floating to fixed rates.
These swaps cover seven, non recourse loans.
The profile of these interest rate swaps is as follows: At 31 December 2005 Notional Payable GBP Receivable GBP amount interest rate interest rate Maturity m % % June 2010 5.3 6.2 LIBOR February 2011 45.8 5.5 LIBOR June 2014 19.2 8.7 LIBOR June 2015 23.4 7.3 LIBOR December 2015 22.3 6.7 LIBOR December 2017 59.8 6.8 LIBOR February 2023 86.0 5.6 LIBOR 261.8 www.

An amount of 4.0m 2004: 3.5m has been offset against hedged interest payments made in the period.
Retirement benefit schemes The Group has accounted for pensions in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The Group operates and is a member of a number of defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes.
The pension charge for the year ended 31 December 2005, including the proportionate share of joint ventures, was 55.6m 2004: 39.5m.
28 a Defined benefit schemes The Group operates defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the UK, Europe and the Middle East.
In addition the Group has interests in joint ventures, which operate defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees.
The assets of the funded plans are held independently of the Groups assets in separate trustee administered funds.
The Groups major plans are valued by independent actuaries annually using the projected unit credit method.
This reflects service rendered by employees to the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of benefits, projected rates of salary growth, and long-term expected rates of return for plan assets.
Discount rates are based on the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds in the country concerned.
Long-term expected rates of return for plan assets are based on published brokers forecasts for each category of scheme assets.
Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit schemes are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan and intends to exercise this right.
The amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet are grouped together as follows: Contract specific Virtually certain costs reimbursed The Group has an obligation to contribute to the pension scheme over the term of the contract.
At rebid any deficit or surplus would transfer to the next contractor.
Throughout the contract, it is virtually certain that the Group will be reimbursed the expenditure required to settle the defined benefit obligation.
The Groups share of the defined benefit obligation less its share of the fair value of scheme assets that it will fund over the period of the contract has been recognised as a liability.
The Group has recognised the right to reimbursement as a separate asset.
In the consolidated income statement, the expense relating to this defined benefit plan has been presented net of the amount recognised for the reimbursement, resulting in a nil charge to the income statement.
Contract specific Not certain costs will be reimbursed These are pre-funded defined benefit schemes.
The Group has obligations to contribute variable amounts to the pension schemes over the terms of the related contracts.
The Group has recognised as a liability the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of scheme assets that it will fund over the period of the contracts with a corresponding amount recognised as intangible assets at the start of the contracts.
Subsequent actuarial gains and losses in relation to the Groups share of the pension obligations have been recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense the SORIE.
The intangible assets are amortised over the term of the contracts.
104 Annual review and accounts 2005 28 a Defined benefit schemes continued Non contract specific These consist of a pre-funded defined benefit scheme which does not relate to any specific contract the funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as will achieve 100% funding on a projected salary basis : an unfunded defined benefit scheme and an unfunded hybrid scheme all of which do not relate to any specific contract.
Any liabilities arising are recognised in full.

In some schemes, employee contributions vary over time to meet a specified proportion of the overall costs, including a proportion of any deficit.
The liabilities recognised in the balance sheet for these schemes are net of the proportion attributed to employees.
In addition, the amounts charged to the consolidated income statement for these schemes are net of the proportion attributed to employees.
The amounts attributed to employees are shown separately in the reconciliation of changes in the fair value of scheme assets and liabilities.

The options are granted at market value and awards made to eligible employees are based on between 50% and 100% of salary as at 31 December prior to grant.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options may be forfeited if the eligible employee leaves the group before the options vest.

Share-based payment continued The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 2.470 2004: 1.525.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2005 had a weighted average exercise price of 1.674 2004: 1.611 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.62 years 2004: 1.46 years.
The fair value of options granted under the EOP is measured by use of the Binomial lattice model.
The Binomial model is considered to be most appropriate for valuing options granted under this scheme as it allows exercise over a longer period of time between the vesting date and the expiry date.
The inputs into the Binomial model are: 2005 2004 Weighted average share price 260p 240p Weighted average exercise price 167.4p 161.1p Expected volatility 45.5% to 46.6% 45.5% to 46.6% Expected life 5 years 5 years Risk free rate 4.0% to 4.9% 4.0% to 4.9% Expected dividends 1.1% to 1.5% 1.1% to 1.5% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous 5 years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Long-Term Incentive Scheme the LTIS Awards made to eligible employees under the LTIS, which are structured as options with a zero exercise price, may be exercised after the third anniversary of grant.
The extent to which an award vests and therefore becomes exercisable is measured by reference to the growth in the Companys earnings per share over the performance period of three financial years.
Weighted average Number exercise of options price 000 Outstanding at 1 January 2005 1,978 Nil Granted during the year 314 Nil Outstanding at 31 December 2005 2,292 Nil None of these options were exercisable at the end of the year.
The fair value of options granted under the LTIS is measured by use of a Monte Carlo Simulation model.
This model is considered to be most appropriate for valuing options granted under the LTIS as it takes into account the changes in performance conditions by which the options are measured.
Share-based payment continued The inputs into the Monte Carlo Simulation model are: 2005 2004 Weighted average share price 260p 240p Weighted average exercise price Nil Nil Expected volatility 41.8% to 51.0% 41.8% to 51.0% Expected life 3 years 3 years Risk free rate 3.8% to 4.8% 3.8% to 4.8% Expected dividends 1.0% to 1.5% 1.0% to 1.5% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous 3 years.
Sharesave 2004 The Sharesave 2004 scheme provides for a purchase price equal to the daily average market price on the date of grant less 20%.
The shares can be purchased during a two-week period each year.

Transition to IFRS For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2004, the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
These financial statements are the first the Group is required to prepare in accordance with IFRS.
IFRS 1 establishes the transitional requirements for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS for the first time.
The general principle is that the IFRS effective at the first-time adoption reporting date 31 December 2005 for the Group are to be applied retrospectively to the opening IFRS balance sheet 1 January 2004 the comparative period 2004 and the reporting period 2005.
Outlined below is the Groups position in relation to key exemptions and exceptions that are available under IFRS.
Business combinations The Group has adopted the exemption not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations in respect of acquisitions occurring prior to 1 January 2004.
As a result, in the opening balance sheet, goodwill arising from past business combinations excluding amounts reclassified as intangible assets remains as stated under UK GAAP at 1 January 2004.
Employee benefits The Group has recognised actuarial gains and losses in relation to employee benefit schemes at 1 January 2004.
The Group has recognised actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they occur in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense in accordance with the amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits, issued on 16 December 2004.
Share-based payment IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
Under UK GAAP the Groups shares held in the Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP trust were amortised within the ESOP reserve, and charged to the profit and loss account.
Under IFRS 2, the fair value of all share and share option awards is calculated and then amortised in the income statement over the vesting period.
The carrying amount of the ESOP reserve on transition to IFRS has been maintained at the carrying amount under UK GAAP at that date.
On transition to IFRS, the cumulative IFRS 2 charge has been shown within a separate share-based payment reserve within Equity.
Cumulative translation differences The Group has adopted the exemption to set cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to zero at 1 January 2004.
The gain or loss on a subsequent disposal of any foreign operation will exclude translation differences that arose before 1 January 2004, but will include later translation differences.
Financial instruments The Group has adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement effective from 1 January 2005 and therefore there is no impact on the Groups balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 or 31 December 2004 on transition to IFRS.
Adjustments arising from adopting IAS 39 impact the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2005 as certain financial instruments, notably interest rate swaps, are recognised at fair value.
The effect of these adjustments is shown in note 27.
Movements in the fair value of these financial instruments are recognised within a separate Hedging and Translation reserve within Equity.
Accounting for PFI contracts In March 2005, the IFRIC issued a draft interpretation on accounting for service concession arrangements, including PPP projects and PFI projects, which has since been withdrawn.
The Group has, from 1 January 2005, recognised the PFI debtors relating to concession arrangements held by PFI companies at amortised cost as defined by IAS 39.
The effect of adopting this policy is to maintain an accounting treatment consistent with UK GAAP while ensuring that the accounting treatment remains consistent with existing IFRS.
com 119 Notes to the financial statements 39.
Transition to IFRS continued The draft guidance from IFRIC, if it were re-issued in final form, would potentially require a number of changes to the accounting treatment of service concession arrangements.
One of the more significant aspects would be the requirement to recognise the assets associated with concession arrangements at fair value.
This requirement could potentially produce a significant increase in the carrying value of the Groups PFI debtors held within PFI companies.
Key IFRS adjustments and their impact on the financial statements Key IFRS adjustments are outlined below, with summary financial details for the specific accounting periods being provided.
IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures IAS 31 requires that interests in joint ventures are recognised using proportionate consolidation or the alternative equity method of accounting.
This is a change from the gross equity method required under UK GAAP.
The Group has elected to recognise its interests in joint ventures using the proportionate consolidation method whereby the Groups share of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of its joint ventures is combined line by line with similar items in the Groups financial statements or reported as separate line items within the Groups financial statements.
Consequently, the presentation of information on joint ventures is now comprehensive.
There is no impact on profit for the year as a result of the change.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations IFRS 3 prohibits the amortisation of goodwill.
The goodwill amortisation charge under UK GAAP of 15.9m for the year ended 31 December 2004 has been reversed in the IFRS restated results.
IAS 38 Intangible Assets Franchise assets which are identifiable non-monetary assets have been reclassified as intangible assets in accordance with IFRS requirements.
The effect of this is to reclassify assets from goodwill to other intangible assets of 47.7m as at 1 January 2004 and 59.0m as at 31 December 2004.
Net assets are not affected by this adjustment.
The amortisation charge relating to these franchise assets was 5.4m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
In addition where the Group has recognised its share of a defined benefit pension obligation that it will fund over the period of a contract or franchise, the liability recognised on transition to IFRS or at the beginning of the contract or franchise is treated as an intangible asset representing the rights to the future economic benefits of the contract or franchise.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits: Pension scheme adjustments In accordance with IAS 19, the Group has recognised retirement benefit obligations in relation to defined benefit schemes.
Where the Group takes on a contract and assumes the obligation to contribute variable amounts to the defined benefit scheme throughout the contract, and it is not virtually certain that these contributions will be recovered from the customer, the Group has recognised its proportionate share of the pension scheme obligations together with a corresponding amount as an intangible asset, representing the right to the future economic benefits of operating the contract or franchise over its life.
Where it is virtually certain that pension contributions will be recovered, the Group has recognised a financial asset in trade and other receivables.
The Group has potential deferred tax assets in respect of the deficits on defined benefit pension schemes.
Under IAS 12, these are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Transition to IFRS continued These changes have resulted in the following adjustments to the balance sheet: As at As at 1 January 31 December 2004 2004 m m Other intangible assets 4.1 15.5 Deferred tax asset 42.0 50.8 Trade and other receivables 12.1 20.0 Deferred tax liabilities 4.0 Retirement benefit obligation 169.9 204.5 Change in net assets 111.7 122.2 Under UK GAAP, the pension charge was included in cost of sales and administrative expenses.
The IAS 19 pension charge includes a service cost which is included in cost of sales and administrative expenses, and interest on pension obligations net of the return on pension fund assets which is included in finance costs.
The amortisation of intangible assets is included within other operating expenses.
The net effect is to increase profit before tax by 0.4m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits: Employee benefit accruals and provisions IAS 19 requires that when employees provide a service to a company, the estimated amount that will be paid in exchange for those services should be recognised.
On transition to IFRS, the Group has recognised employee benefit accruals and provisions in respect of holiday pay, long-term disability benefits and long-term service award benefits.
The adjustment on transition reflects a cumulative adjustment for the services provided by employees up to the date of transition.
Following transition, the movement on these accruals and provisions reflects the current period service cost.
Arising from the recognition of these accruals and provisions, net of deferred tax, net assets have reduced by 16.0m as at 1 January 2004 and 17.5m as at 31 December 2004.
IAS 10 Events After the Balance Sheet Date Under IAS 10, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
Dividends are recorded in the Groups consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Groups shareholders.
The dividends proposed but not approved at the balance sheet date have been reversed from the financial statements.
This has the effect of increasing the net assets of the Group by the amount of the proposed dividend of 7.0m as at 1 January 2004 and 8.3m as at 31 December 2004.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment IFRS 2 Share-based Payment requires the recognition of an expense in relation to all share-based payment such as the Groups share and share option schemes.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and operates an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn share option scheme open to eligible employees which allows the purchase of shares at a discount to the market value.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes, Binomial or Monte Carlo Simulation models depending on the type of scheme.
Under UK GAAP, the Groups shares held in the ESOP trust were amortised within the ESOP reserve and charged to the profit and loss account.
This charge has been reversed and replaced with the IFRS 2 charge.
The IFRS 2 charge for 2004 was 4.6m and after reversing the amortisation of shares held in the ESOP reserve of 1.2m, the net effect is to reduce profit before tax by 3.4m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
A related deferred tax asset of 0.5m as at 1 January 2004 and 1.4m as at 31 December 2004 has been recognised and will be realised as and when share options vest and are exercised.
com 121 Notes to the financial statements 39.
Transition to IFRS continued IAS 12 Income Taxes The income tax adjustments required under IAS 12 fall into two categories: Firstly, deferred tax that needs to be provided in respect of other IFRS restatement accounting adjustments for example, pension scheme adjustments, employee benefits accruals, goodwill.
Secondly, specific deferred tax adjustments that arise on the different recognition criteria of deferred tax balances between UK GAAP FRS 19 and IFRS IAS 12 for example, share-based payment, PFI contracts and unremitted earnings from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and investments.
The most significant tax adjustments for the Group relate to the deferred tax treatment of pensions and PFI contracts.
The Group has accounted for deferred tax assets in respect of the pension related assets and deficits refer to the above note regarding pension scheme adjustments under IAS 19.
The principles for the calculation of and recognition of deferred tax for PFI contract companies under IAS 12 are different to those applied under FRS 19.
Specifically, IAS 12 requires that whenever a PFI debtor is acquired as a business combination, deferred tax needs to be provided upon recognition of that debtor for all future tax that will become payable as the debtor is recovered.
For the Group, this has resulted in additional deferred tax liabilities being recognised at the date of transition.
In addition, IAS 12 further requires that whenever a PFI debtor is recognised but not by way of a business combination, deferred tax is only recognised as the debtor is recovered no additional deferred tax is recognised on transition and this therefore leads to smaller deferred tax liabilities in early periods of the contract with an increasing effective tax rate over the project life.
As a result of the change in accounting for deferred tax on PFI debtors, the tax charge has reduced by 2.5m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The additional deferred tax in the balance sheet has led to a reduction in net assets of 17.6m as at 1 January 2004 and 18.7m as at 31 December 2004.
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement The Group adopted IAS 39 on 1 January 2005: the standard therefore had no effect on the Groups financial statements prior to that date.
Adoption of IAS 39 resulted in a 27.1m reduction in opening net assets 37.9m net of a tax credit of 10.8m on 1 January 2005.
This represents the net effect of marking to market the interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and other derivatives held by the Group.
The effect on opening net assets has been reflected in reserves.
These derivatives are mainly held to convert the floating rate interest obligations of PFI Special Purpose Companies into fixed rate obligations, and to hedge the Groups obligations under its long term loan notes.

Accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted are shown below.
Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and applicable UK law.
Accounting convention These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Prior year comparatives The Company has restated the prior year comparatives in accordance with the revisions to UK GAAP under FRS 20 Share-based payment and FRS 21 Post balance sheet events.
Fixed asset investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates which, in the opinion of the Directors, reduce the assets to their residual value over their estimated useful lives.
The principal annual rates used are: Short leasehold building improvements the higher of 10% or rate produced by lease term Machinery 15% 20% Furniture 10% Office equipment 20% 33% Share-based payment The Group has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were not fully vested as of 1 January 2005.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Company has adopted FRS 26 Financial instruments: Measurement with effect from 1 January 2005.
The gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to the profit and loss account except where the derivative is a designated cash flow hedging instrument.
The Company designates derivatives as: a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability fair value hedge a hedge of the income cost of a highly probable forecast transaction or commitment cash flow hedge a hedge of net investment in a foreign entity Gains and losses on fair value are recorded in the profit and loss account with the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
com 129 Notes to the company financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued Gains or losses on cash flow hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity.
Where the forecast transaction results in a financial asset or liability only gains or losses previously recognised in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the same period as the asset or liability affects profit or loss.
Gains and losses deferred in equity are transferred to the profit and loss account in the same period as the underlying income or expenditure.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the profit and loss account.
For the ineffective portion of hedges or transactions that are not designated for hedge accounting under FRS 26, any change in assets or liabilities is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Where a hedge no longer meets the effectiveness criteria, any gains or losses deferred in equity are only transferred to the profit and loss account when the committed or forecast transaction is recognised in the profit and loss account.
However, where cash flow hedge accounting has been applied for a forecast or committed transaction that is no longer expected to occur, then the cumulative gain or loss that has been recorded in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the profit and loss account.
Where the Company hedges net investments in foreign entities through currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the translation of the borrowings are recognised in equity.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the profit and loss account when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Current tax Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax The charge for tax takes account of taxation deferred because of differences between the timing of recognition of certain items for taxation purposes and for accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where the transactions or events that give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future have occurred by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only when it is considered more likely than not that it will be recovered.
Deferred tax is recognised on a non-discounted basis using tax rates in force at the balance sheet date.
Auditors remuneration Auditors remuneration and other charges from Deloitte & Touche LLP are borne by another group company.
