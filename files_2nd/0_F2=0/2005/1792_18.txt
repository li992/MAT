At 31 December 2005, the xed interest rates range from 4.565% to 5.055% and principal oating rates are LIBOR.
Other than in respect of PFI PPP concessions, all interest-rate swaps were terminated during 2005.
Forward foreign exchange contracts: The notional principal amounts of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations at 31 December 2005 was 151m 2004: 105m.
The gains and losses in equity on hedges of net investments in foreign operations will be released to the income statement on the disposal of the underlying net investment.
The credit risk on derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit agencies.
Since the Group has only applied IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005, the comparatives above are nil.
In 2004 a net investment in foreign operations hedges of 1m was included within trade and other receivables in the Group balance sheet and 1m was included within both trade and other receivables and trade and other payables in the Company balance sheet.

Based on prior experience and an assessment of the current economic environment, management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for impairment of trade receivables.
The Directors consider that the carrying values of current trade and other receivables approximate their fair values.
The fair value of non-current trade and other receivables amounts to 32m 2004: 37m and has been determined using yield curves and exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date and discounting future cash ows at interest rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
It is Group policy that forward foreign exchange contracts are taken out as soon as a foreign currency receivable is identied.

The borrowings are secured by xed and oating charges over each concession companys right, title and interest in certain assets and or revenues and over each concession companys shares held by their immediate parent companies, Connect Roads Sunderland Holdings Ltd and Connect Roads South Tyneside Holdings Ltd. At 31 December 2004, the PFI PPP project finance sterling debt obligations included those arising under non-recourse facilities in the 2 concession companies, Connect A30 A35 Ltd, Connect A50 Ltd and Connect M77 GSO plc, which became joint ventures following the sale of a 15% interest to I in December 2005.
A significant part of the PFI PPP non-recourse project finance oating rate term loans have been swapped into xed rate debt by the use of interest rate swaps.
The interest rate obligations under the US dollar xed rate term loan were swapped into oating rate sterling obligations.
The loan and associated interest rate swaps were repaid in 2005 resulting in a net exceptional loss of 6m see Note 8.

No deferred tax has been recognised owing to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Of this total, 160m 2004: 120m will expire 20 years after the year in which they arose, using losses incurred in earlier years before those incurred in later years, with the first expiry in 2015.
The remaining losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed reserves of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 130m 2004: 150m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Contributions are determined in accordance with independent actuarial advice.
Details of the IAS 19 valuations are set out in 25.1 below.
Details of the last actuarial valuations and reviews and the assumptions used by the actuaries are set out in 25.2 below.
25.1 IAS 19 valuations The latest actuarial funding valuations of the Groups principal dened benefit schemes have been updated by the actuaries to 31 December 2005 on the basis prescribed by IAS 19.
In particular, scheme liabilities have been discounted using the rate of return on a high quality corporate bond rather than the expected rate of return on the assets in the scheme used in the funding valuations.
Other than the mortality assumptions set out in 25.2, the principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: 2005 2004 Balfour Balfour Beatty Railways Beatty Railways Pension Pension Mansell Pension Pension Mansell Fund Scheme schemes Fund Scheme schemes %%% %%% Ination rate 2.80 2.80 2.80 2.80 2.80 2.80 Discount rate 4.75 4.75 4.75 5.30 5.30 5.30 Future salary increases 4.30 4.30 4.30 4.30 4.30 4.30 Future pension increases 2.80 2.80 2.80 2.80 2.80 2.80 Expected return on plan assets 5.98 7.00 6.60 6.11 7.11 7.06 The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: 2005 2004 Balfour Balfour Beatty Railways Beatty Railways Pension Pension Mansell Other Pension Pension Mansell Other Fund Scheme schemes schemes Total Fund Scheme schemes schemes Total m m m m m m m m m m Present value of funded obligations 1,820 159 212 14 2,205 1,638 125 190 12 1,965 Fair value of plan assets 1,643 136 160 12 1,951 1,479 111 133 12 1,735 deficit 177 23 52 2 254 159 14 57 230 Present value of unfunded obligations 26 26 24 24 Liability in the balance sheet 177 23 52 28 280 159 14 57 24 254 Other schemes comprise funded and unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations in Europe and North America, the majority of which arrangements are closed to new entrants.

The rates of return for each class were determined as follows: equities and property: the rate adopted is consistent with the median assumption used in the actuarys asset modelling work as at 31 December: bonds: the overall rate has been set to reect the yields available on the gilts and corporate bond holdings held at 31 December: cash and other net current assets: this class is mostly made of up of cash holdings and the rate adopted reects current short-term returns on such deposits.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the funded schemes during 2006 is 42m.
Contributions paid in 2005 for the principal schemes were 29m 2004: 30m for the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund, 1m 2004: 2m for the Railways Pension Scheme and 7m 2004: 8m for the Mansell schemes.
The Railways Pension Scheme is a shared cost scheme.
Accordingly the surplus deficit shown above assumes that the Group will obtain economic benefit from, or be required to finance, only a proportion of the surplus or deficit in the Balfour Beatty section of the scheme.
This proportion has been based on the apportionment of the surplus deficit which has already been agreed together with the relevant provisions of the Trust Deed and Rules and Trustee guidelines regarding future surplus apportionments and deficit nancing.

The assets and liabilities of the dened contribution section are included within the reported results of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund.
Due to the size of the membership of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund BBPF 37,833 members at 31 December 2005 the schemes actuary undertakes regular mortality investigations based on the experience exhibited by pensioners of the BBPF and is able to make statistically credible comparisons of this experience with the mortality rates set out in the various published mortality tables.
The actuary is also able to monitor rates of improvement in the exhibited mortality over time.
As a result of these reviews the Group is able to adopt with a measure of confidence consistent mortality assumptions for its IAS 19 valuations across its various dened benefit schemes.
The mortality tables adopted for these valuations and that of the BBPFs 2004 formal valuation are the 1992 series CMI tables as shown below: With average life Mortality expectancy table at 65 years 1992 series of age Members in receipt of a pension Male PMA92c04 18.4 years Female PFA92c04 21.3 years Members not yet in receipt of a pension Male PMA92c22 20.0 years Female PFA92c22 22.9 years Certain Group employees are members of the Balfour Beatty Shared Cost section of the Railways Pension Scheme Railways Pension Scheme.
The last formal valuation of this dened benefit scheme was carried out by independent actuaries at 31 December 2004 using the projected unit method and disclosed that the market value of the schemes assets represented 92.4% of the benets that had accrued to members of which, being a shared cost scheme, the economic cost to the Group is circa 60% as represented in the schemes assets and liabilities shown below.
This proportion has been based on the apportionment of the surplus which has already been agreed together with the relevant provisions of the Trust Deed and Rules and Trustee guidelines regarding future surplus apportionments.

During the year, 6,837,500 preference shares 2004: 13,710,755 were repurchased for cancellation by the Company for a total consideration of 10,722,218 2004: 19,859,291 at an average price of 156.8p 2004: 144.6p.
The preference shares are convertible at the option of the holder on the first day of the next calendar month following receipt of the conversion notice into new Balfour Beatty plc ordinary shares effectively on the basis of 21.05263 ordinary shares for every 100 preference shares based on the current conversion price of 475p per ordinary share, which is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
Holders are entitled to a preferential dividend equivalent to a gross payment of 10.75p per preference share per annum, payable half yearly.
Any preference shares still outstanding are redeemable on 1 July 2020 at 1 each, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, unless the holder exercises any option granted by the Company to extend the redemption date.
The maximum redemption value of all of the issued and outstanding preference shares, excluding any arrears or accruals of dividend, was 129m at 31 December 2005 2004: 136m.
The Company is entitled to convert all outstanding preference shares into ordinary shares if there are fewer than 44,281,239 preference shares in issue or if the average of the closing mid-market price for a Balfour Beatty plc ordinary share during a 30 day period exceeds 200% of the conversion price.
The preference shares carry no voting rights at a general meeting of the Company, except where the dividend is six months or more in arrears, or where the business of the meeting includes a resolution which directly affects the rights and privileges attached to the preference shares or a resolution for the winding-up of the Company.
On a winding-up of the Company, holders are entitled to receive the sum of 1 per preference share, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, in priority to any payment on any other class of shares.
With the Groups adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005, the preference shares are regarded as a compound instrument, consisting of an equity and a liability component.
The fair value of the liability component at the date of issue, included under non-current liabilities, was estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for a similar non-convertible instrument.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the preference shares and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the value of the equity conversion component, is included in shareholders equity, net of deferred tax.
The liability component recognised on the balance sheet is calculated as follows: 2005 2004 m m Redemption value of shares in issue at 1 January 136 Equity component 19 Deferred tax and interest element 14 Liability component at 1 January 103 Buy-back of preference shares 5 Liability component at 31 December 98 The fair value of the liability component of the preference shares at 31 December 2005 amounted to 98m.
The fair value is calculated using the cash ows discounted at a rate based on the borrowings rate of 13.5%.
Interest expense on the shares is calculated using the effective interest method.
