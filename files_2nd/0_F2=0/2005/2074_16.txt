As of 30 June 2005, the BHP Billiton Group has provided US$110 million 2004: US$102 million for its anticipated share of the planned remediation work, based on a range reasonably foreseeable up to US$138 million 2004: US$138 million, and the Group has paid out US$50 million up to 30 June 2005.
These amounts are based on the provisional equal allocation of costs among the three members of the Pinal Creek Group.
BHP Copper is seeking a judicial restatement of the allocation formula to reduce its share, based upon its belief, supported by relevant external legal and technical advice, that its property has contributed a smaller share of the contamination than the other parties properties.
BHP Copper is contingently liable for the whole of these costs in the event that the other parties are unable to pay.
BHP Copper and the other members of the Pinal Creek Group filed a contribution action in November 1991 in the Federal District Court for the District of Arizona against former owners and operators of the properties alleged to have caused the contamination.
The claim is for an undetermined amount but under current state and federal laws applicable to the case, BHP Copper should recover a significant percentage of the total remediation costs from the Defendants, based upon their operations proportionate contributions to the total contamination in the Pinal Creek drainage basin.
Such action seeks recovery from these historical owners and operators for remediation and source control costs.
BHP Coppers predecessors in interest have asserted a counterclaim in this action seeking indemnity from BHP Copper based upon their interpretation of the historical transaction documents relating to the succession in interest of the parties.
BHP Copper has also filed suit against a number of insurance carriers seeking to recover under various insurance policies for remediation, response, source control, and other costs noted above incurred by BHP Copper.
The reasonable assessment of recovery in the various insurances cases has a range from US$4 million to approximately US$15 million, depending on many factors.
Neither insurance recoveries nor other claims or offsets have been recognised in the financial statements and will not be recognised until such offsets are considered virtually certain of realisation.
The holders of preference shares have limited voting rights if payment of the preference dividends are six months or more in arrears or a resolution is passed changing the rights of the preference shareholders.
Since the merger these shares have been beneficially held by JPMorgan plc.
b BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton Limited each issued one Special Voting Share to facilitate joint voting by shareholders of BHP Billiton Plc and BHP Billiton Limited on Joint Electorate Actions.
c An Equalisation Share has been authorised to be issued to enable a distribution to be made by BHP Billiton Plc to the BHP Billiton Limited Group should this be required under the terms of the DLC merger.
The Directors have the ability to issue the Equalisation Share if required under those terms.
The Constitution of BHP Billiton Limited allows the Directors of that Company to issue a similar Equalisation Share.

Refer notes 19 and 20. b Operating leases are entered into as a means of acquiring access to property, plant and equipment.
Rental payments are generally fixed, but with inflation escalation clauses on which contingent rentals are determined.
Certain leases contain extension and renewal options.
Amounts represent minimum lease payments.
BHP BILLITON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005 129 Notes to Financial Statements continued 26 Commitments continued c The BHP Billiton Group has commitments under operating leases to make payments totalling US$250 million 2004: US$199 million in the next year as follows: 2005 2004 US$M US$M Land and buildings Leases which expire: Within one year 6 5 Between two and five years 12 14 Over five years 25 51 43 70 Other operating leases Leases which expire: Within one year 25 29 Between two and five years 128 61 Over five years 54 39 207 129 27 Pensions and post-retirement medical benefits Pension schemes The BHP Billiton Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The more significant schemes relate to businesses in Australia, South Africa, the US, Canada and Europe.
2005 2004 2003 US$M US$M US$M The pension charge for the year is as follows: Defined contribution schemes 67 53 41 Industry-wide schemes 32 26 23 a Defined benefit schemes Regular cost 46 40 46 Variation cost 37 41 39 Interest cost 17 17 20 165 143 129 a Excludes net exchange gains on net monetary pension assets of US$26 million 2004: US$8 million: 2003: US$39 million.
To the extent that there is a difference between pension cost and contributions paid, an asset and or liability arises.
The accumulated difference recorded in the balance sheet at 30 June 2005 gives rise to an asset of US$312 million 2004: US$282 million and a liability of US$80 million 2004: US$62 million.
The assets of the defined contribution schemes and the industry-wide schemes are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge in respect of these schemes is calculated on the basis of contributions due in the financial year.
The remaining pension schemes are defined benefit schemes.
Some of the defined benefit schemes have their assets held separately in independently administered funds and others are unfunded.
The pension costs and funding for these schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of professionally qualified actuaries based on the most recent actuarial valuations available.
For accounting purposes, the actuarial valuations have determined pension costs for most schemes using the projected unit method.
There are exceptions for some schemes that are closed to new members where the attained age method was used.
The assumptions used varied by scheme.
For the purposes of calculating the pension charge, surpluses or deficiencies are recognised through the variation cost component in future accounting periods as a constant percentage of estimated future payroll over the remaining service life of the employees.
130 BHP BILLITON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005 27 Pensions and post-retirement medical benefits continued Actuarial valuations used for accounting purposes The actuarial valuations used for accounting purposes reflected an aggregate market value at 1 July 2004 of US$1 196 million.
The funding levels of these schemes ranged from 51 per cent to 117 per cent and the overall funding level was 92 per cent.
Formal actuarial valuations Set out below are details for the three largest schemes of the actuarial assumptions and results of the most recent formal valuations for funding purposes.
The actuarial assumptions and results differ from those used for accounting purposes.

b Formal actuarial valuations are only carried out every three years for the BHP Billiton Superannuation Fund.
The next valuation is due as at 30 June 2006.
Post-retirement medical benefits The BHP Billiton Group provides medical benefits, which are not pre-funded, for retired employees and their dependants in South Africa, the US, Canada and Suriname.
The post-retirement benefit charge, net of employees and retirees contributions paid, in respect of these benefits was US$27 million 2004: US$19 million excluding an exchange gain of US$9 million 2004: US$20 million loss.
The charge has been calculated in accordance with UK applicable accounting standards.
Where there is a surplus or deficit between the accrued liability and the provision recorded, the resulting amount is spread forward over future working lifetimes through the variation cost component.
The main actuarial assumptions used in the most recent actuarial valuations of these benefits are as follows: South Africa US Canada Suriname %%%% Ultimate health care inflation rate 7.25 5.00 5.00 3.50 Discount rate 10.00 6.25 6.00 5.50 FRS 17 Retirement Benefits Whilst the SSAP 24 disclosure and measurement principles have been applied in accounting for pensions and post-retirement medical benefits in these financial statements, additional disclosures are provided under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The aim of FRS 17 is to move from a long-term approach under SSAP 24 to a market-based approach in valuing the assets and liabilities arising from an employers retirement benefit obligations and any related funding.
This will impact both the amount and disclosure of the retirement benefits charge in the profit and loss account for the operating costs and financing costs and the statement of total recognised gains and losses STRGL.
The net retirement benefit and a liability will be recognised in full on the balance sheet with a consequential impact on shareholders funds.
Currently, FRS 17 only has to be applied to disclosures.
The BHP Billiton Group does not apply the provisions of FRS 17 for the purposes of measuring pension charge and pension balances in these financial statements.
In the absence of the transition to IFRS, FRS 17 would be first effective in such a manner for the 30 June 2006 financial year.

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidated sale.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
When market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
The estimated fair values have been determined using market information and appropriate valuation methodologies, but are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the BHP Billiton Group could realise in the normal course of business.
