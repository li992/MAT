The Group adopted IFRS with a transition date of 4 January 2004.
In accordance with IFRS1 First-time Adoption of IFRS, the Group has not restated its results for periods ending prior to that date in accordance with IFRS.
An analysis of the adjustments that were made to restate the Groups financial position as at 1 January 2005 and its results for the year then ended in accordance with IFRS is presented in the section of this document entitled Transition to IFRS on pages 108 to 121.
If the financial information presented above for earlier periods was to be restated in accordance with IFRS, the adjustments that would be necessary would be similar in nature to, although may differ in magnitude from, those outlined in that section.
In order to assist comparison, the financial information for those periods and for the year ended 1 January 2005 prepared in accordance with UK GAAP is re-presented above in the format required under IFRS.
