Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust and has been adjusted for the issue of shares during the year.
In accordance with FRS 14, the weighted average number of shares for the 53 weeks to 2 April 2004 has been adjusted to reflect the bonus issues made at the time of the IPO.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the 52 weeks to 1 April 2005.
In the period to 2 April 2004 the dilutive potential ordinary shares were in respect of warrants issued on 30 August 2002 that were exercised on 8 June 2004.

Halfords Annual Report and Accounts 2005 53 Notes to the Financial Statements 20.
Group bank and other borrowings continued The term loan is repayable in six monthly instalments of 10m until 31 March 2009, with the remaining balance being repayable on 17 May 2009.
The loan carries interest of LIBOR London Interbank Offered Rate plus a variable margin of between 0.5% and 0.8% depending on covenant fulfilment.
The revolving credit facility permits borrowings from time to time up to a maximum of 120.0m.
The facility expires on 8 June 2009 and drawings under the facility attract interest at LIBOR plus 0.5% to 0.8%.
Included within bank loans is 16.0m of short-term loans drawn from uncommitted facilities.
The loans attract interest at 5.2% and were used to cover short-term working capital requirements.
On the Companys flotation on 8 June 2004, the Group utilised the net proceeds, together with its own cash balances and its new banking facilities to redeem all of its existing borrowings consisting of 90.4m of deep discount bonds, 0.4m of loan notes and 279.7m of secured bank loans.
As a consequence, a charge of 1.7m see note 7 was made in respect of accelerated amortisation of the issue costs associated with these borrowings.
Financial Instruments Treasury Policy The Groups objective in using financial instruments is to minimise its exposure to financial risk.
The Groups treasury departments main responsibilities are to: Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group: Manage the interest risk of the Groups debt: Invest surplus cash: Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group: and Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash flows.
The main risk arising from the Groups financial instruments is interest rate risk.
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by board approved policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis.
The latest policy review was performed in January 2005.
The Groups debt management policy is to provide an appropriate level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the next three to five years at a reasonable cost and ensure adequate flexibility to meet the changing needs of the enterprise.
Financial Risk The Business Plan and cash flow forecasts are subject to key assumptions such as interest rates and the significance of these risks is dependent upon the level of the trading profit and the strength of the balance sheet.
Interest Rate Risk The Group maintains its policy to minimise interest rate risk on its borrowings and deposits by using interest rate derivatives where appropriate.
The Groups policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants.
The aim is to reduce exposure to the effect of interest rate movements by hedging at least 75% of the following periods net interest rate exposure, whilst maintaining the flexibility to minimise early termination costs.
Foreign Currency Risk The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing direct source purchases of its supplies from the Far East, with most of the trade being specifically US Dollar denominated.
The Groups policy is to manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the business for a minimum period of twelve months forward to ensure the actual costs do not exceed the budget costs by 10% excluding increases in the base cost of the product.
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling business whilst they remain immaterial.
Credit Risk The Groups policy is to minimise the risk that foreign exchange and interest rate derivative counterparties, the holders of surplus cash and the providers of debt will be unable to fulfil their obligations and also, in the case of lenders, unwilling to renegotiate the terms of the borrowings.
The Group ensures that such counterparties used for credit transactions hold at least a double AA credit rating.
54 Halfords Annual Report and Accounts 2005 21.
Financial Instruments continued Liquidity Risk The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when required.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient funding to meet its business plan requirements so that it is not reliant on there being sufficient liquidity in the market when it needs the funding.
Short-term debtors and creditors The Groups creditors and debtors falling due within one year other than bank and other borrowings are excluded from the disclosures below, except for the currency risk disclosures, due to the exclusion of short-term items or because they do not meet the definition of financial assets or liabilities, such as tax balances.
The disclosures below have been made after taking account of interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward contracts.

The Group has a sterling interest rate cap, which matures in June 2009.
In addition to the above, the Groups provisions of 1.6m 2004: 1.0m, for vacant leasehold properties and returns see note 19 met the definition of financial liabilities.
These financial liabilities are considered to be floating rate financial liabilities.
This is because, in establishing the provisions, the cash flows are discounted and the discount rate re-appraised at each half yearly reporting date to ensure that it reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

Any gains or losses arising from changes in exchange rates are included in the book value of the relevant asset or liability.
Changes in the value of the swap as a result of changes in interest rates are not included in the book value of the relevant asset or liability.
For purpose of the above table, the book value of the relevant asset or liability is shown separately from the effect of the currency leg of the cross-currency swap.
Fair value assumptions Interest rate swap, currency swaps and Fair value is based on market price of comparable instruments at the forward foreign currency contracts balance sheet date.
Short-term deposits and borrowings The fair value of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Long-term borrowings In the case of bank loans and other loans, the fair value approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
Halfords Annual Report and Accounts 2005 57 Notes to the Financial Statements 21.
Financial Instruments continued Hedges The Halfords Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: Interest rate risk - using interest swaps and a cap.
Forward foreign currency contracts are also used for currency exposures on next years expected sales.
All the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions or positions.
Under the Groups accounting policy, foreign currency transactions, which are hedged using forward foreign currency contracts are translated at the contracted rates.
Consequently, the carrying value of the relevant asset or borrowings effectively includes the gain or loss on the hedging instrument.

Equity share capital continued Potential Issue of Ordinary Shares The Company has two employee share option schemes, which were set up following the Companys IPO.
The Halfords Company Share Option Scheme is a discretionary option scheme under which the Renumeration Committee may select full time Directors and employees to be granted options.
Options were granted to employees on 2 June 2004, and as at 1 April 2005 options on 6,050,203 Ordinary Shares were outstanding under the scheme.
Options granted under the scheme can be exercisable at 2.60 per share provided performance conditions are met.
The scheme has set a three year performance condition of an earnings per share growth target.
For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in the defined EPS over the period is not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 6% per year.
In the case of grants in excess of 150% of basic salary, the part of the options in excess of 150% of basic salary can only be exercised in full if the increase over the period is not less than RPI plus 10% per year.
For increases in excess of 6%, but less than 10%, a proportion of the option in excess of 150% of salary can be exercised.
Options may be exercised within 7 years of the performance conditions being satisfied.
Early exercise of the options is allowed if an optionholder ceases to be employed by reason of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or on the sale of his employing company or business.
Options on 16,750 Ordinary Shares were exercised in the period and options on 490,000 Ordinary Shares lapsed.
The Halfords Sharesave Scheme is a Save-As-You-Earn scheme and is open to all full time directors and employees with eligible employment service.
Options were granted to employees on 7 June 2004, and as at 1 April 2005 1,364,861 options were outstanding under the scheme.
Options may be exercised under the scheme at 2.64 per share if the option holder completes his saving contract for a period of three years for a period of six months thereafter.
Special provisions allow early exercise in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the company or business which employs the optionholder is transferred out of the Group, or in the event of a change of control, reconstruction or winding up of the Company.
On 15 February 2005 and 27 April 2005 the Company applied for blocklisting of a total of 1,000,000 Ordinary Shares of 1p each to to be admitted on issuance to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange market for listed securities.
The Shares will be issued under the Companys share schemes and when issued, will rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary Shares of the Company.
