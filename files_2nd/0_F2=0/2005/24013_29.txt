These are valued in accordance with the policies set out in note 2 on the accounts.
It is in the nature of private equity and similar unlisted investments that they may be loss making, with no certainty of survival, and that they may prove difficult to realise.
The concept of fair value as applied to such investments is not precise and their ultimate realisation may be at a value significantly different from that used in the accounts.
