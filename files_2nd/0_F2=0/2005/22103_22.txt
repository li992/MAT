Financial risk factors The Groups investment activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk, price risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group does not hold any derivatives, other than the convertible securities disclosed below.
Market risk currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the euro and the $ US dollar, from its investment activities.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future investment transactions, and recognised assets and liabilities are denominated in currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
To reduce the foreign exchange risk arising from future investment transactions, cash and cash equivalents are split by currency according to the anticipated long-term requirements.
At the year end 85.2 million was held in sterling 2004: 59.2 million, 84.6 million was held in euro 2004: 47.9 million, and 19.6 million in $ US dollar 2004: 17.7 million.
The currency exposure of the financial investments is shown below.
Note 9 on page 48 shows the geographical split of investments.
Market risk price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future valuations of the financial investments held by the Group and classified on the balance sheet at fair value through profit or loss, in accordance with the valuation policy as stated on page 19, cash equivalents are valued based on prevailing market prices.
Market risk interest rate risk The majority of the financial investments are fixed interest bearing: as a result, the Group is not subject to significant amounts of risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
Any excess cash and cash equivalents are invested at short-term market interest rates, further reducing such risks.
In addition, the Group holds preferred equity shares, which are classified above either as fixed rate securities or equity dependent on their terms.
