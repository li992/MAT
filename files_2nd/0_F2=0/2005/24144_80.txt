d Basis of calculating capital requirements for Life & Pensions business Each Life and Pensions company has to hold sufficient capital to meet its regulatory capital requirements.
For the FPLP With Profits Fund, the capital requirement is the risk capital margin RCM which amounts to 276m 2004: 279m.
This is calculated on set criteria of adverse scenarios laid down by the FSA the market risk scenarios tested are what would happen if property prices fall by 12.5%, equity prices fall by 20%, corporate bonds spreads increase by 5.22%, fixed interest yields rise 0.7% and persistency increases by 32.5%.
The RCM is based on the asset mix at the year-end and takes into account hedging strategies and the actions management would take in the event of particular adverse market conditions.

In 2004, an additional capital component of 253m was required to bring the realistic peak of 148 m in line with the regulatory peak of 401 m as set out below.
