Notes to the Company financial statements C1.
Changes in accounting policy Share-based payments The Company adopted FRS20 Share-based Payment during the year, which requires that the Company recognise a charge for share options granted on or after 7th November 2002 that had not vested as at 1st January 2005.
The fair value of these options has been calculated using the models as detailed in note 19 of the Group financial statements on pages 63 to 65.
The charge is spread over the vesting period and is adjusted to reflect the actual and expected level of vesting.
The resultant charge to operating profit for the year ended 31st December 2004 in respect of share-based payments was 48,000, including 23,000 in respect of the Companys expected liability for National Insurance on unapproved options.
An estimate of the tax base of share options at the end of the period is determined by reference to the market value of the related share and the exercise price of the option at the reporting date multiplied by the vesting period that has lapsed.
The deductible temporary difference results in the recognition of a deferred tax asset.
The deferred tax asset, of the Company, at 31st December 2003 was 6,000 and at 31st December 2004, 15,000.
The Company recharges its subsidiaries for the share-based payments charge of their employees.
The costs recharged in the year ended 31st December 2003 were 0.2m and in the year ended 31st December 2004 were 0.4m.
The resultant increase in net assets in respect of the above changes was 0.2m at 31st December 2003 and 0.6m as at 31st December 2004.
Dividends The Company adopted FRS21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date during the year, which requires that only dividends declared before the balance sheet date can be recorded as a liability.
The final dividend is not declared until after the year end and consequently there is a requirement to remove the liability for final dividends for the years ended 31st December 2003 and 2004 respectively.
The impact of this adjustment is to increase net assets by 24.0m at 31st December 2003 and by 26.9m at 31st December 2004.
Swap arrangements The Company adopted FRS26 Financial Instruments: Measurement during the year, which applies as the Company enters into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Companys sources of finance.
As a result of the adoption of FRS26 Financial Instruments: Measurement the Company is required to record the swap arrangements on the balance sheet.
The swap arrangements are designated as a hedge against changes in future cash flows as a result of currency movements.
Gains and losses on the fair value of these swap arrangements are taken to reserves until realised.
The adoption of this standard, which has no net impact on the income statement, results in the following changes to the Company balance sheet: As at As at 31st December 1st January 2004 2004 m m Adjustment to record US dollar debt at amortised cost 9.8 6.0 Recognition of swap arrangements on balance sheet 9.4 4.3 0.4 1.7 Represented by recognition of hedging reserves 0.4 1.7 C2.
