The relative ownership of these preference shares has resulted in a re-alignment of balances between NV and PLC.
b From 1 January 2005, Unilever has adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation which requires preference shares that provide for a xed preference dividend to be classied as borrowings and preference dividends to be recognised in the income statement.
In accordance with the transition rules for IAS 32, 2004 has not been restated.
c The share-based compensation credit relates to the reversal of the non-cash charge recorded against operating profit in respect of the fair value of share options and awards granted to employees.
d During 2002, as part of the legal and scal integration of the Bestfoods businesses, a number of internal ownership changes took place.
These internal transactions, which took place at fair value, did not involve any third party and therefore had no effect on the results or net assets of the consolidated Unilever Group.
The historical cost of the net assets of the business transferred by PLC was greater than the historical cost of the net assets of the business transferred by NV.
As it would be inappropriate to recognise revaluations to assets and liabilities of the Group arising from internal transactions, this imbalance led to NV recording an unrealised gain of 1 646 million on the transfer, while PLC recorded an equal and opposite goodwill balance which is eliminated on consolidation.
Further re-organisations in subsequent years have produced similar types of adjustments.
Cumulative goodwill written off directly to reserves prior to the transition to IFRSs on 1 January 2004 was 5 199 million for NV and 2 063 million for PLC.
