c Share-based payments The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees, for awards granted after November 7, 2002, is measured at fair value on the date of grant and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
For awards evaluated on non-market conditions or no performance criteria, an expense is ultimately only recognised for awards which vest.
Where an award is dependent upon a market condition, the cost of the award is recognised irrespective of whether the award vests unless the employee leaves during the vesting period.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
d Dividends Dividends attributable to the shareholders are taken directly to equity when declared.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
e Foreign currencies Assets, liabilities, revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transactions.

Exchange differences arising are taken to the profit and loss account.
f Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, except where it is required to reflect a provision for a permanent diminution in value.
