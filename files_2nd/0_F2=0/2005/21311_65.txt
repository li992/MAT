Securitisations Loans and advances to customers include balances that have been securitised but not derecognised, comprising both UK and overseas residential mortgages and commercial and credit card loans.
Beneficial interests in the loans were transferred to special purpose entities which in turn issued floating rate debt securities.
Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries are not obliged to support any losses that may be suffered by the noteholders and do not intend to offer such support.
The floating rate noteholders only receive payments of interest and principal to the extent that the special purpose vehicles have received sufficient funds from the transferred loans and after certain expenses have been met.
In the event of a deficiency, they have no recourse whatsoever to the Group.
A proportion of the Barclaycard personal credit card and charge card portfolio in the UK was also securitised.
The noteholders in this securitisation have a proportionate interest in each balance in the portfolio.
The total amounts of loans subject to securitisation are 18,594m 2004: 4,314m and the related funding received is 18,420m 2004: 3,859m see Note 33, included in Debt Securities in issue.
Of the total loans securitised in 2005, 5bn relates to the securitisation of commercial loans utilising a credit default swap.
Noteholders have exposure to the credit risk of the securitised commercial loan portfolio and in the event of a loss, have no recourse to the Group.
The Bank participates in the securitisation through the provision of administration and other services, the provision of interest rate and currency swaps and in the form of unsecured loan financing which is subordinate to the interests of the floating rate noteholders.
