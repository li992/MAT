Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation a Accounting policies The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain tangible fixed assets, and, except as disclosed below, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable UK accounting standards.
The Groups accounting policies are unchanged compared with the year ended 31 March 2004, apart from the adoption of UITF 38 and UITF 17 as revised note 38. b Discontinued activities There were no activities classified as discontinued during the year or in the comparative period.
Basis of consolidation The Groups financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
An undertaking is regarded as a subsidiary undertaking if the Company has control over its operating and financial policies.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Companys own profit and loss account is not presented in these financial statements.
An undertaking is regarded as a joint venture if the Group has joint control over its operating and financial policies and as an associate if the Group holds a participating interest and has significant influence, but not control, over its operating and financial policies.
Significant influence generally exists where the Group holds more than 20% and less than 50% of the shareholders voting rights.
Joint ventures and associates are accounted for under the equity method whereby the Groups profit and loss account includes its share of their profits and losses and the Groups balance sheet includes its share of their net assets shown gross in the case of joint ventures.
Unless stated otherwise, business combinations are accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting whereby the Groups results include the results of the acquired business from the effective date of acquisition.
Where a business is sold, its results are included in the Groups results to the effective date of disposal.
Goodwill Goodwill arises under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and represents the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration and the interest acquired by the Group in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at the date of acquisition.
On acquisitions completed after 26 September 1998, goodwill is capitalised and amortised to the profit and loss account over its useful economic life not exceeding 20 years.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings is shown within intangible fixed assets.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures and associates is included in their carrying value on the Groups balance sheet.
On acquisitions completed on or before 26 September 1998, goodwill was written off directly to reserves and has not been reinstated.
Goodwill not previously recognised in the profit and loss account is taken into account when calculating the profit or loss on the subsequent disposal or termination of acquired businesses.
Patents and other intellectual property Patents and other intellectual property are shown at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Where the assets are acquired as part of a business combination, historical cost is based on their fair values as at the date of the combination.
Amortisation of the assets is recognised on a basis over the period of their expected benefit, not exceeding 20 years.
Sales Sales comprise the amount receivable in the ordinary course of business, net of value added and sales taxes, for goods and services provided.
Sales are recognised at the point at which the Group has performed its obligations in connection with the contractual terms of the sales agreement, and in exchange obtains the right to consideration.
Stock Stock is valued at the lower of direct cost together with attributable overheads and net realisable value.
Tangible fixed assets Certain tangible fixed assets are carried at amounts based upon valuations recognised before the adoption of FRS15 Tangible Fixed Assets.
As is permitted by the transitional provisions of FRS15, these revaluations have not been updated.
Finance costs directly attributable to the construction of tangible fixed assets are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
The depreciation charge is calculated so as to allocate the cost or revalued amount of tangible fixed assets systematically over their remaining useful economic lives using the straight line method.
These asset lives are reviewed at the end of each financial year.
66 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2005 1 Accounting policies continued The following asset lives are used: Freehold land : No depreciation Freehold buildings : 20 to 50 years Leasehold property : Period of the lease Bulk liquid storage tanks : 12 to 20 years Plant and machinery : 3 to 28 years Leases Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated in accordance with the Groups depreciation policy.
Operating lease costs are charged to profit as incurred.
Research and development All expenditure on research and development is charged to profit as incurred.
Retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes and, in the US, provides retirement healthcare and life assurance benefits.
The expected cost of these arrangements is charged to the profit and loss account, on the advice of actuaries, so as to accrue the cost over the service lives of employees on the basis of a constant percentage of earnings.
Variations from the regular cost are spread over the expected remaining service lives of current employees in the scheme.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on a full provision basis on timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the accounts and their recognition for tax purposes that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences or on timing differences arising on property revaluation surpluses where there is no commitment to sell the asset, gains on asset sales that are rolled over into replacement assets for tax purposes or on unremitted profits of overseas subsidiaries.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be sufficient future taxable profits to permit tax relief of the underlying timing differences.
Where appropriate, deferred tax assets and liabilities are stated on a discounted basis.
Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the last day of the financial period the closing rate except when they are hedged by an open foreign exchange contract, in which case the rate of exchange specified in the contract is used.
The profits of overseas companies are translated at the annual average of daily exchange rates and the difference when compared with that arising from the use of closing rates, together with differences on exchange arising from the translation of the opening balance sheets of overseas companies at year-end rates, are taken directly to reserves.
Other profits and losses on exchange are credited or charged to the profit and loss account.
Debt instruments Debt instruments are stated at the amount of net proceeds received after deduction of issue costs.
Issue costs and any discount to face value arising on issue, or any premium payable on maturity, are amortised evenly in the profit and loss account over the term of the debt.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses a range of derivative financial instruments both for trading purposes and to hedge exposures to financial risks, being interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price risks arising in the normal course of business.
The accounting treatment for these instruments is dependent on whether they are entered into for trading or hedging purposes.
A derivative instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when it reduces the risk profile of an underlying exposure of the Group and there exists a demonstrable link to an underlying transaction, group of transactions or specified future transaction or transactions.
Specified future transactions must be probable of arising for the associated derivative to be accounted for as a hedge.
A discussion on how the Group manages its financial risks is included in the Operating and Financial Review.
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2005 67 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments are accounted for as follows: Commodity trading activities The Group uses financial instruments in sugar and maize for trading purposes.
Open financial and physical trading positions are marked to market using externally derived market prices.
Movements in fair value are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account, with corresponding debtors or creditors included within the balance sheet.
The recognition of unrealised gains arising on financial instruments in the profit and loss account does not comply with the requirements of Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985, which only permits recognition of unrealised gains through the revaluation reserve.
However, the directors consider that the nature of the Groups trading activities are such that, in order for the accounts to show a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the results for the year, it is necessary to depart from the requirements of the Companies Act.
The impact of this departure in the current year is a profit of 1.1 million 2004 loss of 1.8 million.
The cumulative impact on distributable reserves is an increase of 3.5 million 2004 2.5 million.
Commodity hedging activities The Group engages in sugar, maize, wheat and energy financial instruments to hedge against risks arising within the operations of the business.
The instruments are matched to the risks that they are designed to hedge, with gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account in the same period as the income and costs of the underlying hedged transactions.
Treasury hedging activities The Group uses various financial instruments to manage exposures to interest rates arising on underlying debt and cash positions or probable future commitments and foreign exchange risks arising on foreign currency assets and borrowings, foreign currency forecasted transactions and the retranslation of overseas net investments.
All instruments are used for hedging purposes to reduce the risk profile on existing underlying exposures and probable future commitments in line with the Groups risk management policies.
The Group does not engage in the use of treasury financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Group uses financial instruments to manage the interest rate risk attached to its borrowings.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Changes in the instruments fair value are not recognised.
The Group uses cross-currency swap instruments to manage the currency risk attached to its borrowings.
All cross-currency swap instruments are matched with their underlying hedged item.
These instruments are translated at period-end exchange rates: gains and losses arising are included in the measurement of the related liabilities and dealt with in the Group profit and loss account.
Where foreign currency borrowings are used to finance foreign equity investments, differences arising from the movement in exchange rates during the year from translation to sterling of the foreign currency borrowings and similar instruments used to finance long-term foreign equity investments are taken directly to distributable reserves and reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses up to an amount equivalent to the differences arising on the underlying foreign equity investments.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of future cash flows related to operating activity denominated in foreign currencies.
The gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts hedging anticipated exposures are deferred until the date the underlying transaction being hedged is recorded in the Group balance sheet.
Forward foreign exchange contracts hedging existing transactions are revalued to period-end spot rates together with the existing transactions, and the resulting gains and losses are recognised in the Group profit and loss account immediately.
All premiums or fees, paid or received, in respect of financial instruments are accounted for over the life of the matched underlying asset, liability, income or cost.
Where the matched underlying asset, liability, income or cost ceases to exist, or is no longer considered likely to exist in the future, the hedging instrument is sold.
Any profit or loss on the sale is recognised in the profit and loss account as part of operating profit.

No profit or loss arose on the sale of these debtors.
The Group is not obliged and does not intend to support any credit-related losses arising from the debts against which cash has been advanced.
The providers of the finance have confirmed in writing that, in the event of default by a debtor, they will only seek repayment of cash advanced from the remainder of the pool of debts in which they hold an interest, and that repayment will not be sought from the Group in any other way.

The Group has further undrawn committed multicurrency facilities of 327 million 2004 277 million which expire between two and five years.
These facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.
The facilities may only be withdrawn in the event of specified events of default.
In addition, the Group has substantial uncommitted facilities.
At 31 March 2005, a US subsidiary had an outstanding external borrowing of US$525 million 2004 US$525 million, the principal amount of which is guaranteed by another Group company by way of a credit linked deposit with a bank.
The guarantee results in this borrowing being in substance non-recourse to the Group as to principal in the event of default and accordingly the borrowing and deposit are offset in these accounts.
At 31 March 2005, the same US subsidiary also had outstanding a five-year bank borrowing of US$275 million 2004 US$275 million drawn down in March 2001 in the form of a registered loan note issuance.
Repayment of the loan note is secured on a portfolio of sovereign debt in the same principal amount owned by a third party, the purchase of which was financed indirectly by another Group company subscribing to a five-year loan note which will, in the event of a default, be exchangeable for the US subsidiarys loan note.
In a similar manner to the transaction described in the previous paragraph, the agreements involved are such that this borrowing is in substance non-recourse to the Group as to principal in the event of default and accordingly the borrowing and note subscription are offset in these accounts.

Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2005 81 Notes to the financial statements continued 24 Retirement benefits a Retirement benefit schemes The Group maintains pension plans for its operations throughout the world.
Most of these arrangements are defined benefit pension schemes with retirement, disability, death and termination income benefits.
The retirement income benefits are generally a function of years of employment and final salary.
The principal schemes are funded and their assets held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The schemes are funded in line with local practice and contributions are assessed in accordance with local independent actuarial advice.
The schemes operated by the Group are subject to independent actuarial valuation at regular intervals using consistent assumptions appropriate to conditions prevailing in the relevant country.
The Group also maintains defined contribution pension schemes and some fully insured pension schemes and multi-employer pension arrangements.
On 1 April 2002, the main UK scheme was closed to new members.
A defined contribution pension scheme has been established to provide pension benefits to new UK employees.
Under the projected unit method, the FRS17 service cost of the closed scheme will increase as the members approach retirement.
The Groups subsidiaries in the US provide unfunded retirement medical and life assurance benefits to their employees.
b Accounting and disclosures The Group accounts for retirement benefits in accordance with SSAP24 Accounting for Pensions and the related disclosures are set out in section c below.
Pension and retirement healthcare costs are analysed in note 6.
The Group has adopted the transitional disclosure requirements of FRS17 Retirement Benefits.
It differs from SSAP24 principally with regard to the choice of assumptions and in that differences between the market value of the assets and liabilities of the retirement benefit schemes are recognised immediately in the balance sheet whereas they are recognised on a smoothed basis through the profit and loss account under SSAP24.
The Group is not required to account for retirement benefits under FRS17 as full implementation has been deferred, but is required to present certain transitional disclosures which are set out in section d overleaf.
c SSAP24 disclosures i Pensions The main scheme is the Tate & Lyle Group Pension Scheme which provides benefits related to service and final salary.
The most recent valuation of the scheme was prepared as at 31 March 2003 by a qualified independent actuary using the projected unit method.
In that valuation, the investments were taken at their market value and the discount rate used to assess the level of the liabilities was set by reference to the expected return on the current market value of the assets.
The principal actuarial assumptions made were that, over the long term, the total return on investments currently held by the scheme will be 6.3% per annum, the total return on future investments will be 6.1% per annum, pensionable salaries will increase at 4.3% per annum and the rate of future retail price inflation will be 2.5% per annum.
Provision for the increases guaranteed under the rules was made by assuming that pensions would increase at the rate of 2.5% per annum.
The actuarial valuation identified a deficit of 13 million under SSAP24.
During the year, regular contributions of 7 million were supplemented by additional contributions of 10 million.
Contributions at this level are expected to continue for a period of five years from 31 March 2003.
An actuarial valuation is being performed as at 31 March 2005.
Overall, at the date of their most recent actuarial valuations, the market value of the assets of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes in surplus was 208 million and of those schemes in deficit was 675 million.
The actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 106% and 90% respectively of the benefits accrued to members, after allowing for future salary increases.
ii Healthcare Valuations of the retirement healthcare schemes operated by the Groups US subsidiaries are conducted annually by a qualified independent actuary using the projected unit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the most recent valuation as at 1 April 2004 were that medical costs would increase by 9% in 2004 reducing ultimately to 5.0% and a discount rate of 6.25% was used.

1,702 million 2004 1,403 million.
Other trade guarantees have been given in the normal course of business by the Group and by Tate & Lyle PLC at both 31 March 2005 and 31 March 2004.
These are excluded from the figures given above and are in respect of Customs and Excise and Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce bonds, ECGD recourse agreements, letters of credit and tender and performance bonds.
The Group is subject to claims and litigation generally arising in the ordinary course of its business, some of which are for substantial amounts.
All such actions are strenuously defended but provision is made for liabilities that are considered likely to arise on the basis of current information and legal advice and after taking into account the Groups insurance arrangements.
Whilst there is always uncertainty as to the outcome of any claim or litigation, it is not expected that claims and litigation existing at the balance sheet date will have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
The contingent liability arising from the outstanding claim against, inter alia, A E Staley alleging high fructose corn syrup price fixing disclosed in the 2004 annual report was settled by the Group during the year.
The Group emphatically denied involvement in any wrongdoing, but settled with great reluctance to ensure an end to this lengthy action and to avoid the risk and uncertainty that a US jury trial would have involved.
The resulting charge of 55 million has been included as an operating exceptional item, as reported in note 5 on page 70.
26 Financial commitments The Group leases railway wagons, vehicles, plant and equipment and office buildings through non-cancellable operating leases.
Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses, renewal options and purchase options.

In each period, depreciation relating to these revaluation surpluses is charged to operating profit and a corresponding transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to the profit and loss account reserve.
In 2005 the depreciation charge was 1 million 2004 1 million.
The merger reserve arose on the acquisition of the minority interests in the former Amylum and Staley in 2000 and is non-distributable.

Fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms-length transaction between informed and willing parties, excluding accrued interest, and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
All debt and financial instruments used to manage the interest rate and currency of borrowings with a maturity of less than three months after the balance sheet date are assumed to have a fair value equal to the book value.
The book values are the amounts recorded in the balance sheet and include premium payments or receipts which are recognised over the period to which the relevant instrument relates.
Initial margin deposits held by brokers as collateral in respect of open futures positions are excluded from the currency risk disclosures.
The major financial risks facing the Group and the objectives and policies for holding financial instruments are discussed in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 10 to 37.

The book value of these swaps at 31 March 2005 was 13 million asset 2004 14 million asset and the fair value was 15 million asset 2004 16 million asset.
ii The fair values of commodity derivatives are calculated as the product of the volume and the difference between their strike or traded price and the corresponding market prices.
The market price is based upon the corresponding closing price of that market.
Where there is no terminal market and or the market is illiquid, the market price is based upon management estimates, taking into consideration all relevant current market and economic factors.

98 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2005 36 Sale of subsidiaries During 2005, there were no Group disposals.
In 2004, the Group disposed of Orsan S. A. its European MSG business.
The profit recognised during 2004 on disposal of Orsan S. A. was as follows: million Sale proceeds 41 Net assets sold: Tangible fixed assets 41 Stock 10 Debtors 1 Creditors 9 Provisions 2 Profit on disposal Sale proceeds recognised during the year comprised: million Cash 41 Additional net payments relating to prior year disposals 2 Total 39 Orsan S. A. contributed the following amounts to cash flows during the year prior to disposal: million Cash flow from operating activities 4 Capital expenditure and financial investment 6 Net cash inflow before financing 10 37 Acquisitions a Sucralose In April 2004, the Group completed the realignment of its sucralose activities with McNeil Nutritionals McNeil, a Johnson & Johnson company, achieved through the separation of that business into its constituent Ingredient and Tabletop parts.
The Group acquired the sucralose Ingredients business and manufacturing assets from McNeil for an initial consideration of 72 million including transaction costs.
In addition, there are contingent deferred payments and receipts that reflect continued participation in the success of each partys ongoing sucralose activities.
The formal unwinding of the earlier Sucralose Global Alliance arrangements, which included the termination of certain pre-existing contractual rights and obligations as well as mutual intellectual property and other asset transfers, gave rise to a tax liability of 19 million in the year ended 31 March 2005.
A related deferred tax asset with a discounted value of 15 million has been recognised at 31 March 2005 reflecting a timing difference between the accounting and taxable profits in the current year.

The book value of the assets has been taken from the management accounts of McNeil Nutritionals at the date of acquisition at actual exchange rates on that date.
The fair value adjustments relate to the recognition of patents and write down of fixed assets to market value.
The deferred consideration is payable upon the achievement of certain minimum targets in respect of ingredient sales of sucralose made by the Group.
This represents the Groups best estimate of the liability arising from this obligation.
Further performance related payments up to a maximum of $200 million may become payable between 2 April 2004 and 1 April 2009.
Initial estimates of the deferred consideration will be revised as further and more certain information becomes available, with corresponding adjustments to goodwill.
As part of the transaction, the Group receives deferred receipts from McNeil dependent upon sales of sucralose tabletop products made by McNeil for ten years from the date of completion of the transaction.
Receipts, which are expected to at least match the deferred payments, are only recognised in the periods in which they are earned.
In the year to 31 March 2005, the acquired business contributed operating profit before interest, exceptional items and amortisation of 52 million to the Sweeteners & Starches Americas segment.
The business was acquired on 2 April 2004.
For the year ended 31 December 2003, profit before interest, exceptional items and amortisation was 21 million on a pro forma basis.
b Other During the year, the Group acquired the remaining 80% shareholding in Tate & Lyle South Africa for 3 million.
Net assets of 1 million were acquired, giving rise to 2 million goodwill on consolidation.
38 Prior period adjustments The Group has adopted Urgent Issues Task Force, Abstract 38 UITF38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts in the year to 31 March 2005.
As a result, shares in the Company held through an employee share scheme trust which were previously reported as investments are now recorded as a deduction from equity shareholders funds.
At 31 March 2004, the carrying value of these shares was 38 million which has been set against the profit and loss reserve of the balance sheet.
The comparative figures for balance sheet, profit and loss reserve and classifications within the cash flow statement have been restated to reflect the change in treatment such that shareholders funds at 31 March 2004 have been reduced by 38 million.
The Group has also adopted UITF17 as revised which results in the cost of the awards made under the Groups share schemes now being calculated with reference to the fair value of the shares at the date of award rather than the cost of the shares purchased by the Group.
The impact of this revision on the charges made in respect of the share schemes is not material.
