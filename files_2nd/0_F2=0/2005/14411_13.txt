R310 SOCO 44-72 3 22 06 9:23 PM Page 47 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 General information SOCO International plc is a company incorporated in Great Britain under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given inside the back cover.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in Note 6 and in the Review of Operations and Financial Review on pages 7 to 14 and 20 to 23, respectively.
2 Significant accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for the first time.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in Note 32.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis.
For the first time the financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of each of the Companys subsidiary undertakings.
The functional currency of the Company remains GB pounds although its financial statements are now presented in US dollars.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources has been adopted early for 2005.
At the date of approval of these financial statements the Group has not applied the following IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations which are in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease IFRIC 5 Right to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 The adoption of these IFRS and IFRICs in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
b Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the accounts of SOCO International plc and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to the balance sheet date.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method whereby the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and the consideration given are recognised in the Group accounts at their fair values as at the date of the acquisition.
c Investments Except as stated below, non-current investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
d Interests in joint ventures Jointly controlled entities are those for which the Group exercises joint control over the operating and financial policies.
These investments are dealt with by proportionate consolidation whereby the consolidated financial statements include the appropriate share of these companies assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line by line basis.
Where a consolidated member of the Group participates in unincorporated joint ventures, that member accounts directly for its share of the jointly controlled assets, liabilities and related income and expenses which are then similarly included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
e Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and no depreciation is charged.
f Revenue Revenue represents the fair value of the Groups share of oil and gas sold during the year.
To the extent revenue arises from test production during an evaluation programme, an amount is charged from evaluation costs to cost of sales so as to reflect a zero net margin.
Investment revenue is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
SOCO International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 47 R310 SOCO 44-72 3 22 06 9:23 PM Page 48 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 Significant accounting policies continued g Tangible and intangible non-current assets Oil and gas exploration, evaluation and development expenditure The Group uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration, evaluation and development expenditure, whereby all expenditures incurred in connection with the acquisition, exploration, evaluation and development of oil and gas assets, including directly attributable overheads, and interest payable and exchange differences directly related to financing development projects, are capitalised in separate geographical cost pools.
Cost pools are established on the basis of geographical area having regard to the operational and financial organisation of the Group.
Intangible acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs incurred in a geographical area where the Group has no established cost pool are initially capitalised as intangible non-current assets except where they fall outside the scope of IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources whereby they are expensed as incurred subject to other guidance under IFRS.
Tangible non-current assets used in acquisition, exploration and evaluation are classified with tangible non-current assets as property, plant and equipment.
To the extent that such tangible assets are consumed in exploration and evaluation the amount reflecting that consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset.
Upon successful conclusion of the appraisal programme and determination that commercial reserves exist, such costs are transferred to tangible non-current assets as property, plant and equipment.
Exploration and evaluation costs carried forward are assessed for impairment as described below.
Proceeds from the disposal of oil and gas assets are credited against the relevant cost centre.
Any overall surplus arising in a cost centre is credited to the income statement.
Depreciation and depletion Depletion is provided on oil and gas assets in production using the unit of production method, based on proven and probable reserves, applied to the sum of the total capitalised exploration, evaluation and development costs, together with estimated future development costs at current prices.
Oil and gas assets that have a similar economic life are aggregated for depreciation purposes.
Impairment of value Where there has been a change in economic conditions or in the expected use of an asset that indicates a possible impairment in an asset, management tests the recoverability of the net book value of the asset by comparison with the estimated discounted future net cash flows based on managements expectations of future oil prices and future costs.
Any identified impairment is charged to the income statement.
Intangible exploration and evaluation assets are considered for impairment at least annually by reference to the indicators in IFRS 6.
Where there is an indication of impairment of an exploration and evaluation asset which is within a geographic pool where the Group has tangible oil and gas assets with commercial proven and probable reserves, the exploration asset is assessed for impairment together with all other cash generating units and related tangible and intangible assets in that geographic pool and any balance remaining after impairment is amortised over the proven and probable reserves of the pool.
Where the exploration asset is in an area where the Group has no established pool, the exploration asset is tested for impairment separately and, where determined to be impaired, is written off.
Other tangible non-current assets Other tangible non-current assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates calculated to write off the cost of those assets, less residual value, over their expected useful lives.
Decommissioning The decommissioning provision is calculated as the net present value of the Groups share of the expenditure expected to be incurred at the end of the producing life of each field in the removal and decommissioning of the production, storage and transportation facilities currently in place.
The cost of recognising the decommissioning provision is included as part of the cost of the relevant property, plant and equipment and is thus charged to the income statement on a unit of production basis in accordance with the Groups policy for depletion and depreciation of tangible non-current assets.
Period charges for changes in the net present value of the decommissioning provision arising from discounting are included in finance costs.
h Changes in estimates The effects of changes in estimates on the unit of production calculations are accounted for prospectively over the estimated remaining proven and probable reserves of each pool.
i Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Overlifts and underlifts of crude oil are recorded at market value.
j Leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
SOCO International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 48 R310 SOCO 44-72 3 22 06 9:23 PM Page 49 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2 Significant accounting policies continued k Share-based payments In accordance with the transitional provisions, the Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 to all grants after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
Under these requirements, equity-settled awards under share-based incentive plans are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the performance period along with a corresponding increase in equity.
Fair value is measured using an option pricing model taking into consideration managements best estimate of the expected life of the option and the estimated number of shares that will eventually vest.
l Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to recover the asset.
Deferred tax is not recognised where an asset or liability is acquired in a transaction which is not a business combination for an amount which differs from its tax value.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
m Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group does not currently utilise derivative financial instruments.
There are no material financial assets and liabilities for which differences between carrying amounts and fair values are required to be disclosed.
Financial asset at fair value through profit or loss Where a financial instrument is classified as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss it is initially recognised at fair value.
At each balance sheet date the fair value is reviewed and any gain or loss arising is recognised in the income statement.
Period credits for changes in the net present value of the financial asset arising from discounting are included in other gains and losses.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
n Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than US dollars are recorded in US dollars at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than US dollars at the balance sheet date are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date, or if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Any resulting gains and losses are included in net profit or loss for the period.
The results of entities denominated in currencies other than US dollars are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on retranslation at the closing rate of the opening net assets and results of entities denominated in currencies other than US dollars are dealt with through equity and transferred to the Groups retained earnings reserve.
Other foreign exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
o Pension costs The contributions payable in the year in respect of pension costs for defined contribution schemes and other post-retirement benefits are charged to the income statement.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown either as accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
SOCO International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 49 R310 SOCO 44-72 3 22 06 9:23 PM Page 50 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3 Financial risk management The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing financial risks that may affect the Group.
In certain cases the Board delegates responsibility for such reviews and policy setting to the Audit Committee.
The main financial risks affecting the Group are discussed below.
Credit risk The Groups non-current financial assets that are subject to credit risk comprise a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss and other receivables, both arising in respect of the Groups disposal of its Mongolia interest see Note 12.
The Groups and Companys other financial assets comprise investments, trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
The Group seeks to minimise credit risk by only maintaining balances with creditworthy third parties including major multinational oil companies subject to contractual terms in respect of trade receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited as the Board only selects institutions with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies and endeavours to spread cash balances over more than one institution.
The level of deposits held by different institutions is regularly reviewed.
Foreign currency risk The Group primarily conducts and manages its business in US dollars.
Cash balances in Group subsidiaries are usually held in US dollars, but smaller amounts may be held in GB pounds or local currencies to meet immediate operating or administrative expenses, or to comply with local currency regulations.
From time to time the Group may take short term hedging positions to protect the value of any cash balances it holds in non-US dollar currencies.
Liquidity risk The Groups cash requirements and balances are projected for the Group as a whole and for each country in which operations and capital expenditures are conducted.
The Group meets these requirements through an appropriate mix of available funds, equity instruments and debt financing.
The Group will seek to minimise the impact that any debt financings may have on its balance sheet by negotiating borrowings in matching currencies.
Primarily, these are expected to be in US dollar denominations.
The Group further mitigates liquidity risk by entering into arrangements with industry partners thereby sharing costs and risks, and by maintaining an insurance programme to minimise exposure to insurable losses.
Commodity price risk The Groups production is usually sold on spot or near term contracts, with prices fixed at the time of a transfer of custody or on the basis of a monthly average market price.
However the Board may give consideration in certain circumstances to the appropriateness of entering into fixed price, long term marketing contracts.
Although oil prices may fluctuate widely, it is the Groups policy not to hedge crude oil sales unless hedging is required to mitigate financial risks associated with debt financing of its assets or to meet its commitments.
Over time, during periods when the Group sees an opportunity to lock in attractive oil prices, it may engage in limited price hedging.
4 Critical judgements and accounting estimates In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies described in Note 2, management has made judgements that may have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
In particular Note 2 g describes the judgements necessary to implement the Groups policy with respect to the carrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets.
Management considers these assets for impairment at least annually with reference to indicators in IFRS 6.
Note 15 discloses the carrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets.
Note 2 also discusses the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.
In particular Note 2 m describes the accounting policy with respect to financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The key assumptions described in Note 12 that are used in calculating the fair value of the Groups financial asset arising on the disposal of its Mongolia interest are reviewed at least annually.
5 Total revenue An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: 2005 2004 $000s $000s Continuing operations Oil sales 57,160 29,386 Investment revenue 2,042 659 59,202 30,045 Discontinued operations Oil sales 1,498 16,601 Investment revenue 13 60,700 46,659 SOCO International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 50 R310 SOCO 44-72 3 22 06 9:23 PM Page 51 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 6 Segment information Geographical segments Geographical segments form the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
In August 2005 the Group disposed of its Central Asia segment which comprised its Mongolia interest see Note 12.
The results of these segments are therefore included in discontinued operations.
Business segment The Group has one principal business activity being oil and gas exploration and production.
Revenue by destination does not materially differ from revenue by origin.
There are no inter-segment sales.

The amounts payable in respect of non-audit services related to IFRS advice in the amount of US$46,000 2004 - nil, remuneration advice in the amount of US$65,000 2004 - US$74,000, tax compliance and advisory of nil 2004 - US$80,000 and advice in respect of disposals of nil 2004 - US$22,000.
10 Staff costs The average monthly number of employees of the Group including Executive Directors was 15 2004 - 15, of which 12 2004 - 12 were administrative personnel and 3 2004 - 3 were operations personnel.
The average monthly number of employees directly contracted to the Company was 7 2004 - 7 of which 6 2004 - 6 were administrative personnel and 1 2004 - 1 was operations personnel.
Their aggregate remuneration comprised: Group Company 2005 2004 2005 2004 $000s $000s $000s $000s Wages and salaries 4,280 3,568 1,133 815 Social security costs 554 44 126 95 Share-based payment expense see Note 26 521 55 39 38 Other pension costs under money purchase schemes 337 313 87 64 5,692 3,892 1,385 1,012 A proportion of the Groups staff costs are capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
Taxation in other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
During 2004 and 2005 both current and deferred taxation have arisen in overseas jurisdictions only.
SOCO International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 52 R310 SOCO 44-72 3 22 06 9:23 PM Page 53 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 11 Tax continued The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows: 2005 2004 $000s $000s Profit before tax on continuing operations 33,662 14,887 Profit before tax on discontinued operations 181 24,868 33,843 39,755 Profit before tax multiplied by standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2004 - 30% 10,153 11,927 Effects of: Expenses not expected to be utilised as a tax loss 1,423 1,186 Non taxable profit on disposal 58 4,758 Utilisation of tax credits 205 Higher tax rates on overseas earnings 1,906 2,469 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous years 58 435 Tax charge for the year 13,366 10,184 The tax charge in future periods may also be affected by these factors.
The Groups overseas tax rates are higher than those in the UK, primarily because the profits earned in Yemen are taxed at a rate of 35% and those earned in Tunisia were taxed at a rate of 50%.
12 Disposal of Mongolia interest In April 2005 the Group entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement Agreement with an economic effective date of 1 January 2005, to sell its 100% owned subsidiaries SOCO Tamtsag Mongolia, LLC SOTAMO and SOCO Mongolia Ltd SOCO Mongolia to Daqing Oilfield Limited Company Daqing, a subsidiary of PetroChina.
Together SOTAMO and SOCO Mongolia held the Groups Mongolia interest.
In August 2005 the Group completed the transaction.
Under the terms of the Agreement the Group will receive consideration of up to approximately US$93.0 million comprised of cash consideration of US$40.0 million plus a subsequent payment based on total crude oil produced from the Mongolia interest after the effective date in excess of 27.8 million barrels of oil.
The US$40.0 million cash consideration was payable in two tranches.
The first US$30.0 million was paid, less applicable settlement adjustments of US$0.4 million, in August 2005 upon completion.
The second tranche of US$10.0 million was paid into an interest bearing escrow account by Daqing upon completion to be released to the Group 18 months later upon the satisfaction of the condition that no material undisclosed additional liabilities are discovered and is disclosed in the balance sheet under non-current assets as an other receivable.
The remaining consideration is payable, once cumulative production reaches 27.8 million barrels of oil as described above, at the rate of 20% of the average monthly posted marker price for Daqing crude multiplied by the aggregate production for that month, up to a total of approximately US$53.0 million based on the estimated recoverable costs incurred to 31 December 2004, as approved by the Mineral Resources and Petroleum Authority of Mongolia.
The subsequent payment amount is included in non-current assets as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss.
The timescale for the production of crude oil in excess of 27.8 million barrels and the price of Daqing marker crude oil are factors that cannot accurately be predicted.
However, based upon the Directors current estimates of proven and probable reserves from the Mongolia interests and the development scenarios as discussed with the buyer, the Directors believe that the full subsequent payment amount will be payable.
The fair value of the subsequent payment amount was determined using a valuation technique as there is no active market against which direct comparisons can be made.
Assumptions made in calculating the fair value include the factors mentioned above, risked as appropriate, with the resultant cash flows discounted at a commercial risk free interest rate.
The fair value of the financial asset at the date of completion of the sale was US$31.5 million.
As at 31 December 2005 the fair value was US$31.9 million after accounting for the unwinding of the discount see Note 7.
As the Groups Mongolia asset is now classed as a discontinued operation the revenue and cost of sales have been removed from continuing operations.
There is no impact on operating profit as revenue arose from test production during an appraisal programme and an amount was charged from appraisal costs to cost of sales so as to reflect a zero net margin.
Revenue attributable to the Mongolia interest up to the date of completion was US$1.5 million 2004 - US$3.2 million.
Immediately prior to the sale the Groups share of net assets held by the Mongolia interest was US$68.8 million 2004 - US$65.4 million comprising intangible assets of US$71.0 million 2004 - US$71.6 million, current assets of US$ nil 2004 - US$0.7 million, current liabilities of US$0.4 million 2004 - US$5.2 million and longterm provisions of US$1.8 million 2004 - US$1.7 million.
Immediately after completion of the sale the Group recognised cash inflow of US$29.6 million, other receivables of US$10.0 million, a gain of US$0.2 million based on the fair value of the financial asset of US$31.5 million see above and transaction costs of US$2.1 million.

Additional information regarding the schemes is included in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 35 to 41.
The Group recognised total expenses of US$521,000 2004: US$55,000 in respect of the schemes during the year, a proportion of which was capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Awards administered under the SOCO Employment Benefit Trust Trust The Company operates a long term incentive plan LTIP for senior employees of the Group.
Awards vest over a period of 3 years, subject to performance criteria which have been set with reference to the Companys total shareholder return TSR relative to a range of comparator companies.
Consideration may also be given to assessment as to whether the TSR performance is consistent with underlying performance.
Awards are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the award vests.
Certain additional awards are outstanding and exercisable which were granted prior to the introduction of the LTIP.
Awards normally expire at the end of 10 years following the date of grant, subject to the requirement to exercise certain awards prior to 15 March of the year following vesting.
Awards would normally be equity-settled through a transfer at nil consideration of the Companys own shares held by the Trust see Note 24.
The Company has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle awards in cash.
At the beginning of the period 1,837,020 2004 - 2,297,000 awards were outstanding.
The market price and the estimated fair value of awards at date of grant were 8.180 2004 - 3.120 and 2.610 2004 - 0.805, respectively.
The weighted average market price at the date of exercise in 2004 was 3.205.
Awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.81 2004 - 7.54 years.
The fair value of awards at date of grant has been estimated using a binomial option pricing model, based on the market price at date of grant set out above and a nil exercise price.
The future vesting proportion of 31.9% 2004 - 25.8% has been estimated by calculating the expected probability of the Companys TSR ranking relative to its comparators based on modelling each companys projected future share price growth.

Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the Companys shares on the date of grant.
The vesting period is 3 years, subject to performance criteria based on the Companys TSR relative to a range of comparator companies.
Additional share options are outstanding and exercisable that were granted under a previous plan.
Unexercised options expire at the end of a 7 or 10 year period, in accordance with the plan rules.
Options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Options would normally be equity-settled through newly issued shares.
The remaining 290,194 2004 - nil options exercised, being the number of shares that might otherwise be sold in the market to satisfy the participants obligations for exercise price and tax liabilities, of US$840,000 and US$1,837,000, respectively, were satisfied by the Group through the settlement of those obligations.
The Board decided in this instance it was in the best interest of the Company to agree this settlement method with the participants.
The Company has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle options in cash.
Details of options outstanding during the year are as follows: 2005 2004 No.
of share Weighted average No.
The market price and the estimated fair value of options at the date of grant during 2004 were 2.920 and 0.390, respectively.
Options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.30 2004 - 2.13 years.
The fair value of options granted in 2004 has been estimated using a binomial option pricing model, based on the market price at date of grant and exercise price set out above.
An expected future share price volatility of 43% has been utilised based on the calculated historical volatility over the previous 5 years.
Additional inputs to the model include a risk free discount rate of 5%, a dividend yield of nil% and an expected average option life of 5.26 years based on the contractual life adjusted as deemed appropriate for the effects of nontransferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The future vesting proportion of 28.9% has been estimated by calculating the expected probability of the Companys TSR ranking relative to its comparators based on modelling each companys projected future share price growth.

30 Capital commitments At 31 December 2005 the Group had exploration licence commitments not accrued of approximately US$0.6 million 2004 - US$2.3 million.
31 Related party transactions During the year the Company rendered services to Group undertakings in the amount of US$47,000 2004 - US$323,000.
Balances with Group undertakings are disclosed in Note 21.
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated on consolidation.
Transactions with the Directors of the Company are disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 35 to 41.
32 Transition to IFRS This is the first year that the Group and Company have presented financial statements under IFRS.
The following disclosures, including reconciliation between IFRS and UK GAAP upon implementation of the standards described below, are required in the year of conversion.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 December 2004 and the date of the transition to IFRS was therefore 1 January 2004.
The amounts described as UK GAAP have been reclassified to conform with IFRS format.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payments The Group operates a share option plan and a long term incentive plan under which equity-settled share-based awards are granted to employees.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, the Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 to all grants after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
Under these requirements, awards are measured at fair value at the date of grant and recognised on a straight-line basis over the performance period.
Fair value is measured using an option pricing model taking into consideration managements estimate of the expected life of the option and the estimated number of shares that will eventually vest.
Under UK GAAP, the intrinsic value of the awarded shares at grant date was recognised over the performance period.
The costs of the share schemes are either recognised in the income statement or capitalised according to the nature of the employee services.
IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources Under UK GAAP all costs incurred prior to obtaining a licence were capitalised to Intangible Assets.
These pre-licence costs are specifically excluded from IFRS 6 and as such general guidance under IFRS regarding asset recognition must be applied.
In most cases this will lead to such costs being expensed as incurred.
Prior to 1 January 2004 the Group had capitalised pre-licence costs of US$6,013,000.
Intangible Assets have therefore been reduced for these costs.
In the year to 31 December 2004 pre-licence costs of US$1,946,000 capitalised under UK GAAP were expensed.
Further, income of US$2,156,000 relating to the sale of OILSOC Investment Company Limited that was previously credited to Intangible Assets has been recorded as a gain on the disposal of this exploration venture.
The net effect is a credit to the Income Statement of US$210,000 in the year ended 31 December 2004.
These adjustments result in reclassification within the cash flow statement however there is no change to cash and cash equivalents.
Prior to 1 January 2004 the Group assessed Intangible Assets for impairment under UK GAAP with reference to the oil industry Statement of Recommended Practice SORP.
Under the SORP costs capitalised pending determination of whether or not commercial reserves have been found were specifically exempt from the detailed rules of Financial Reporting Standard 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill.
As such these costs were pooled with similar costs by geographical region.
Under IFRS, the Group has applied a lower level of aggregation of intangible assets for the purposes of assessing impairment in accordance with IFRS 6.
As a result the Group has reduced Intangible Assets by US$4,722,000 being costs incurred prior to 1 January 2004 on specific licences that were previously relinquished but remained capitalised under UK GAAP.
