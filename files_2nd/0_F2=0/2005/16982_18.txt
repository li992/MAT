On consolidation, the results of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period and their assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences, including those on monetary items that form part of a net investment in a foreign operation, are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve.
In the event that a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement is determined after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the operation.
As permitted by IFRS1, the Group elected to deem cumulative currency translation differences to be nil as at 27 December 2003.
Accordingly, the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation does not include currency translation differences arising before 27 December 2003.
In the cash ow statement, the cash ows of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benets will ow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue from sales of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of the goods, and can be reliably measured.
Revenue from the sales of services and revenue from construction contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion.
The stage of completion of a contract is determined either by reference to the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, or by reference to the completion of a physical proportion of the contract work, dependent upon the nature of the underlying contract.
A construction contract is dened as a contract that is specically negotiated for the construction of an asset or a combination of assets that are closely interrelated or interdependent in terms of their design, technology and function or their ultimate purpose or use.
Where the time taken to complete such contracts extends over different accounting periods, revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date where the outcome can be estimated reliably, otherwise it is recognised to the extent costs are incurred.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period when such losses become probable.
Goodwill Business combinations on or after 27 December 2003 are accounted for under IFRS3 using the purchase method.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents any excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Groups interest in the fair value of the entitys identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities determined at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill in respect of an acquired subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Where the fair value of the interest acquired in an entitys assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the consideration paid, the excess is recognised immediately as a gain in the income statement.
Goodwill recognised as an asset as at 27 December 2003 is recorded at its carrying amount at that date and is not amortised.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit.
Goodwill that was written-off directly to reserves under UK GAAP is not taken into account in determining the gain or loss on disposal of acquired businesses on or after 27 December 2003.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment losses.
a Acquired intangible assets An intangible resource acquired in a business combination is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected to generate future economic benets and its fair value can be measured reliably.
An acquired intangible asset with a nite life is amortised on a straight-line basis so as to charge its cost, which represents its fair value at the acquisition date, to the income statement over its expected useful life.
An acquired intangible asset with an indefinite life is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
The expected useful lives of the acquired intangible assets are as follows: Brand name - indefinite life Customer relationships - 25 years Favourable lease - 6 years b Research & development costs All research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred, unless it relates to the development of a new product and it is incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the product has been proven.
Any such capitalised development expenditure will be amortised on a straight-line basis so that it is charged to the income statement over the expected life of the resulting product.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2005 47 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued c Computer software Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset.
Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost of the software to the income statement over its expected useful life, not exceeding eight years.
Property, plant & equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land and assets under construction, is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost less residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, to the income statement over the expected useful life of the asset concerned, which is in the following ranges: Freehold buildings, long leasehold land & buildings - 10 to 40 years Short leasehold land & buildings - duration of lease Plant & equipment - 3 to 20 years Borrowing costs attributable to assets under construction are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Leases Leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classied as finance leases.
All other leases are classied as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant and equipment, initially measured at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments and a corresponding liability is recognised within obligations under finance leases.
Subsequently, the assets are depreciated on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or the lease term if shorter.
At the inception of the lease, the lease rentals are apportioned between an interest element and a capital element so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability.
Subsequently, the interest element is recognised as a charge to the income statement while the capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding liability.
Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Impairment of non-current assets All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values might be impaired.
Additionally, goodwill, intangible assets with an indefinite life and any capitalised development expenditure are subject to an annual impairment test.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that an assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
An assets value in use represents the present value of the future cash ows expected to be derived from the asset.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is conducted for the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
Similarly, the recoverable amount of goodwill is determined by reference to the discounted future cash ows of the cash-generating units to which it is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount.
The carrying amount of an asset shall not be increased above the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving items.
Cost represents the expenditure incurred in bringing inventories to their existing location and condition and comprises the cost of raw materials, direct labour costs, other direct costs and related production overheads.
Raw material cost is generally determined on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell.
Trade & other receivables Trade receivables, which generally are of a short dated nature, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
48 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2005 Cash & cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances.
Interest-bearing loans & borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the proceeds received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outow of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and where appropriate, the risks specic to the liability.
Derecognition of financial assets & liabilities Financial assets A financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash ows from the asset have expired: the Group retains the right to receive cash ows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash ows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modied, such an exchange or modication is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Financial instruments a Prospective adoption of IAS32 and IAS39 As permitted by IFRS1, the Group has elected to apply IAS32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement prospectively from 1 January 2005.
As a result, the relevant comparative information for the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2004 and as at 31 December 2004 does not reect the impact of these standards and is accounted for in accordance with UK GAAP.
b Investments Under UK GAAP, investments in UK gilts and United States treasury bonds are stated at cost.
From 1 January 2005 onwards, these investments will be classied as held to maturity assets or cash equivalents as appropriate and will be measured at amortised cost.
c Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Under UK GAAP, such derivative contracts are not recognised as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and gains or losses arising on them are not recognised until the hedged item is itself recognised in the financial statements.
From 1 January 2005 onwards, derivative financial instruments have been recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity proles.
Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by IAS39 are met.
Hedge accounting is applied in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under IAS39 and practical to do so.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships will be classied as fair value hedges, cash ow hedges or net investment hedges.
Where the hedging relationship is classied as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability will be adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss will be recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2005 49 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued Where the hedging relationship is classied as a cash ow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in equity rather than in the income statement.
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity will be either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
d Embedded derivatives Under UK GAAP, embedded derivatives are not recognised in the financial statements.
From 1 January 2005 onwards, derivatives embedded in nonderivative host contracts will be recognised separately as derivative financial instruments when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in the income statement.
Post-employment benets Post-employment benets comprise pension benets provided to employees throughout the world and other benets, primarily post retirement healthcare, provided to certain employees in the United States.
For dened benefit plans, the cost is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is recognised over the average expected remaining service lives of participating employees in accordance with the advice of qualied actuaries.
Past service costs resulting from enhanced benets are recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, or immediately if the benets have vested.
Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they occur.
The dened benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation, using a discount rate based on appropriate high quality corporate bonds, at the balance sheet date, minus any past service costs not yet recognised, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date.
Where a plan is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the amount of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
For dened contribution plans, the cost represents the Groups contributions to the plans and this is charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
Share-based payments Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Groups executive share option scheme, the savings-related share option scheme and the long-term incentive plan.
The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the awards.
For equity settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modied.
The fair value at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straightline basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions.
As permitted by IFRS1, the Group has applied IFRS2 Share-based Payment retrospectively only to equity settled awards that were granted on or after 7 November 2002 and had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
Taxation Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the period.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base with the following exceptions: deferred tax arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised.
deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
a deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unutilised tax losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised directly in equity.
50 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2005 Treasury shares The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company and the Group are classied in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
New standards & interpretations The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date for periods commencing after the date of these financial statements: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS Effective date for periods commencing IFRS1 Amendments to IFRS1 and IFRS6 1 January 2006 IFRS4 Amendments to IAS39 and IFRS4 Financial Guarantee Contracts 1 January 2006 IFRS6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources 1 January 2006 IFRS6 Amendments to IFRS1 and IFRS6 1 January 2006 IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS1 Amendment to IAS1 Capital Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS19 Amendment to IAS19 Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures 1 January 2006 IAS21 Amendment to IAS21 Net Investment in a Foreign Operation 1 January 2006 IAS39 Amendment to IAS39 The Fair Value Option 1 January 2006 IAS39 Amendment to IAS39 Cash Flow Hedge Accounting of Forecast Intragroup Transactions 1 January 2006 IAS39 Amendments to IAS39 and IFRS4 Financial Guarantee Contracts 1 January 2006 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease 1 January 2006 IFRIC5 Rights to Interests arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds 1 January 2006 IFRIC6 Liabilities arising from Participating in a Specic Market Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment 1 December 2005 IFRIC7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinationary Economies 1 March 2006 IFRIC8 Scope of IFRS2 1 May 2006 IFRIC9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives 1 June 2006 not yet adopted for use in the European Union With the exception of the IAS19 amendment Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures, which has been adopted early, the above standards and interpretations will be adopted in accordance with their effective dates.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Upon adoption of IFRS7, the Group will have to disclose additional information about its financial instruments, their signicance and the nature and extent of risks that they give rise to.
More specically, the Group will need to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure in greater detail.
There will be no effect on reported income or net assets.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2005 51 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 3.
Segment information The Group's primary reporting format is business segments, as the Group's risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by differences in the products and services provided.
The Groups secondary format is geographical segments.
The operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products and services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves different markets.
The Engineering Products segment comprises the manufacture of pumps and valves for ow control applications.
The Engineering Services segment provides equipment maintenance, process support and asset management services.
The Defence, Nuclear & Gas segment comprises the remaining defence and liquid gas handling businesses which were previously included in the Techna Division and which provide specialist design and project management of complex engineering contracts.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The Group's geographical segments are determined by the location of the Group's assets and operations.
Business segments The following tables present revenue and profit information and certain asset and liability information regarding the Groups business segments for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2005 and 53 weeks ended 31 December 2004.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2005 53 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 3.
Segment information continued Geographical segments The following tables present revenue, expenditure and certain asset information regarding the Group's geographical segments for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2005 and the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2004.
Unallocated liabilities primarily comprise interest-bearing loans and borrowings, income tax payable, retirement benefit obligations and deferred tax liabilities as well as liabilities relating to general head ofce activities.
The difference between unallocated assets in the business and geographical segments arises as a result of different inter segment eliminations.

Restructuring costs 2005 2004 000 000 Reorganisation costs 21,417 - Impairment of property, plant & equipment 1,433 - Impairment of inventories 1,846 - 24,696 - During the year, the Group incurred a loss of 24,696,000 in connection with the previously announced fundamental restructuring activities in the UK Engineering Products businesses.
The impairment loss on property, plant and equipment arose as a result of the relocation of the Hudderseld business to new premises during the year, at which point some property, plant and equipment was identied as being impared and written down to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount comprises fair value less costs to sell based upon expected market values.
The impairment loss recognised in respect of the write off of inventories arose as a result of the decision to restructure the product portfolios in each of the businesses concerned and to exit certain product lines, the final determination of which occurred in 2005.
The remaining reorganisation costs were primarily employee related costs and legal and professional fees.
These costs arose from activities that are not considered to be operating in nature and accordingly have been disclosed separately as to include them in operating activities would impair the comparability of the financial statements.
Other non fundamental restructuring activities throughout the Group are included in operating activities.

These assets will be recovered when future tax charges are sufficient to absorb these tax benets.
Deferred tax asset balances for capital losses in the UK amounting to 18,855,000 2004: 13,593,000 have not been recognised but would be available in the event of future capital gains being incurred by the Group.
d Temporary differences associated with Group investments At 30 December 2005, there was no recognised deferred tax liability 2004: nil for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain of the Group's subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates as the Group does not foresee a distribution of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates which would result in a reversal of deferred tax.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to 214,205,000 2004: 201,899,000.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.
58 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2005 8.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year adjusted for the effects of dilutive options.

Impairment testing of goodwill & intangible assets with indefinite lives Goodwill acquired through business combinations and intangible assets with indefinite lives have been allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as per the table below.
The amount allocated to Other is not considered significant in comparison to the total carrying amount of goodwill.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations using cash ow forecasts based on the latest strategic five year plan projections approved by the Board.
These projections are based on historical performance and the most recent financial forecasts available.
The main assumptions relate to selling price, sales volumes and cost increases.
Cash ows beyond the period of the projections are extrapolated based on expected growth rates for the geographical area.
The growth rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rates for these areas.
A growth rate of 3% 2004: 2.5% is used for all CGUs with the exception of the Warman companies which used a weighted average growth rate of 3.1% 2004: 2.5%.
The discount rates applied to the cash ow forecasts are based on the weighted average, nominal, risk adjusted pre-tax cost of capital in the various geographical regions.
The weighted average discount rates used were 14.3% 2004: 14.1% for Warman companies, 14% for Weir Gabbioneta and 13.8% 2004: 13.9% for Other.

Business combinations On 30 September 2005, the Company acquired 100% of the share capital of Pompe Gabbioneta SpA, an unlisted company based in Milan, Italy specialising in the manufacture and sale of petrochemical pumps.
The total cash consideration was 69,172,000.
The aquisition has been accounted for on a provisional basis until the final determination of fair values has been completed.
The provisional fair values of the identiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition are: Recognised on acquisition Carrying values 000 000 Property, plant & equipment 4,123 4,123 Intangible assets 20,545 162 Inventories 5,790 5,790 Trade & other receivables 7,753 7,753 Cash & cash equivalents 303 303 Interest-bearing loans & borrowings 259 259 Trade & other payables 7,856 7,856 Forward foreign currency contracts 226 226 Provisions for liabilities & charges 5,447 5,447 Income tax 441 441 Deferred tax 3,625 4,019 Fair value of net assets 20,054 7,315 Goodwill arising on acquisition 49,118 Total consideration 69,172 Consideration 68,064 Costs associated with the acquisition 1,108 Total consideration 69,172 The cash outow on acquisition is as follows: Cash & cash equivalents acquired 303 Cash paid 68,792 Net cash outow 69,095 From the date of the acquisition, Pompe Gabbioneta now called Weir Gabbioneta, has contributed 400,000 to the profit from continuing operations of the Group.
The directors consider that it is impractical to disclose the combined revenue and profit of the Group, assuming that Weir Gabbioneta had been acquired at the start of the year, due to the fact that their financial statements were previously prepared under local GAAP accounting policies.
The acquisition of Weir Gabbioneta offers many benets and opportunities including a strengthening of the Group's relationships with many of the world's major oil producers through increased sales volumes and broader product offerings, the opportunity to extend Weir Gabbioneta's markets in the United States and Asia, using the Weir name and geographic footprint, and Weir Gabbioneta's existing installed base, and, the opportunity to obtain further benets from the Group's recent investments in purchasing, manufacturing technologies and systems.
Intangible assets have been recognised in respect of the Gabbioneta brand name, customer contracts and related relationships and a favourable property lease.
Other intangible assets, such as an assembled workforce, have not been recognised separately from goodwill.

Equity settled share-based payments L-TIP Awards of performance shares, matching shares and investment shares may be made under the L-TIP to senior executives.
I Performance shares Performance shares are conditional awards to acquire free shares subject to company performance.
In 2005, conditional awards of performance shares were made worth 70% of salary to the chief executive, 45% of salary to other executive directors, 40% of salary to senior executives and 25% to other participants.
It is the Remuneration Committee's intention in 2006 to make awards of the same value.
II Matching and investment shares The chief executive, other executive directors and senior executives are required to compulsorily convert an element of any Group element of bonus earned for the preceding financial year structured as an award of investment shares under the L-TIP.
They are also allowed to voluntarily invest the balance of the Group element of bonus subject to any cap imposed by the Remuneration Committee, currently 10% in shares.
In return, they receive a conditional award of matching shares worth a maximum of 2.5 times the pre-tax value of the bonus invested.
Matching shares are conditional awards to acquire free shares, subject to company performance.
The value of shares for this purpose will be the average published closing price of a share for the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant of the award of shares.
The conditional awards of performance shares and matching shares only vest if a highly demanding performance condition is achieved.
"For awards granted in 2004 and 2005, the performance condition is based on the growth in the Company's Total Shareholder Return ""TSR"" over a single three year performance period three consecutive financial years beginning with the year in which the grant is made relative to the growth in the TSR of a comparator group, to comprise the following 20 companies: AGA Foodservice Group, Bodycote International, Cookson Group, Domnick Hunter Group, Enodis, FKI, Halma, IMI, Kidde, Meggitt, Mitie Group, Morgan Crucible Company, Rolls-Royce, Rotork, Senior, Smiths Group, Spirax-Sarco Engineering, Tomkins, Wood Group and WS Atkins."
For awards granted in 2006, the comparator group will comprise the same companies save that, as Kidde and Domnick Hunter are now no longer listed on the London Stock Exchange, the Remuneration Committee are looking to substitute other companies.
Only if the company's TSR ranks in the upper quintile of this group will the full awards vest.
This reduces on a sliding scale so that for median performance, 25% of the awards will vest.
For below median performance, none of the awards will vest.
In addition to TSR performance, for any of the performance and matching shares to vest, the growth in the Company's earnings per share over the performance period must be equal to or greater than the growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period.
During the year, conditional awards of 860,788 shares 2004: 850,970 shares were made to participants under the L-TIP making a total of 1,711,758 awards at 30 December 2005.
The market price at the date of the award was 322p 2004: 307p.
The awards vest over a three year period.
An amount of 991,000 2004: 356,000 has been charged to the income statement in respect of the number of awards which are expected to be made at the end of the vesting period.
"Share option schemes The Company operated a discretionary executive share option scheme ""the Executive Scheme"" under which options could be granted to those senior executives of the Group whose skills and experience the Remuneration Committee believed to be important to the success of the Group."
The Executive Scheme, which was approved in 1994, expired in May 2004.
Under the rules of the Executive Scheme, share options could be granted up to a maximum value of four times a participant's earnings.
Options were granted at the mid market price of the share at the date of grant.
The right to exercise an Executive Scheme option is subject to performance conditions as determined by the Committee at the date of grant.
The peformance criteria applicable were for the growth in the Company's normalised earnings per share over a three year period, to either exceed by nine percent the growth in the retail price index of the UK over that three year period, or exceed the weighted average growth during that three year period of the normalised earnings per share of those companies in the FTSE All Share Engineering and Machinery sector.
Under the terms of the Scheme, this is re-tested every year from the third anniversary of the grant of the option to the date the option lapses.
In addition, the Company operated a Savings-related Share Option Scheme in the UK which was not subject to performance criteria.
This scheme was closed in 2004.

These options have not been subsequently modied and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS2.
Equity settled share-based payments continued Fair value of equity settled share-based payments The fair value of the conditional awards under the L-TIP has been estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model and the fair value of options granted under the Executive Scheme has been estimated using the Black-Scholes model.

Pensions and other post-employment benefit plans The Group has six dened benefit pension plans in the UK and North America, the most significant being the two UK plans.
All dened benefit plans are closed to new members.
For these closed plans, the current service cost is expected to increase under the projected unit method as the members of the plan approach retirement.
The Group also provides certain additional post-retirement healthcare benets to senior employees in the United States.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension plan deficits are attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension plans.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised on an IFRS basis in the Group statement of recognised income and expense before 27 December 2003.
Write downs of inventory occur regularly in the general course of business and the amounts are considered to be insignicant.
These are included in cost of sales in the income statement.

It is expected that all costs related to such claims will have been incurred within five years of the balance sheet date.
Onerous sales contracts Provision has been made in respect of sales contracts entered into for the sale of goods in the normal course of business where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benets expected to be received from the contracts.
Provision is made immediately when it becomes apparent that expected costs will exceed the expected benets of the contract.
It is expected that the costs will be incurred within one year of the balance sheet date.
Discontinued operations warranty and indemnity During the year, the Company provided in full for residual liabilities of discontinued operations for which the Company retains responsibility.
The provision is based on management's current best estimate.
The actual outcome may differ, and in some cases, this will be dependent on the outcome of legal proceedings.
It is expected that the majority of these costs will be incurred within one year with the remaining costs expected to be incurred within five years of the balance sheet date.
Rationalisation Rationalisation provisions relate primarily to the remaining costs to be expensed under the restructuring activities of our UK Engineering Products businesses as described in note 5.
It is expected that the majority of this provision will be utilised in 2006 with remaining lease obligations costs being incurred in the period up to 2010.
Deferred consideration Deferred consideration relates to the final earn out payment on a previous year's acquisition.
It is expected that this cost will be incurred in 2006.
Other Other provisions relate principally to an environmental clean up programme in the United States, for a company acquired in 1992 and employment related provisions in the UK, Australia, South America and Europe.
The environmental provision is based on management's current best estimate of the expected costs under the programme.
It is expected that these costs will be incurred in the period up to 2019.
The employment related provisions arise from legal obligations in various countries where full provision is made based on the number of employees in the companies.

Terms & conditions of transactions with related parties Sales to and from related parties are made at normal market prices.
Outstanding balances at the year end are unsecured and settlement occurs in cash.
There have been no guarantees provided or received for any related party balances.
For the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2005, the Group has not raised any provision for doubtful debts relating to amounts owed by related parties as the payment history has been excellent 2004: nil.
This assessment is undertaken each financial year through examining the financial position of the related party and the market in which the related party operates.
Compensation of key management personnel Key management comprises the Board of directors.
Further details of their remuneration can be found in the Remuneration Committee Report on page 31.
Financial risk management objectives & policies The Group's principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term debt, loans, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Group's funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group has other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those relating to foreign currency, commodity price, credit, liquidity and interest rate.
These risks are managed in accordance with Board approved policies.
Foreign currency risk The Group has invested in operations outside the United Kingdom and also buys and sells goods and services in currencies other than in the functional currency of its subsidiary operations.
As a result, the Group's non sterling revenues, profits, assets, liabilities and cash ows can be affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Group seeks to minimise its transaction exposure by maintaining a policy that all operating units hedge using forward foreign currency contracts to eliminate exposures on committed transactions over the currency equivalent of 100,000.
In addition, it is Group policy that the three companies where the most significant concentration of foreign currency risk has been identied also apply hedge accounting.
It is Group policy not to engage in any speculative transaction of any kind.
Commodity price risk The Group's exposure to raw material price risk is generally diminished by restricting bid validity to periods within those quoted by suppliers and by material price escalation clauses.
Credit risk The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group's credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and amounts due under construction contracts.
The Group is exposed to risk over a large number of countries and customers and there is no significant concentration of risk.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risk by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
Credit worthiness checks are also undertaken before entering into contracts with new customers and credit limits are set as appropriate.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identiable loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash ows.
Liquidity risk The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and exibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans and finance leases.
Interest rate risk The majority of the Group's borrowings are at variable rates of interest.
Interest rate risk is regularly monitored to ensure that the mix of variable and xed rate borrowing is appropriate for the Group in the short to medium term.
Based on current levels of net debt, interest rate risk is not considered to be material.
The associated cash ow risk, which can have a positive impact on the Group if interest rates decrease as well as a negative impact if interest rates increase, is also not considered to be material.

Financial instruments Fair values Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the Group's financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements.
The comparative information for 2004 is provided on the basis of the disclosures provided under UK GAAP in the Group's 2004 annual report and accounts.
"As detailed in note 32, the Group has elected to apply IAS32 ""Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation"" and IAS39 ""Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement"" prospectively from 1 January 2005 and, as permitted by IFRS1, comparative information has not been restated."

The fair value of all other items has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash ows at prevailing interest rates.
The carrying amount of the other financial instruments of the Group, ie.
short term trade receivables and payables that are not included in the above table, is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
The carrying amount recorded in the balance sheet of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Interest rate risk The following tables set out the carrying amount, by maturity, of the Group's financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk.

The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.

Cash ow hedges At 30 December 2005, the Group held over 600 forward foreign currency contracts designated as hedges of expected future sales or purchases for which the Group has rm commitments.
The forward foreign currency contracts are being used to eliminate the material currency risk of the rm commitments.
The terms of the contracts are negotiated to match the terms of the commitments.
Any gains and losses on ineffective hedges were taken to the income statement in the year.
Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards For all periods up to and including the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2004, the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice UK GAAP.
These financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2005 are the first the Group is required to prepare in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The first results prepared on an IFRS basis were contained in the Groups unaudited results announcement for the 26 weeks ended 1 July 2005.
The Group has prepared financial statements which comply with IFRS applicable for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and the significant accounting policies meeting those requirements are outlined in note 2.
In preparing these financial statements the Group has started from an opening balance sheet as at 27 December 2003, the Groups date of transition to IFRS and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements as required by IFRS1 for the first time adoption of IFRS.
The Group issued a press release on 1 July 2005 which contained the restatement of its UK GAAP balance sheet as at 27 December 2003 and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2004.
This note summarises the principal adjustments made by the Group in that restatement.
The adjustments are categorised into either reclassications or remeasurements.
The format of the balance sheet included in these financial statements differs from the initial press release and the interim report as the directors are of the opinion that the revised format is more appropriate for a UK listed plc.
The format of the income statement included in these financial statements has been updated since the initial press release to reect the impact of discontinued operations.
The transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has no effect on the cash ows generated by the Group.
The IFRS cash ow statement is presented in a different format from that required under UK GAAP with cash ows split into three categories of activities - operating, investing and nancing.
The reconciling items between the UK GAAP presentation and the IFRS presentation have no net impact on the cash ows generated.
In preparing the cash ow statement under IFRS, cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
Under UK GAAP, short-term highly liquid investments were not classied as cash equivalents.
Exemptions applied IFRS1 First time adoption of IFRS allows first time adopters certain exemptions from the general requirement to apply IFRS effective as at 30 December 2005 retrospectively.
The Group has taken the following exemptions: Business combinations The Group has elected not to apply IFRS3 Business Combinations to business combinations that took place before 27 December 2003.
Share-based payments The Group has applied IFRS2 Share-based Payment retrospectively only to equity settled awards that were granted on or after 7 November 2002 and had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
Financial instruments The Group has elected to apply IAS32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement prospectively from 1 January 2005.
Consequently, the relevant comparative information for 2004 does not reect the impact of these standards and is accounted for on a UK GAAP basis.
Cumulative foreign currency translation differences The Group has elected to deem the cumulative differences on the retranslation into sterling of the Groups net investment in foreign operations to be nil as at 27 December 2003.
Post-employment benets All cumulative actuarial gains and losses on Group dened benefit pension schemes have been recognised in reserves as at the transition date.
Property, plant & equipment The Group has elected to use previous UK GAAP revaluations of property, plant and equipment prior to 27 December 2003 as deemed cost at the date of the revaluation.
Accounting policies applied in the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2004 As noted above, the Group has elected to apply IAS32 and IAS39 prospectively from 1 January 2005 and, as permitted by IFRS1, the comparative information for 2004 has not been restated.
The new accounting policy in respect of financial instruments is included in note 2.
For accounting periods up to the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2004, derivative contracts were not recognised as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and gains or losses arising on them were not recognised until the hedged item had itself been recognised in the financial statements.
Transactions covered by forward foreign currency contracts were recorded at the forward contract rate and monetary assets and liabilities in respect of the hedged transaction were translated at the forward contract rate.

Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards continued Nature of the main adjustments to comply with IAS32 and IAS39 Had IAS32 and IAS39 been applied from 27 December 2003 the following adjustments would have been necessary in the financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2004: Derivative contracts would have been recognised as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet measured at their fair values.
Changes in their fair values would have been recognised in the income statement unless hedge accounting was applied.
The following table shows the impact of adopting IAS32 and IAS39 prospectively from 1 January 2005 on the Groups equity, net funds, tax and other assets liabilities.
Other assets liabilities Tax Net funds Equity 000 000 000 000 As at 31 December 2004 232,123 20,584 12,600 265,307 Adoption of IAS32 & IAS39 3,707 1,049 219 2,439 As at 1 January 2005 235,830 19,535 12,381 267,746 Summary of the transition adjustments a Property, plant & equipment Under UK GAAP, all capitalised computer software was included within tangible xed assets.
Under IAS38 Intangible Assets, capitalised computer software must be presented as an intangible asset unless it is integral to an item of property, plant and equipment.
Under IFRS, non-integral computer software with a carrying value of 3,700,000 has been reclassied from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets at 31 December 2004 3,008,000 at 27 December 2003.
In addition, government grants of 17,000 at 31 December 2004 26,000 at 27 December 2003 have been netted against property, plant and equipment as permitted by IFRS.
b Intangible assets In addition to the reclassication of computer software noted above there are differences in respect of goodwill.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill was amortised over its useful economic life, tested for impairment and provided against as necessary.
Under IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but must be tested for impairment as at 27 December 2003 the transition date and at least annually thereafter.
The impairment tests carried out by the Group as at 27 December 2003 and 31 December 2004 revealed no impairment loss.
Goodwill amortisation, excluding the Groups share of associates, charged under UK GAAP during 2004 was 7,163,000 and this amount is credited back to the income statement under IFRS.
The impact on the balance sheet, after adjusting for exchange differences is 7,091,000. c Investments Under IAS28 Investments in Associates, the application of the equity method requires that the investees financial statements be prepared using accounting policies which conform to those of the investor.
The adoption of IFRS by the Group results in a net 15,295,000 reduction in investments in associates as at 31 December 2004 10,428,000 at 27 December 2003 due to adjustments in respect of goodwill, intangible assets, pensions and tax.
This alignment to IFRS also results in a reduction of 408,000 to the Groups share of associates profits after tax for 2004.
The income statement has been reformatted to remove the Groups share of revenue of joint ventures and associates in accordance with IFRS.
In addition, the results after interest and tax of joint ventures and associates are shown as single line items respectively in arriving at profit from operations.
Associates results for 2004 were presented under UK GAAP as 9,157,000 profit, 219,000 interest charge and 2,636,000 tax charge.
Under IFRS, the contribution from associates to the Groups profit from operations is presented as 6,302,000 profit prior to any adjustment for the changes referred to above.
Joint ventures results for 2004 were presented under UK GAAP as 536,000 profit, 26,000 interest income and 21,000 tax charge.
Under IFRS, the contribution from joint ventures to the Groups profit from operations is presented as 541,000 profit prior to the adjustment in respect of discontinued operations.
The balance sheet has been reformatted to show a single line amount representing investments in joint ventures and associates.
Other investments of 213,000 at 31 December 2004 445,000 at 27 December 2003 were reclassied as current asset investments.
d Deferred tax Under UK GAAP, deferred tax is netted off against the related pension liability but under IFRS deferred tax on the pension liability is included within the deferred tax balance.
In addition, deferred tax assets of 2,775,000 at 31 December 2004 2,183,000 at 27 December 2003 and liabilities of 17,418,000 at 31 December 2004 17,533,000 at 27 December 2003 previously included in trade and other receivables and provisions for liabilities and charges respectively have been reclassied and shown separately on the face of the balance sheet.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2005 85 Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 32.
Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards continued Under UK GAAP, deferred tax was provided on timing differences between the accounting and taxable profit an income statement approach.
Under IAS12 Income Taxes, deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the book carrying value and tax base of assets and liabilities a balance sheet approach.
Under IFRS, the difference in approach means that deferred tax provisions of 9,193,000 relating to goodwill written off against reserves under UK GAAP and not reinstated under IFRS are written back as at 31 December 2004 10,135,000 at 27 December 2003.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised because it did not meet the IAS12 recognition criteria.
This resulted in an adjustment of 982,000 in respect of exchange translation recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve.
An additional tax credit of 40,000 was recognised in the income statement in respect of other deferred tax adjustments identied during the transition to IFRS.
The above resulted in an adjustment to the balance sheet offset of 7,598,000 at 31 December 2004 7,290,000 at 27 December 2003. e Construction contracts IAS11 Construction Contracts requires balance sheet classications which differ from UK GAAP.
As a result, at 31 December 2004, inventory of 5,160,000, trade and other receivables of 36,042,000, trade and other payables of 24,920,000 and provisions for liabilities and charges of 213,000 have been reclassied as construction contract assets of 45,905,000 and construction contract liabilities of 29,836,000.
At 27 December 2003, inventory of 4,295,000, trade and other receivables of 22,257,000, trade and other payables of 10,981,000 and provisions for liabilities and charges of 231,000 have been reclassied as construction contract assets of 29,465,000 and construction contract liabilities of 14,125,000.
In addition, penalties on construction contracts should be deducted from revenue resulting in a 688,000 reduction to revenue and corresponding reduction in cost of sales.
f Income tax IFRS requires separate disclosure of tax balances on the face of the balance sheet.
As a result, income tax receivable of 1,589,000 at 31 December 2004 2,658,000 at 27 December 2003 and income tax payable of 5,123,000 at 31 December 2004 8,177,000 at 27 December 2003 have been reclassied from trade and other receivables and trade and other payables respectively.
An adjustment to income tax payable of 89,000 at 31 December 2004 and at 27 December 2003 arose as a result of minor differences identied during the transition to IFRS.
g Cash & cash equivalents Certain investments with an original maturity of less than three months amounting to 335,000 at 31 December 2004 nil at 27 December 2003 have been reclassied from other investments to cash and cash equivalents in accordance with IFRS.
h Interest-bearing loans & borrowings Current obligations under finance leases amounting to 475,000 at 31 December 2004 517,000 at 27 December 2003 have been reclassied from trade and other payables to interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
Similarly, non current obligations under finance leases have been reclassied.
i Trade & other payables Proposed dividends Under UK GAAP, proposed dividends were recognised as a liability in the period to which they related.
Under IFRS, dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared.
Net assets at 31 December 2004 increase by 19,362,000, representing the reversal of the accrual for the final ordinary dividend proposed in respect of 2004 18,525,000 as at 27 December 2003.
Holiday pay IAS19 explicitly requires appropriate accrual to be made for the cost of all holiday entitlements not taken at the balance sheet date.
This is more prescriptive than was the case under UK GAAP.
Therefore holiday pay accruals amounting to 410,000 and a related deferred tax asset of 123,000 have been incorporated as at 31 December 2004 466,000 and 140,000 respectively as at 27 December 2003.
As a result of this change, the cost of providing employee benets recognised during 2004 decreased by 56,000 along with a corresponding tax charge of 17,000. j Provisions for liabilities & charges Provisions for liabilities and charges expected to fall due within one year amounting to 11,418,000 at 31 December 2004 8,369,000 at 27 December 2003 have been shown separately on the face of the balance sheet.
k Retirement benefit obligations Under UK GAAP, post employment benets were accounted for under FRS17 Retirement Benets, whereby operating costs of providing retirement benets are recognised in the periods the benets are earned by employees and finance costs are recognised in the periods they arise.
Under FRS17, actuarial gains and losses are reected in the statement of total recognised gains and losses in the period in which they arise.
86 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2005 32.
Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards continued Under IAS19 Employee Benets, the fair value of assets is required to be based on a bid market price whereas under FRS17 the mid market price was used.
The value of dened benefit pension scheme assets have therefore been reduced by 975,000 with a deferred tax impact of 293,000 and 1,221,000 with a deferred tax impact of 366,000 as at 27 December 2003 and 31 December 2004 respectively and the net finance income recognised during 2004 decreased by 68,000 with a corresponding tax credit of 20,000.
Under IAS19, a number of options for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses are permitted.
The Groups policy is to recognise immediately any variations in full, as opposed to applying the corridor approach, in a statement of recognised income and expense, as permitted in the IASBs amendment to IAS19 entitled Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures.
l Minority interest Under IFRS, minority interest is disclosed as part of total equity.
Therefore, minority interest of 573,000 at 31 December 2004 567,000 at 27 December 2003 has been reclassied.
m Foreign currency translation differences Exchange differences amounting to 2,805,000 on the retranslation into sterling of the Groups net investment in foreign operations for the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2004 have been reclassied to a separate component of equity in accordance with IAS21.
The impact of the transition to IFRS was to increase this by 1,206,000.
Under UK GAAP, exchange differences that arise on translating a monetary item which forms part of the reporting entitys net investment in a foreign operation and which is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of either the reporting entity or the foreign operation are recorded as movements on reserves.
Under IFRS, such exchange differences require to be reported in the income statement.
As a result of this change, an exchange gain of 203,000 reported as a movement in reserves is now recognised in the income statement along with a corresponding tax charge of 51,000 for the period ending 31 December 2004. n Share-based payments Under UK GAAP, the cost of awards made under the Groups employee share schemes was based on the intrinsic value of the awards, with the exception of the SAYE scheme for which no cost was recognised.
Under IFRS2 Share-based Payment, the cost of employee share schemes, including SAYE schemes, is based on the fair value of the awards that must be assessed using an option-pricing model.
Generally, the fair value of the award is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy either service conditions or non-market performance conditions, such as EPS growth targets.
As a result of these changes, the cost of employee share schemes recognised during 2004 has decreased by 244,000 with a corresponding tax charge of 48,000. o Finance costs Under IFRS, finance costs should be shown separately on the face of the income statement.
As a result, finance revenue of 2,379,000 has been removed from net finance costs and shown separately on the face of the income statement.
p Loss from discontinued operations Under IFRS5, the loss from discontinued operations must be separately disclosed as a single line on the face of the income statement.
The analysis of the loss from discontinued operations is included in note 8.
