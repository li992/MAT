UK law prescribes that only reserves of the company are taken into account for the purpose of making distributions and the permissible applications of the share premium account.
The merger reserve arose on the acquisition of NatWest under UK GAAP accounting.
The Group optimises capital efficiency by maintaining reserves in subsidiaries, including regulated entities.
Certain preference shares and subordinated debt are also included within regulatory capital.
The remittance of reserves to the parent or the redemption of shares or subordinated capital by regulated entities may be subject to maintaining the capital resources required by the relevant regulator.
