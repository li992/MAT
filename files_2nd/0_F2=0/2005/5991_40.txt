The major schemes, which cover the majority of scheme members, are of the dened benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
All the dened benefit schemes are now closed to new entrants, with new pension arrangements made by way of the group Personal Pension scheme which is of the dened contribution type.
The group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP24, and the disclosures given in a are those required by that standard.
FRS17 Retirement Benets was issued in November 2000 but is not yet mandatory for the group.
The transitional disclosures, to the extent not given in a are set out in b below.
The disclosures below indicate that differences exist between the valuation of the pension schemes assets and liabilities under SSAP24 and FRS17.
These differences arise since SSAP24 and FRS17 use different valuation bases.
a Findel pension schemes The principal UK scheme the Findel Group Pension Scheme was assessed by Aon Consulting, the schemes actuaries, at 6 April 2004 using the projected unit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in that valuation were that the annual rate of return on investments would be between 0.25% and 1.50% higher than the annual increase in total pensionable remuneration and between 2.25% and 3.50% higher than the annual increase in present and future pensions in payment.
The actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 83% of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable remuneration.
The market value of the schemes assets at the date of valuation was 44.8m.
The next valuation is due in April 2007.
A further two UK dened benefit schemes the Novara Dened benefit Schemes were acquired with the acquisition of Novara plc.
These schemes were assessed by Aon Consulting, the schemes actuaries, at 6 April 2004.
The principal of these schemes, accounting for 84% of the combined assets and 85% of the combined liabilities of the schemes, was assessed using the Attained Age method.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in that valuation were that the annual rate of return on investments would be between 0.50% and 3% higher than the annual increase in total pensionable remuneration and between 2% and 4.5% higher than the annual increase in present and future pensions in payment.
The actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 71% of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable remuneration.
The market value of the schemes assets at the date of valuation was 11.4m.
The net pension cost for the purposes of SSAP24 has been assessed by Aon Consulting on the assumptions that, over the longer term, the annual rate of return on investments would be between 0.5% to 3% higher than the annual increase in total pensionable remuneration and between 2.25% and 4.5% higher than the annual increase in present and future pensions in payment.
The deficit as calculated is being spread over the average remaining service lives of current employees.
The net pension cost, including expenses, for the group was 2.67m 2004: 1.43m and there is a pension prepayment in the balance sheet of 7.83m 2004: 6.72m.
