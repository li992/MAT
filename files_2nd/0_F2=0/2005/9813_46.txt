The fair value of the shares issued, based on market price at the date of acquisition, was recorded as the consideration.
The 1.2m nominal value of the shares issued has been recognised in share capital and the difference between nominal and fair value of 41.5m has been recorded as a merger reserve in the Group accounts.
In the Companys accounts the cost of investment in Burtonwood of 92.5m see note 13 reflects 1.2m nominal value of shares issued, cash of 84.3m and loan notes of 7.0m.
The attributed fair values are provisional.
Any further adjustments will be included in next year's financial statements.
The revaluation adjustment reflects the valuation of the acquired estate as at 6 January 2005.
The valuation was carried out by independent chartered surveyors Gillman Jones on an existing use basis.
No deferred tax has been recognised on the revaluation adjustment as there are no agreements to sell the assets concerned.
The other fair value adjustments include the valuation of the Burtonwood pension scheme and the market value of debentures at acquisition date.
Deferred tax has been recognised on these fair value adjustments.

For the period from 4 April 2004 to 5 January 2005, Burtonwood recorded turnover of 40.1m, operating profit of 9.1m, profit before taxation of 3.0m and profit after taxation of 0.5m.
There is no difference between profit after taxation and the recognised gains and losses for that period.
Since acquisition, the cash operations of Burtonwood have been integrated into the existing Group accounts.
As a result, it is impractical to isolate the cash flows of Burtonwood.
