EMPLOYEES continued The Group operates throughout the UK a defined benefit final salary pension scheme, the assets of which are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The pension cost has been assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit method in a review of the Scheme as at 1st December 2001.
The actuarial assumptions are that the investment return will be 1.9% per annum above annual salary growth.
The market value of the assets of the Scheme on 1st December 2001 was 75.9m.
Their actuarial value, using the new assumptions, represented 72% of the value of benefits for service to the date of the review allowing for future salary increases.
In deriving a pension cost, the shortfall in the Scheme is being spread as fixed amounts over the future working lifetime of the existing members.
For the purpose of funding the Scheme, the shortfall is spread over a shorter period as a level percentage of members salaries.
As a result of the actuarial valuation at 1st December 2001 employer contributions to the Scheme increased with effect from 1st December 2002.
In this regard, with effect from 1st December 2002, the Companys UK employer contribution was increased to 15.2% of pensionable salary.
The Group has also agreed to strengthen the Schemes funding by additional contributions of 2.1m per annum for 10 years, from 2003.
The actual additional contribution made in each year will be reviewed annually in light of the actuarial advice.
Furthermore, with effect from 1st December 2003 the employer contribution was increased to 18.2% of pensionable salary.
The defined benefit final salary section of the pension scheme closed to new members on 1st July 2001 and was replaced by defined contribution section of the Scheme for new employees.
Under the projected unit method of valuation, the current service cost will increase as members approach retirement.
The total UK employer contribution in respect of both Schemes for the year ended 30th June 2005 amounted to 10.4m 2004 9.2m, while the amount charged to the profit and loss account was 8.8m 2004 8.6m.
This reduced the balance sheet accrual of 5.4m at the year ended 30th June 2004 to 3.8m at 30th June 2005.
EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the profit after taxation of 290,700,000 2004 260,500,000 and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue and ranking for dividend during the year excluding those held by the Barratt Developments Employee Benefit Trust of 235,167,051 2004 233,904,273.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue and ranking for dividend is adjusted to assume the conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
The effect of the dilutive potential shares is 2,962,205 2004 2,597,644, this gives a diluted weighted average number of shares of 238,129,256 2004 236,501,917.
