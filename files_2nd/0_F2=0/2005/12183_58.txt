Our industry 6 A 10 billion global industry at primary MARKET AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT manufacturing level The global market for flat glass in calendar year 2004 was approximately 36 million tonnes.
Pilkington float process is at the heart At the level of primary manufacture this represents a value of around 10 billion.
Of this tonnage, of the worldwide industry around 70 per cent is consumed in windows for buildings, ten per cent in glazing products for 75% of the worlds demand for glass is automotive applications and 20 per cent used in furniture and other interior applications.
in Europe, China and North America Europe, China and North America together account for 75 per cent of demand for glass.
Europe Pilkington is one of four glass groups is the most mature glass market and has the highest proportion of value-added products.
producing 62% of the worlds high Just four companies: Pilkington, Asahi, Saint-Gobain and Guardian, produce 62 per cent of the quality glass worlds high quality float glass.
Much of the worlds lower quality float and sheet glass production Pilkington is one of only three glass groups is being replaced by high quality float.
supplying 75% of the worlds automotive There are only three glass groups with global automotive glazing capability and presence.
Pilkington, OE glazing Asahi and Saint-Gobain, together with their respective associates and strategic partners, supply 75 per cent of the worlds Original Equipment OE glazing requirements.

Global demand for glass outstrips economic growth around the world.
Todays architects and car designers are using larger surface areas of glass in their designs, increasingly with added functionality and complexity.
7 GLOBAL GLASS GROWTH vs. REAL GDP GROWTH GROWTH IN GLASS Over the past 20 years, glass demand has grown more quickly than GDP.
Global glass demand growth: 3.9% p. a.
150 Over the long-term, glass demand is still growing at around 3.9 per cent per annum.
Demand growth for glass is driven not only by economic growth, 100 Real GDP growth: 2.6% p. a. but also by legislation and regulations concerning safety, noise attenuation and the response to the growing need for energy conservation.
Architects 50 and car designers are using increasingly more glass in buildings and vehicles.
