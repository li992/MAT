The 2004 prior period adjustment relates to the settlement of a number of tax issues covering several accounting periods including merger costs, divestment provisions and fixed asset valuations.
Deferred tax income statement amounts arise principally in respect of the origination and reversal of temporary differences.
To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided for.
No deferred tax has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as these are, in the main, considered permanently employed in the businesses of these companies and, in the case of joint ventures and associates, the taxes would not be material.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and or UK taxation after allowing for double taxation relief if they were to be distributed as dividends.
