PENSIONS During the year the transitional provisions of Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits FRS 17 continue to be in force.
This standard will require assets or liabilities arising from defined benefit pension schemes to be evaluated and accounted for in companies primary financial statements on a new basis.
As a transitional measure, the standard requires that information relating to the pension asset or liability calculated on the new basis is disclosed by way of memorandum in the notes to the accounts.
These disclosures are given at a below.
The Standard provides that the asset or liability recognised in the accounts at 30 September 2005 should continue to be calculated according to Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs SSAP 24.
Disclosures relating to this calculation are given at b below.
Disclosures in respect of defined contribution pension schemes under both standards are given at c below.
The pension scheme asset calculated in accordance with SSAP 24 and recognised in the balance sheet of the Group at 30 September 2005 was 0.0m 2004: 0.0m and the liability at that date calculated in accordance with FRS 17 was 10.2m 2004: 10.0m.
The difference of 10.2m 2004: 10.0m relates to the differing bases of calculation.
a Disclosures made in accordance with FRS 17 The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2004 and updated to 30 September 2005 by a qualified independent actuary.
The service cost has been calculated using the Projected Unit method.
As a result of the Plan being closed to new entrants, the service cost will increase as the members of the Plan approach retirement.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were in nominal terms : 30 SEPTEMBER 30 SEPTEMBER 30 SEPTEMBER 2005 2004 2003 Rate of increase in salaries 3.50% p. a.
Rate of increase in deferred pensions in excess of GMP which receives statutory revaluation 2.50% p. a.
Rate of increase in pensions in payment in excess of GMP which receives statutory increases 2.50% p. a.

The principal assumptions used in the latest valuation were that the annual pre-retirement return on investment used would be 9.0% on accumulated assets, while in valuing past service benefits a return on investment of 8.0% would be used.
The annual rate of increase in pensions was assumed to be 3.5%.
The valuation revealed that the actuarial value of assets was sufficient to cover 105% of the statutory minimum liabilities in accordance with the Pensions Act 1995. c Defined contribution pension schemes In addition to the Group Pension Scheme, the Group operates a defined contribution Stakeholder pension scheme.
Contributions made by the Group to this scheme in the year ended 30 September 2005 were 0.0m 2004: 0.0m.
