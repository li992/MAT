The address of the registered office is given on page 91.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 5 and in the business review on pages 22 to 31.
These financial statements are presented in US dollars because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when the relevant standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
2 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, as adopted for use in the European Union for the first time.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 28.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union, and therefore, comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial information has been prepared on the basis of all applicable IFRS, including all International Accounting Standards IAS, Standing Interpretations Committee SIC interpretations and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB before 30 December 2005.
These include IFRS endorsed by the EU and those awaiting formal endorsement.
The rules for first adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
IFRS1 requires use of the same accounting policies in the IFRS transition balance sheet and for all periods presented thereafter.
The accounting policies must comply with all IFRS effective at the reporting date for the first financial reporting under IFRS, the period 1 January 2005 to 30 December 2005.
IFRS1 permits companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS in the transition period.
This financial information has been prepared on the basis of taking the following exemptions: a Business combinations prior to 1 January 2004 have not been restated to comply with IFRS3 Business Combinations.
b Cumulative translation differences on foreign operations are deemed to be zero at 1 January 2004.
Any gains and losses recognised in the consolidated income statement on subsequent disposals of foreign operations will therefore exclude translation differences arising prior to the transition date.
c IAS32 and IAS39 have been adopted from 1 January 2005.
There is no effect on reported profits and no restatement of comparative information is required.
d Fixed assets have not been revalued as at the date of transition.
The depreciated cost has been assumed as the effective carrying value for IFRS purposes.
The financial information presented for the year ended 31 December 2004 has been restated to comply with IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The financial statements cover the 52 week period from 1 January 2005 to 30 December 2005, the comparatives are presented for the year from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2004.
The financial statements are reported on a 52 week basis to be consistent with the Groups internal reporting.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of CSR plc the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries drawn up to the dates indicated in the primary financial statements.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 55 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2005 2 Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation continued Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair value, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of the acquisition below the fair vale of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to profit or loss in the period of acquisition.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Royalty income is recognised upon shipment of the royalty earning product by the licencee.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered on a percentage of completion basis.
Revenue from post contract support is recognised over the period of performance.
The excess of service fees and post-contract support invoiced over revenue recognised is recorded as deferred income.
Revenue is shown net of estimated provision for credit notes and returns.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly to the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of the Group is the US dollar.
Transactions in currencies other than US dollars are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the net profit or loss for the period.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts see page 59 for details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
56 Changing the way the world connects Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2005 2 Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies continued On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups exchange retranslation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Government grants Government grants towards Japanese recruitment are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs and are deducted in reporting the related expense.
Operating Profit Operating profit is stated before investment income and finance costs.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Taxation The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences, unused carried forward tax losses and unused carried forward tax credits can be utilised.
However, such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from: goodwill: the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit: investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxed levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of the assets, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following basis: Computer equipment 2 to 3 years Test equipment 2 to 5 years Office equipment 3 years Furniture and fittings 5 years Leasehold improvements minimum lease period Residual values are the estimated amount that the Group would obtain from disposal of the asset, after deducting estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date.
In general residual values are zero or negligible, due to the technical and specialised nature of assets held.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 57 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2005 2 Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment continued Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost.
Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Other intangible assets Other intangible fixed assets are stated at cost or fair value for items acquired in business combinations, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment.
No amortisation is provided on assets in the course of construction.
On other intangible fixed assets amortisation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost or fair value, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Software licences 3 to 5 years Customer contracts and relationships 3 years Purchased R&D 4 years Residual values are the estimated amount that the Group would obtain from disposal of the asset, after deducting estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Research and development expenditure Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Groups product development is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: an asset is created that can be identified such as a new device or software : the project from which the asset arises meets the Groups criteria for assessing technical feasibility: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives.
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Patents and trademarks Expenditure on patents and trademarks is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
58 Changing the way the world connects Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2005 2 Accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the FIFO method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Investments consist of money market deposits in both USD, GBP, Euros and Indian Rupees.
Interest income is recorded as it accrues over the period of the investment at rates fixed at the time of inception.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the board of directors, which provides written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
The Group hedges forecast GBP, JPY, SEK and DKR expenditure for the following 11 to 15 months.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged firm commitment or forecasted transaction affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Provisions Provisions for warranty and returns costs are recognised at the date of sale of the relevant products, at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Groups liability.
Provision is made for onerous contracts at the fair value of the minimum unavoidable lease payments.
Share-based payment The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, including share options with non-market based vesting conditions.
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 59 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2005 2 Accounting policies continued Share-based payment continued Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model for the majority of share options in issue.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
For certain share options which include TSR related conditions, the fair value is estimated through the use of a Monte-Carlo simulation.
3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of Goodwill The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
The carrying amount of goodwill at 30 December 2005 was $52,697,000 2004: $nil.
More details are given in Note 10.
Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
If actual market conditions are less favourable than those projected by management, additional inventory provisions may be required.
Provisions Determining the level of provision required for returns and warranty claims requires management to review the historic levels of usage whilst considering the growth in the business and other changes which have occurred in the manufacturing cycle.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is determined from a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to CSR.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The calculation has been based on the most recent cash flow forecasts for the next 3 years which have been approved by management.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 12%.

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts within trade receivables of $162,000 2004: $158,000.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

Comparatives are stated under UK GAAP.
The adjustments that would arise if comparatives had been presented in accordance with IAS 39 would be: Recognition of an asset or liability representing the fair value of financial instruments in issue at the balance sheet date Charge or credit to the income statement in respect of movements in the fair value of financial instruments Movements in the fair value of financial instruments would be recorded in the income statement as the Group did not meet all the requirements of IAS 39 in respect of hedge designation and documentation, as financial instruments were contracted for pre the date of transition to IFRS.
The Group would have been required to disclose the amount charged or credited to the income statement in respect of the movements in the fair value of financial instruments.
