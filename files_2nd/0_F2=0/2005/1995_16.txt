Notes to the accounts year ended 30 April 2005 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The accounts of The Berkeley Group Holdings plc have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom, apart from the exception described below.
Scheme of Arrangement and capital restructure In June 2004, The Berkeley Group plc announced proposals for the return of 12 per existing ordinary share to shareholders by way of a capital reorganisation, incorporating a Scheme of Arrangement.
Following approval by shareholders in September 2004 and ratification by the Court on 25 October 2004, shareholders, on 26 October 2004, exchanged each existing ordinary share in The Berkeley Group plc for a newly issued Unit each Unit comprising one new ordinary share of a nominal value of 0.05, one 2004 B share of a nominal value of 5.00, one 2006 B share of a nominal value of 2.00, one 2008 B share of a nominal value of 1.60 and one 2010 B share of a nominal value of 3.21 in The Berkeley Group Holdings plc the Company, thereby introducing the Company as the new parent holding company of The Berkeley Group plc and its subsidiaries.
The Company issued the shares comprised in 120,798,270 Units credited as fully paid at the aggregate nominal value of 11.86, which was the closing price of an ordinary share in The Berkeley Group plc on 25 October 2004.
The Directors intend to return the 12 per unit to shareholders by January 2011 with cash payments in respect of the B shares, subject to having sufficient funding and distributable reserves, as follows.
Class of B share Expected record date Proceeds per share 2004 B Share Paid on 3 December 2004 5 2006 B Share Friday 29 December 2006 2 2008 B Share Wednesday 31 December 2008 2 2010 B Share Friday 31 December 2010 3 Total 12 The return to shareholders has been facilitated by the Court approved reduction of capital that became effective on 28 October 2004.
Through this reduction of capital, the nominal amount of each Unit was reduced to 0.25 each Unit comprising one new ordinary share of a nominal value of 0.05, one 2004 B share of a nominal value of 0.05, one 2006 B share of a nominal value of 0.05, one 2008 B share of a nominal value of 0.05 and one 2010 B share of a nominal value of 0.05.
This reduction created distributable reserves of 1,402 million to facilitate the return of 12 per Unit.
With implementation of the Scheme of Arrangement under section 425 of the Companies Act, the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of The Berkeley Group plc.
In the opinion of the Directors, the Scheme of Arrangement is a group reconstruction rather than an acquisition, since the shareholders in the Company are the same as the former shareholders in The Berkeley Group plc and the rights of each shareholder, relative to the others, are unchanged and no minority interest in the net assets of the Group is altered.
Accordingly, the Directors have adopted merger rather than acquisition accounting principles in drawing up these accounts, having regard to the overriding requirement of section 227 6 of the Companies Act 1985 for the accounts to give a true and fair view of the Groups results and financial position.
The Directors consider that it is not practicable to quantify the effect of this departure from the Companies Act 1985 requirements.
The accounts are presented as if the Scheme of Arrangement had been effective on 1 May 2004, except for the effect of the capital restructure and subsequent reduction of capital which was sanctioned by the Court on 25 October 2004.
The consolidated profit and loss account combines the results of The Berkeley Group plc for the year ended 30 April 2005 with those of the Company for the period since its incorporation to 30 April 2005.
The comparative figures relate to The Berkeley Group plc as restated for the effect of the Scheme of Arrangement.
Further detail on the Scheme of Arrangement is set out in Note 18.
Adoption of UITF Abstracts 17 revised 2003 and 38 From 1 May 2004, the Group has adopted UITF Abstracts 17 revised 2003 and 38 in respect of employee share schemes and Employee Share Ownership Trusts.
The comparative figures have been restated to reflect the impact of the adoption of these abstracts.
Under UITF 17 revised 2003 the cost of awards made under the share schemes is now calculated with reference to the fair value of the award at the date of grant rather than the cost of shares purchased by the Group to satisfy the award.
The adoption of UITF 17 revised 2003 has resulted in an increase in staff costs of 151,000 2004: 479,000 and a decrease in profit after tax of 132,000 2004: 338,000.
The cost of shares purchased by the Groups Employee Share Ownership Trusts, previously shown as an asset in investments in the balance sheet, is now deducted from shareholders funds as required by UITF 38.
This has led to a decrease in shareholders funds at 30 April 2005 of 5,940,000 30 April 2004: 6,441,000.
The shares had a cost of 6,441,000 and a carrying value of 2,656,000 as previously reported at 30 April 2004.
The decrease in profit after tax in 2004 of 338,000 is disclosed on the face of the Statement of Group total recognised gains and losses.
The re-presentation of the ESOP shares in accordance with UITF 38 is not a recognised gain or loss.
co. uk 1 Accounting policies continued The Consolidated cash flow statement has also been restated to show the relevant cash flows in financing activities rather than capital expenditure and financial investment.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts comprise the accounts of the parent Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
The accounting date for subsidiary undertakings is 30 April.
In the case of acquisitions or disposals, the Groups result includes that proportion from or to the effective date of acquisition or disposal as appropriate.
Goodwill With effect from 1 April 1998, where the cost of acquiring new and additional interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and businesses exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the resulting premium on acquisition goodwill is capitalised and its subsequent measurement via annual impairment reviews or an annual amortisation charge will be determined based on the individual circumstances of each business acquired.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998 is not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet.
When a business is disposed of, goodwill, where applicable, is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account.
Investments The parent companys investments in subsidiary undertakings are included in the balance sheet at cost less provision for any permanent diminution in value.
Joint ventures The results attributable to the Companys holding in joint ventures are shown separately in the consolidated profit and loss account.
The amount included in the consolidated balance sheet is the Groups share of the net assets of the joint ventures plus net loans receivable.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above.
Any unamortised balance of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in joint ventures.
Turnover Turnover represents the amounts receivable from the sale of properties during the year.
On traditional developments, properties are treated as sold and profits are taken when contracts are exchanged and the building work is physically complete.
On complex multi-unit developments, revenue and profit are recognised on a staged basis, commencing when the building work is substantially complete, which is defined as being plastered and when contracts are exchanged.
This policy applies to both residential housebuilding and commercial property activities.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are carried at cost.
Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost of the assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates: Freehold property 2% Fixtures and fittings 15% 20% 1 Motor vehicles 25% Computer equipment 33 3% Leasehold property is amortised over the period of the lease.
Computer equipment is included within fixtures and fittings.
Stocks Property in the course of development is valued at the lower of direct cost and net realisable value.
Direct cost comprises the cost of land, raw materials and development costs but excludes indirect overheads and interest.
Progress payments are deducted from work in progress.
Provision is made, where appropriate, to reduce the value of stocks and work in progress to their net realisable value.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not been reversed by the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable and have not been discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet dates.
Financial instruments From time to time the Group makes use of interest rate swaps and caps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
Interest rate instruments are treated as hedges and the net interest payable or receivable is reflected in the profit and loss account.
Pension costs The expected cost of providing pensions on defined benefit schemes is recognised on a systematic basis over the period during which benefit is derived from the employees services.
Pension contributions under defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred for defined benefits pension schemes.
A valuation is performed every three years.
Leasing and rental agreements Payments under rental and operating lease agreements are charged against profit on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Share incentive schemes The intrinsic value of awards under the Groups Long-Term Incentive Plans are charged against profit on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the awards, based on the Groups estimate of awards that will eventually vest.
Shares held in trust to satisfy these awards are treated as a deduction from shareholders funds.
Included in Group residential housebuilding turnover and operating margin are 16,139,000 and 6,600,000 in respect of land sales 2004: 11,426,000 and 2,382,000.

The market value of the Berkeley Final Salary Plan assets at 1 May 2004 was 18,100,000 and was sufficient to cover 72% of the schemes liabilities.
Employers contributions are currently paid at 21.1% and it is proposed to maintain this level of contribution thereby reducing the deficit to zero over the expected remaining service life of existing members.
In addition, there is an accrual at 30 April 2005 of 2,098,000 2004: 1,525,000 resulting from the difference in amounts charged to the profit and loss account and the amounts paid to the scheme.

Under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, the required disclosures relating to the Berkeley Final Salary Plan are set out below.
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 1 May 2004, and updated by the scheme actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 30 April 2005.
The assets of the scheme are stated at their market value at 30 April 2005.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: Valuation at 30 April 2005 30 April 2004 30 April 2003 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.80% 4.00% 3.50% Rate of increase to pensions in payment post-97 and deferred pensions 3.60% 3.70% 2.50% Pre-97 pensions receive 3.00% increases Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.30% 5.70% 5.50% Inflation assumption 2.80% 3.00% 2.50% The assets in the scheme and the expected rate of return were: Valuation at 30 April 2005 30 April 2004 30 April 2003 Long-term Long-term Long-term rate of Value rate of Value rate of Value return 000 return 000 return 000 Equities 7.50% 16,080 8.00% 14,534 7.00% 11,300 Government bonds 4.50% 2,165 5.00% 1,740 5.50% 1,890 Corporate bonds 4.90% 2,150 5.40% 1,741 Property 5.50% 771 Other 4.70% 1,041 4.40% 336 4.00% 1,005 Total market value of assets 21,436 18,351 14,966 Present value of scheme liabilities 33,470 27,173 29,548 Deficit in the scheme 12,034 8,822 14,582 Related deferred tax asset 3,610 2,647 4,374 Net pension liability 8,424 6,175 10,208 The present value of scheme liabilities as at 30 April 2004 has been restated following the 1 May 2004 valuation of the Plan.
This has resulted in a reduction in the present value of scheme liabilities at that date of 12,274,000 to 27,173,000.
This amount has been treated as a change in actuarial assumptions in the analysis of the amount recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses below, which now shows an actuarial gain of 6,505,000.
If the above amounts had been recognised in the financial statements, the Groups net assets and profit and loss reserves at 30 April 2005 and 30 April 2004 would be as follows: 2005 2004 Restated 000 000 Net assets excluding SSAP 24 pension liability 671,580 1,144,135 Net pension liability under FRS 17 8,424 6,175 Net assets including FRS 17 pension liability 663,156 1,137,960 Profit and loss reserves excluding SSAP 24 pension liability 1,601,860 682,064 Net pension liability under FRS 17 8,424 6,175 Profit and loss reserves including FRS 17 pension liability 1,593,436 675,889 54 www.

The loss for the period dealt with in the accounts of the Company is 14,966,000.
11 Earnings per Ordinary Share Earnings per Ordinary Share is based on the profit after taxation of 144,643,000 2004 restated: 162,020,000 and the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year of 119,558,439 2004: 124,261,151 adjusted to exclude shares held by the Company to satisfy awards under its long term incentive plan.
For diluted earnings per Ordinary Share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume the conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
The dilutive potential Ordinary Shares relate to shares granted under employee share schemes where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Ordinary Shares during the year.
The effect of the dilutive potential shares is 990,459 shares 2004: 613,585, giving a diluted weighted average number of shares of 120,548,898 2004: 124,874,736.
Net assets per Ordinary Share is calculated based on net assets at the end of the year divided by the number of Ordinary Shares in issue at the end of the year of 119,905,035 2004: 120,984,992.
This excludes shares held by the Company to satisfy awards under its long term incentive plan.
Return on Capital Employed ROCE is calculated based on profit before interest, tax and goodwill amortisation divided by the average shareholders funds plus average net debt.
Investment in own shares Following the implementation of Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 during the year, the cost of shares held by the Groups Employee Share Ownership Trusts, previously shown as an asset in investments in the balance sheet, is now deducted from shareholders funds.

co. uk 63 Notes to the accounts continued year ended 30 April 2005 18 Share capital continued On 26 October 2004, the Court sanctioned a Scheme of Arrangement as explained in Note 1.
Approval of the Scheme of Arrangement triggered the rights of employees to exercise options under the Groups share option schemes which would not otherwise have been exercisable.
The effect of this is described where relevant below.
Options under the SAYE Scheme were normally exercisable within a six-month period on the expiry of three or five years from the commencement of the sharesave contract.
Under the Scheme of Arrangement, all such options became exercisable to the extent of savings and interest up to the date of exercise.
These exercises were permitted for up to six months from the date of Court approval of the Scheme of Arrangement.
During the year, no options were granted, 125,892 options lapsed and 116,223 options were exercised at prices between 599.5p and 791.7p.
No further options will be granted under this scheme.
Options under the 1994 Scheme were normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Under the Scheme of Arrangement, any options which remained unexercised would have lapsed within six months of the Scheme of Arrangement becoming effective.
During the year no options were granted, 1,380 options lapsed and there were exercises of 39,807 options at prices between 554.0p and 655.8p.
Options under the 1996 Scheme were normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Exercise of these options was conditional upon meeting a defined earnings per Ordinary Share criterion over a three-year period.
Any options which remained unexercised would have lapsed within six months of the Scheme of Arrangement becoming effective.
During the year, no options were granted, 1,120 options lapsed and 38,459 options were exercised at prices of between 551.0p and 650.0p.
Options under the 2000 Approved Plan were normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Exercise of these options was conditional upon meeting defined performance targets based on the increase in earnings per Ordinary Share over a three-year period.
Any options which were not exercisable before the Scheme of Arrangement, became exercisable when the Court sanctioned the Scheme of Arrangement.
During the year, no options were granted, 53,195 options lapsed and 464,457 options were exercised at prices of between 560.5p and 762.5p.
Options under the 2000 Plan were normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Options granted in 2000 and 2001 had already vested at the date of the Scheme of Arrangement, and remained exercisable for six months from the date that the Court sanctioned the Scheme.
During the year, no options were granted, 17,451 options lapsed and 193,648 options were exercised at prices between 576.5p and 712.5p.
Options granted under the 2000 Plan in 2002, 2003 and 2004 were not exercisable at the date of the Scheme of Arrangement.
The Remuneration Committee resolved that these options would not become exercisable by virtue of the Scheme of Arrangement.
Instead holders of these options were offered two alternatives.
The optionholders could exchange their options on the basis of one Unit in The Berkeley Group Holdings plc for one share in The Berkeley Group plc.
These options would only have become exercisable on the original vesting date.
Alternatively optionholders were offered the opportunity to release their options in consideration for a conditional cash compensation payment.
The compensation was equal to the difference between the weighted average price of an Ordinary Share in The Berkeley Group plc in the ten days prior to the Scheme of Arrangement becoming effective 12.08 and the exercise price multiplied by the number of options over shares in The Berkeley Group plc.
The relevant amount will only be paid after the released option would have become exercisable and if the relevant individual is an employee of the Group on the relevant date except where an optionholder ceases to be employed in the Group before that date for a reason which would have permitted the released option to be exercised under the rules of the 2000 Plan, in which case the compensation will be paid on the date of cessation.
96,854 options lapsed in the period prior to the Scheme of Arrangement and 831,996 options were released at the date of the Scheme of Arrangement in consideration for a future cash compensation payment which is payable on the original vesting date.
No further options will be quoted under this Scheme.

The objectives are to manage financial risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is maintained to meet foreseeable needs, and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
It is the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits and net borrowings.
The Groups financial instruments comprise cash at bank and in hand, bank loans and overdrafts, loan stock, fixed asset investments, debtors and creditors.
From time to time the Group uses derivative instruments when commercially appropriate to manage cash flow risk by altering the interest rates on investments and funding so that the resulting exposure gives greater certainty of future costs.
The main types of instruments used from time to time are interest swaps and caps.
During the year and at the year end the Group held no such instruments 2004: nil.
All of the operations carried out by the Group are in sterling and hence the Group has no exposure to currency risk.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all of the following disclosures.
Financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities are as follows: 2005 2004 000 000 Unsecured loan stock 88 120 Bank loans due within one year 25,000 Bank loans due after one year 600,000 75,000 Other creditors due after one year 36,009 9,579 636,097 109,699 During the year, the Group renegotiated its banking arrangements as part of the capital restructure see Note 1.
The Group negotiated syndicated term and revolving facilities of 825 million in total.
This includes a 500 million seven-year term facility, a 175 million three-year revolving facility and a 150 million 364 day revolving facility with a term out option.

The sale completed on 8 July 2005.
Terms of the disposal The consideration comprises in aggregate 235.7 million in respect of the Crosby A Shares held by the Group including the repayment of the inter-company indebtedness owned to Berkeley by Crosby at 30 April 2005.
In addition, the Group will be repaid 15 million in respect of working capital provided to Crosby since 30 April 2005.
Under the agreement the Group has entered into normal warranties and indemnities.
In addition, it has entered into various covenants including an undertaking restricting the number of developments it can undertake in Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester.
Background to the transaction Following the strategic review reported on 26 June 2003 the board of Berkeley decided to concentrate on increasingly complex mixed-use urban regeneration projects in London and Southern England.
The management of Crosby proposed maximising the value of the assets within Crosby and incentivising them by acquiring a shareholding in Crosby.
At this time Crosby was a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkeley.
On 27 August 2003, Berkeley entered into an agreement whereby the Crosby Managers, led by Geoff Hutchinson, subscribed for newly issued shares in Crosby Crosby B Shares for a consideration of 500,000, funded by a loan from Berkeley together the Crosby transaction.
Following this subscription the share capital of Crosby comprised Crosby A Shares, held by Berkeley, and Crosby B Shares, held by the Crosby Managers.
Berkeley retained control of Crosby through its holding of Crosby A Shares and continued to consolidate Crosby as a subsidiary.
Under the terms of the Crosby Transaction, Crosby had to make agreed milestone payments to Berkeley every six months and generate in aggregate 450 million of operating cashflow within seven years of the date of the subscription.
It was agreed that if these two criteria were met, the Crosby B Shares are broadly entitled to 50.01% of the economic and voting rights of Crosby.
In addition, Berkeley would retain voting control of Crosby until the gross assets and net assets of Crosby fall below 75 million and 50 million, respectively, at which point voting control of Crosby passes to the Crosby Managers and Crosby ceases to be consolidated by the Group.
The sale of Crosby B Shares to Lend Lease is outside the control of the Group and has been the subject of separate negotiation between the Crosby Managers and Lend Lease.
Upon receipt of the consideration of the sale of their Crosby B Shares to Lend Lease for 10 million, the Crosby Managers will repay to the Group the 500,000 loan mentioned above.
As part of the Disposal, Berkeley and the Crosby Managers will enter into a Termination Deed, pursuant to which the arrangements put in place at the time of the Crosby Transaction will be terminated.
