7 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of 25.7m 2004: 19.7m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the profit for the financial year of 25.7m 2004: 19.7m and the weighted average number of shares in issue are adjusted to assume the exercise of options over shares.
Earnings per share before goodwill amortisation and impairment are calculated in order to provide a better understanding of the Groups earnings.
The profit attributable to shareholders of 25.7m 2004: 19.7m is adjusted for goodwill amortisation and impairment of 0.9m 2004: 6.4m and the total of 26.6m 2004: 26.1m is then divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

The goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the Groups share of net assets acquired.
Neither acquisition had any significant fair value adjustments.
Goodwill is being amortised over the remainder of an estimated useful economic life of 20 years, being the Directors estimate of its useful economic life.
The Other intangible represents an option to purchase land at Elland Road, Leeds.
The fair value of the consideration was paid to purchase all the issued share capital of a company, Stanley Casinos Leeds Limited, whose only asset was this option.
During the year this company was transferred from the Group into a joint venture with Genting Berhad, changing its name to Stanley Genting Casinos Leeds Limited.

On 24 January 2005, the Group renewed the 275m revolving credit facility.
Interest under this facility is payable at rates between 0.475% and 0.85% above LIBOR, depending upon financial covenant performance.
On completion of the disposal of the Groups Retail Betting Operation as detailed in note 23, the Groups borrowing facility was amended and reduced from 275m to 150m.

No provision has been made for potential Group capital gains tax payable of 86.0m 2004: 86.0m if properties were to be sold at their revalued amounts.
Although a large number of properties left the Group following the disposal of the Retail Betting Operation, as detailed in note 23, the disposal was of companies rather than individual properties and therefore there was no impact on the potential deferred tax amount shown above.
Translation differences of nil 2004: 0.1m on foreign currency loans have been offset against the translation differences on the net investment in overseas undertakings.

Two of the schemes are dened contribution.
The pension charge represents contributions payable by the Group to both schemes and amounted to 1.6m 2004: 1.4m.
The third scheme, the Stanley Leisure 1988 Retirement benefit Scheme, is a dened benefit scheme which provides benets based on final pensionable earnings.
Membership has not been offered since 2 February 2001 and the scheme is, therefore, effectively closed to new entrants.
This has not affected the status or rights of existing members.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the profit and Loss Account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Group.
The pension charge for the year in respect of the Group for the dened benefit scheme was 0.6m 2004: 0.5m.
The contributions are determined by a qualied independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the attained age valuation method.
The most recent formal valuation was at 1 February 2004.
The valuation showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 8.4m and the actuarial value of these assets represented 85% of the value of benets which had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The main assumptions which affect the results of the valuation include an assumed rate of future investment returns of 7.75% per annum during the period prior to a members retirement and 5.5% per annum during the period post retirement: an assumed rate of future salary growth of 2.75% per annum and for pensions in payment which increase each year by 5.0% or the change in the R. P. I. if less an assumed rate of increase of 2.5% per annum.
FRS 17 The Company sponsors the Stanley Leisure 1988 Retirement benefit Scheme which is a dened benefit arrangement.
The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualied independent actuary as at 1 February 2004 and updated on an approximate basis to 1 May 2005.
The contributions made by the Group over the financial year were as shown above.
The current contribution rate of 6.9% of pensionable pay plus 0.2m was to continue until reviewed following the triennial valuation of the scheme due as at 1 February 2007.
However, following a payment of 4.8m into the scheme on 21 June 2005, the additional contribution of 0.2m per annum is no longer deemed necessary.
As the scheme is closed to new entrants, the current service cost as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.
The transitional arrangements of the new accounting standard FRS 17 require disclosure of assets and liabilities as at 1 May 2005 calculated in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17.
They also require disclosure of the items which would appear in the profit and Loss Account and in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses were the full requirements of FRS 17 in place.
For the purpose of these financial statements, all of these gures are illustrative only and do not impact on the actual 1 May 2005 balance sheet or on this years performance statements.
