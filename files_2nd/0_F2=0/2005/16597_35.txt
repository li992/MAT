For the share options a calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated as above is deducted from the number of outstanding share options to give the number of share options with dilutive effect.
