Notes to the financial statements Forming part of the financial statements 1 Accounting policies i Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain fixed asset investments.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the groups financial statements, other than the group have adopted UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts and netted off investments in own shares against the profit and loss account reserve, hence prior period retained earnings and investments have been restated.
ii Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 March 2005.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the group has a long-term interest and over which it exercises joint control.
The groups share of profits less losses of joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net assets, other than goodwill, is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
Under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
iii Turnover Turnover is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the turnover can be readily measured.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before turnover is recognised: Sale of Goods Turnover is recognised when the group obtains the right to consideration in exchange for its performance, which is usually when title passes.
Rendering of Services Turnover from services rendered is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
Long term Contracts Turnover is recognised when, and to the extent that the group obtains the right to consideration.
This is derived from an assessment of the fair value of the work performed to the reporting date as a proportion of the total fair value of the contract.
iv Goodwill Purchased goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions before 1 April 1998, when Financial Reporting Standard 10: Goodwill and Intangible Assets was adopted, was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition.
Goodwill previously eliminated against reserves has not been reinstated on implementation of FRS 10.
Positive goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions after 1 April 1998 is capitalised, classified as an asset on the balance sheet and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life up to a presumed maximum of twenty years.
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other subsequent periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If a subsidiary undertaking or business is subsequently sold or closed, any goodwill arising on acquisition that was written off directly to reserves or that has not been amortised through the profit and loss account is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on sale or closure.
v Fixed assets and depreciation Depreciation is provided on tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land and assets in course of construction, at rates calculated to write off the cost less residual value of each asset on a straight line basis over the expected useful life as follows: 44 VT Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Notes to the financial statements continued Forming part of the financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued Freehold and long leasehold buildings 30 to 50 years Leasehold land and short leasehold buildings unexpired period of lease Computers 3 years Office furniture and equipment 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years Plant and machinery 5 to 10 years Heavy equipment 20 to 33 years Interest costs relating to specific project financing are capitalised up to the date of completion of the project.
vi Employee share schemes The following trusts own shares in VT Group plc: a The Vosper Thornycroft Employees Share Ownership Trust which is a discretionary trust for the benefit of executives and directors holding shares to satisfy the groups liabilities to employees and directors for the long term incentive plan.
Dividends on these shares have been waived during the period that they are within the trust except for those relating to shares held as Retained Shares under the terms of the trust which are paid to the beneficiaries on a timely basis.
The net cost to the group of these shares apart from the Retained Shares is charged to the profit and loss account over the period to which they relate.
b The Vosper Thornycroft Holdings plc Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust which is a discretionary trust for the benefit of employees holding from time to time shares to satisfy the groups liabilities under its Savings related Share Option Scheme and Sharesave Scheme 1998.
The dividends on these shares are waived during the period they are within the trust.
The shares were initially purchased with a loan from the group which has been progressively repaid as options are exercised.
vii Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
For work in progress and finished goods, cost is taken as production cost, which includes an appropriate proportion of attributable overheads.
viii Long term contracts The amount of profit attributable to the stage of completion of a long term contract is recognised when the outcome of the contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty.
Turnover for such contracts is stated at cost appropriate to their stage of completion plus attributable profits, less amounts recognised in previous years.
Provision is made for any losses as soon as they are foreseen.
Contracts work in progress is stated at costs incurred, less those transferred to the profit and loss account, after deducting foreseeable losses and payments on account not matched with turnover.
Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in debtors and represent turnover recognised in excess of payments on account.
ix Pension costs The group operates a number of contributory pension schemes, both defined benefit and money purchase, and accounts for pension costs in accordance with the requirements of SSAP24.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the group.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the service lives of pensionable employees.
The group has adopted the transitional disclosure requirements of FRS 17. x Research and development Expenditure on research is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on development work is charged to the specific contract to which it relates and is carried in work in progress.
VT Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2005 45 Notes to the financial statements continued Forming part of the financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued xi Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19. xii Leased assets Operating lease rentals receivables are charged credited to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis, over the period of the lease.
xiii Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in local currency at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the year end exchange rates or at the rate at which they are hedged if appropriate.
Exchange gains and losses arising on foreign currency borrowings used to finance subsidiary undertakings are taken to reserves to the extent that they can be offset against the exchange differences arising on the equity investment.
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated on consolidation into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the results are translated using the average exchange rates for the period.
These consolidation differences on exchange are taken to reserves.
All other exchange differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
xiv Financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
Immediately a contractual requirement is known the group enters into a forward contract to eliminate any exposure that may arise on future transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Contract profits or losses taken to the profit and loss account are assessed using these forward contract rates.
Changes in the fair value of these instruments have no affect on the profit and loss account and are therefore not recognised in the financial statements.
xv Accounting for PFI contracts The group considers the accounting treatment of PFI assets on a contract by contract basis and determines whether the risks and rewards associated with the assets are retained or passed to the purchaser.
If the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the group the assets are allocated to fixed assets, otherwise a financial asset for the fair value of future income is allocated to debtors in accordance with the relevant accounting standards.
It is group policy to expense all bid costs until preferred bidder status has been achieved.
xvi Liquid resources For the purposes of the cash flow statement, liquid resources are defined as current asset investments and short term deposits.
Shipbuilding includes all activities in respect of designing and or building ships, the design and supply of electronic control systems, steering gear, stabilisers, bow thrusters, water jets, ride control equipment and the manufacture of engineering products.
