46 East Surrey Holdings plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 11 Pensions Sutton and East Surrey Water plc SESW participates in the Water Companies Pension Scheme WCPS for their employees.
The WCPS is a final salary scheme, providing members with benefits related to pay and service at rates which are defined under the rules.
To finance these benefits, assets are accumulated in the scheme and are held separately from the assets of SESW.
SESW pays contributions to the WCPS at rates in accordance with the advice of the schemes actuaries, based on regular actuarial reviews of the financial position of the scheme.
The scheme is now closed to new employees.
Under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The total pension cost for 2005 for this scheme was 1,051,000 1,033,000.
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at either the beginning or end of the financial year.
The pension cost allows for an offset of 17.6% of payroll in respect of the amortisation over a period of 11 years of the schemes assets relating to SESW in excess of the accrued liabilities.
The pension cost has been determined in accordance with the advice of professionally qualified consulting actuaries based on an actuarial valuation made as at 1 April 2002.
The most significant actuarial assumptions used in this valuation for determining pension costs were: valuation method - projected unit: rate of return on investments - 7.2% pa before retirement and 5.2% pa after retirement: rate of increase in pay - 4.8% pa: rate of increase in pensions - 2.8% pa: valuation of assets - the assets were valued by discounting the expected future investment proceeds that would arise from notionally re-investing the market value at the valuation date in a mixed portfolio of equities and gilts.
The actuarial valuation at 1 April 2002 showed that the market value of that part of the schemes assets relating to SESW was 57.4 million excluding assets relating to members voluntary contributions.
On the above assumptions the actuarial value of those assets represented 115% of the value of benefits that had accrued to SESWs pensions, deferred pensioners and members based on past service allowing for assumed future pay and pension increases.
Other Group companies provide money purchase schemes for employees.
The actuarial valuation was updated to 31 March 2005, by an independent qualified actuary, using the following major assumptions in accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS17.

The deficit is planned to be recovered over the average remaining length of service of the contributing members.
