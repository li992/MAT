The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are determined from value in use calculations in which the principal assumptions are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs.
Management uses discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the relevant cash generating units.
Growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market in which the cash generating units operate.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows for the following seven years based on estimated growth rates that do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows resulting from these projections was 8.5% 2004 9.0%.

The Group is subject to two financial covenants in respect of its committed borrowing facilities.
The ratio of net debt to consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation must not exceed 2.5 times, and the ratio of consolidated operating profit to the consolidated net interest charge must not be less than 3.0 times.
The financial covenants are calculated by applying frozen UK GAAP as at 31 December 2002 and are therefore unaffected by accounting changes associated with the transition to IFRS.

RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES The Groups policy in relation to financial risk management is set out in detail in the Operating and Financial Review.
The Groups central treasury function is responsible for the procurement of the Groups capital resources and for the maintenance of an efficient capital structure, together with the management of the Groups liquidity, foreign exchange and interest rate exposures.
All treasury operations are conducted within strict policies and guidelines that are approved by the Board.
Compliance with those polices and guidelines is monitored by the regular reporting of treasury activities to the Board.
A key element of the Groups treasury philosophy is that funding, interest rate and currency decisions and the location of cash and debt balances are determined independently of each other.
The Groups borrowing requirements are met by raising funds in the most favourable markets, and the desired currency profile of net debt is achieved by entering into currency derivative contracts typically forward currency contracts and currency swaps.
The desired interest rate profile of net debt is achieved by entering into interest rate derivative contracts after taking into account any foreign currency derivatives that have been entered into to manage the currency profile of net debt.
From time to time, the Group also enters into currency derivative contracts to manage currency transaction exposures.
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
The Group ensures that its portfolio of derivative financial instruments is managed such that there is no significant concentration of credit risk in any one bank or other financial institution.
