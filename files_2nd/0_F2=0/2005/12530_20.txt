They have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
With the exception of the adoption of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, they have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Pension costs The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund.
The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997.
The group has adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benefits during the year.
The amounts charged to operating profit regarding the defined benefits scheme are the current service costs and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account if the benefits have vested.
If the benefits do not vest immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs.
The interest costs and the expected return on the assets are shown as a net amount of other financial costs or credits adjacent to interest.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method, and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return as a high quality corporate bond or equivalent currency item to the scheme liabilities.
The actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date.
The resulting defined benefit asset or liability, net of related deferred tax, is presented separately after other assets on the face of the balance sheet.
Prior to the adoption of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, the company accounted for pension costs in line with SSAP 24.
Under SSAP 24, the expected cost of providing pensions as calculated by an independent actuary was charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the service lives of the employees.
The prior year adjustment in respect of the implementation of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits is disclosed in note 12.
Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as of the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the period end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the period end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the date of the transactions is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
Cash flow statement No cash flow statement is prepared for the company under FRS 1 as the cash flows of the company have been included in the group cash flow statement of Premier Oil plc.
Related party transactions The company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 with regard to the non-disclosure of transactions between group companies.
Share-based payments The company has applied the requirements of FRS 20, Share-Based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The company issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the binomial model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised as the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date for cash-settled share-based payments.
70 Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2005 1 Significant accounting policies continued Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the following exceptions: provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable: and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
2 Loss for the year As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year.
Premier Oil plc reported a loss for the financial year ended 31 December 2005 of US$3.6 million 2004: restated US$28.4 million.
The auditors remuneration for audit services to the company was US$10,000 2004: US$10,000.

7 Pension liability 2005 2004 $ million $ million UK funded pension scheme 7.0 6.2 UK unfunded pension scheme 0.9 1.7 7.9 7.9 The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK The Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme.
The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution scheme, was started.
Both schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
Contributions to the Scheme are determined by a qualified actuary using the Attained Age Method.
As a consequence of being closed to new entrants, the current service costs of the Scheme under the FRS 17 valuation will increase as the members approach retirement.
The company has adopted FRS 17 in the current year and the pension cost figures in these financial statements comply with FRS 17.
The comparative figures for 2004 have been restated as if FRS 17 had applied for that financial year.
See note 12 for the effect of the adoption on the prior year balance sheet and profit and loss reserves.
The pension costs for the Scheme are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The most recent formal valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2005 using the Attained Age Method and a market-related funding basis, of which the principal financial assumptions were investment return: 6.5 per cent pa, salary growth: 4.8 per cent pa and pension increases: 2.8 per cent pa.
The market value of the Scheme assets was 9.9 million and, on the specific method and the assumptions adopted, the assets covered 93 per cent of the members accrued benefits based on projected pensionable salaries.
During 2005, the employer contributed to the Scheme at a rate of 26 per cent of pensionable salaries up to 31 July 2005 and, as at 1 August 2005, at 19 per cent of pensionable salaries together with a further monthly amount of 18,500: in addition, the employer paid a lump sum contribution of 960,000 in May 2005.
Aside from any further lump sum contribution, the employer expects to contribute 328,000 to the Scheme in 2006.
In accordance with FRS 17, the actuarial calculations have been carried out using the projected unit method.
The principal financial assumptions adopted for this actuarial valuation were: % Rate of investment return 6.5% pa Rate of salary increases 4.8% pa Rate of pension increases 2.8% pa Major assumptions used at 31 December: 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Discount rate 4.8% pa 5.3% pa 5.4% pa 5.5% pa 5.8% pa Salary growth 4.9% pa 4.8% pa 4.8% pa 4.3% pa 4.5% pa Price inflation 2.9% pa 2.8% pa 2.8% pa 2.3% pa 2.5% pa Increases to pensions in payment 2.9% pa 2.8% pa 2.8% pa 2.3% pa 2.5% pa 72 Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2005 7 Pension liability continued Expected rates of return and market value of the Schemes assets at 31 December: 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Expected Assets Expected Assets Expected Assets Expected Assets Expected Assets rate of return $ million rate of return $ million rate of return $ million rate of return $ million rate of return $ million Equities 6.8% pa 8.7 7.3% pa 8.4 7.1% pa 6.9 7.0% pa 5.2 7.2% pa 6.8 Bonds 4.8% pa 5.9 5.3% pa 5.4 5.1% pa 9.3 5.0% pa 6.4 5.2% pa 6.0 Cash 4.5% pa 6.5 4.7% pa 5.1 3.8% pa 4.0% pa 1.4 4.0% pa Valuations of the Schemes assets and liabilities at 31 December: 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million Total fair value of Scheme assets 21.1 18.9 16.2 13.0 12.8 Present value of Scheme liabilities 28.1 25.1 20.9 17.4 16.8 Deficit in Scheme 7.0 6.2 4.7 4.4 4.0 No deferred tax asset has been recognised in relation to the pension deficit because in the opinion of the directors there will be no suitable tax gains available in the foreseeable future.

In practice, the Scheme invests in both equities and bonds and the future funding of the Scheme will continue to have regard to the statutory obligations in respect of the Minimum Funding Requirement and to conventional funding assessments.
Unfunded pensions In addition, the group is paying an unfunded pension to a former director of the company in regard to which annual increases and a reversionary spouses pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Schemes pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2005 of the future payments projected to be made in respect of unfunded pensions is US$0.9 million 2004: US$1.7 million.
