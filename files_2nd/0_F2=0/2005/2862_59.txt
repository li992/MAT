The total employer contributions to the dened benefit plans in 2006 are expected to be 12.1m 2005: 12.9m in respect of the Capita scheme, 0.8m 2005: 0.8m in respect of the Eastgate scheme and 3.6m 2005: 2.9m in respect of the Other schemes.
The service costs have been determined using the projected unit credit method, as required.
As some of the sections are closed to new entrants, the service cost expressed as a % of pensionable salaries would be expected to increase as the average age of the membership increases.

The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS of 77.8m of which an IFRS transitional adjustment of 67.7m was taken directly to equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense before 1 January 2004.
