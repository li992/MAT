S. and have been recognised on the basis that the Directors are of the opinion based on recent and forecast trading, that sufficient suitable taxable profits will be generated in the relevant territories in future accounting periods, such that it is considered more likely than not than these assets will be recovered.
The unrecognised deferred tax asset of 18.2 million 2004 29.9 million above relates primarily to overseas tax losses where there is insufficient certainty that these losses will be utilised in the immediate future.
ii No deferred tax has been provided on revalued assets due to the availability of realised capital losses for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
iii There are additional unprovided capital losses carried forward which have not yet been agreed with the Inland Revenue.
iv The Group is able to obtain tax relief in some overseas territories for the cost of goodwill arising on its acquisitions of some businesses.
In certain cases the goodwill was written off to reserves under the transitional rules set out in FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Fixed Assets.
Utilisation of the available tax relief in the overseas territories gives rise to a timing difference as set out above.
The potential timing differences will only reverse on sale of the relevant businesses.
As the relevant businesses are considered core to the Group there is currently no intention to dispose of them.
The potential reversal is so far into the future that after discounting, the potential liability becomes insignificant.
The effect of discounting the Groups accelerated capital allowances is a credit of 2.2 million 2004 3.2 million.
The effect of discounting the Groups other deferred tax assets and liabilities is not material.
