Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding year except that Urgent Issues Task Force abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts UITF 38 has been adopted for the first time and comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
The effects of UITF 38 are explained in note 12 below.
a Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, except as disclosed in note 1 i below.
b Basis of consolidation The group financial statements comprise a consolidation of the financial statements of the company and all of its subsidiaries at 31 March, except where severe long-term restrictions hinder the control of the assets, or management of the subsidiary or where the interest in the subsidiary undertaking is held exclusively with a view to subsequent resale.
The results of companies acquired or disposed of are consolidated from the effective date of the acquisition or to the effective date of disposal.
The treatment of a company as an associated undertaking has regard to the groups holding of at least 20 per cent of the equity capital, representation on its board of Directors and participation in policy making, including dividend policy.
The groups share of the profits or losses of these companies is included in the profit and loss account and the investments are included in the balance sheet at the groups share of the net assets of the companies.
An entity is treated as a joint venture if the group jointly controls that entity together with one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement.
The groups share of turnover, operating profit and interest in joint ventures has been reported on the face of the profit and loss account and the groups share of gross assets and liabilities has been reported on the balance sheet.
Intra-group sales and profit are eliminated fully on consolidation.
c Goodwill On the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking, fair values are attributed to the net identifiable assets or liabilities acquired.
Goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration and the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Fair values are assessed in accordance with FRS 7 Fair Values in Acquisition Accounting.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 31 March 1998 was set off directly against reserves and has not been reinstated on implementation of FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
Positive goodwill arising on acquisitions since this date is capitalised in the financial statements as an intangible asset and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life.
On disposal of a subsidiary any goodwill arising on acquisition that was previously written off to reserves, or that has not been amortised through the profit and loss account is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
d Associates and joint ventures The groups share of turnover and profit and loss of associates and joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account.
The groups share of their net assets is included in the consolidated balance sheet.
These amounts are taken from the latest audited financial statements of the undertakings concerned or from coterminous management accounts if the balance sheet date in those audited financial statements is greater than three months from the balance sheet date of the relevant group financial statements.
To the extent that joint ventures and associates have net liabilities, the aggregate amount is added back to the amount of investments, and transferred to provisions.
The group share of turnover and profit or loss of unincorporated joint ventures is included in arriving at operating profit and its share of individual assets and liabilities is included, where appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheet.
Construction Profits on short-term contracts are included in the financial statements upon substantial completion of those contracts.
Profits on long-term contracts are included in the financial statements when the outcome of a contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty and are determined by reference to an internal valuation of measured work carried out less related costs of production.
Provision is made in full for foreseeable losses.
Property development Profit is included in the financial statements in connection with property developments when a legally binding contract for the sale of the development has been entered into and legal completion has taken place before the year end.
When legally binding contracts exist, profits on the construction and refurbishment elements of the development are determined on the same basis as for Construction.
Other profits arising from developments are included in the financial statements only when legal completion of the sale of development has been effected.
Claims In establishing turnover and profit, credit is taken for claims only when negotiations are at an advanced stage and the outcome is substantially agreed by the client.
Having released such claims in the profit and loss account, provision is made whenever ultimate payment seems doubtful.
Insurance claims and other recoveries Where some of the forecast expenditure on a contract is expected to be reimbursed by another party such as an insurance company the reimbursement is recognised only when receipt of the amount is virtually certain.
Annual Report and Accounts 2005 53 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued f Turnover Turnover represents the income receivable excluding value added tax in the ordinary course of business for goods and services provided and, in respect of contract work in progress, the value of work carried out when it can be estimated reliably.
Turnover of development properties and private finance initiative projects which are not held for the long-term is recorded when a sale is completed in accordance with the profit recognition criteria in 1 e above.
Turnover includes sales of directly held work in progress and interests in special purpose subsidiaries and joint ventures if the substance of the transaction is the sale of the underlying property.
Turnover of Anglian Water includes an estimation of the amount of main water and wastewater charges unbilled at the year end.
The accrual is estimated using a defined methodology based upon weighted average water consumption by tariff, which is calculated based upon historical billing information.
The calculation is sensitive to estimated consumption for domestic customers a fall of 1 cubic metre in average annual consumption reduces turnover by approximately 1.0 million.
g Intangible fixed assets and amortisation Intangible fixed assets comprise goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, premiums paid to acquire unincorporated businesses and payments to acquire licences to operate plant, mainly in overseas locations.
Goodwill is generally amortised over 20 years, being the Directors best estimate of its useful economic life, or the life of the contract if less than 20 years.
At the end of each full year after an acquisition and following the occurrence of an impairment trigger in any year, the carrying amount of goodwill is assessed for impairment by comparing it with the higher of net present value of future cash flows and the expected net realisable value.
Should the carrying amount exceed the higher of these two measures, an impairment charge arises in the profit and loss account in the year.
Licences are amortised over the period of the licence agreement, currently 20 years.
Licences are assessed for impairment in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill, if an appropriate trigger arises.
h Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets comprise: i. Infrastructure assets Infrastructure assets comprise a network of systems consisting of mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, sludge pipelines and sea outfalls.
Investment expenditure on infrastructure assets relating to increases in capacity or enhancements of the network and on maintaining the operating capability of the network in accordance with defined standards of service, is treated as an addition and recorded at cost along with related grants and contributions.
The depreciation charge for infrastructure assets is the estimated level of annual expenditure required to maintain the operating capability of the network, which is based on the groups independently certified Asset Management Plan.
Other assets Other assets comprise land and buildings, operational assets comprising sites used for water and wastewater treatment, pumping or storage where not classed as infrastructure and vehicles, plant and equipment, and are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes own work capitalised comprising the direct cost of materials, labour and applicable overheads.
Interest costs are not capitalised.
A number of changes have been made to the assets included in each asset class.
Opening balances by asset class have been restated to reflect the changes, but there is no impact on the total recorded net book value of tangible fixed assets.
Further details are disclosed in note 14.
Freehold land is not depreciated nor are assets in the course of construction until commissioned.
Depreciation of other assets is calculated at rates expected to write off cost less the estimated residual value of the relevant assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, which are principally as follows: Operational assets 30-80 years Buildings 30-60 years Fixed plant 12-40 years Vehicles, mobile plant and equipment 3-10 years Fixed assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill, if an appropriate trigger arises.
54 AWG Plc i Grants and contributions Grants and contributions for capital expenditure include government grants, infrastructure charges, sewer adoption fees and other contributions from third parties.
Other than those relating to infrastructure assets, they are credited to a deferral account within creditors and are released to the profit and loss account evenly over the expected useful life of the relevant asset, in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
Grants and contributions for capital expenditure on infrastructure assets are deducted from the costs of these assets.
This policy is not in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 4 of the Companies Act 1985, which requires grants and contributions to be shown as deferred income, but has been adopted in order to show a true and fair view, as in the opinion of the Directors, while a provision is made for depreciation of infrastructure assets, these assets have no determinable finite economic life and hence no basis exists on which to recognise such contributions as deferred income.
The financial effect of this departure is disclosed in note 14.
Revenue grants and contributions are credited to the profit and loss account in the year to which they apply.
In particular, commuted lump sums received in advance for water and sewer requisitions are credited to a deferral account within creditors and are released to the profit and loss account in proportion to the year to which they apply.
j Leased assets Where assets are financed by leasing arrangements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee finance leases, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and the corresponding capital cost is shown as an obligation to the lessor.
Leasing payments are treated as consisting of a capital element and finance costs, the capital element reducing the obligation to the lessor, and the finance costs being written off to the profit and loss account over the primary period of the lease.
The assets are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful economic lives and the lease period.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases.
Rental costs arising under operating leases are expensed over the term of the lease.
Equipment leased to customers under operating leases is capitalised in accordance with 1 h above.
Operating lease income is accounted for on a straight line basis with any rental increases recognised during the period to which they relate.
k Investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
l Stock and work in progress Stock is stated at cost less any provision necessary to recognise damage and obsolescence.
Work in progress, with the exception of long-term contract work in progress, is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes labour, materials, transport and attributable overheads.
Net realisable value is the estimated proceeds from the sale of stock less all further costs to be incurred.
m Long-term contracts Amounts recoverable on long-term contracts are stated at cost plus attributable profits less provision for any known or anticipated losses and payments on account and are included in debtors.
Payments on account in excess of amounts recoverable on long-term contracts are included in creditors.
n Pension costs Contributions to the groups defined benefit pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the regular cost of pensions over the average service lives of employees, in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
Actuarial surpluses and deficits are amortised, where appropriate, over the average remaining service lives of employees.
The cost of defined contribution schemes is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in respect of which the contributions become payable.
The notes to the accounts disclose the effect of the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
o Research and development Research and development expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
p Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange under the related forward currency contract.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, including the groups interest in the underlying net assets of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings, are translated into Sterling at the financial year end exchange rates.
Profits and losses of overseas subsidiaries and associates are translated into Sterling at average rates of exchange during the year.
Gains or losses arising on the translation of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries and associates are taken to reserves, together with exchange differences arising on related foreign currency hedge instruments to the extent these offset.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Annual Report and Accounts 2005 55 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued q Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided on timing differences, arising from the different treatment for accounts and taxation purposes of events and transactions recognised in the financial statements of the current and previous years.
Deferred taxation is calculated at the rates at which it is estimated that taxation will arise.
The deferred taxation balances are discounted using the post tax yields to maturity that could be obtained at the balance sheet date on government bonds with maturity dates similar to those of the deferred taxation assets and liabilities.
For assets with a life in excess of 30 years, the 30 year bond rate has been used as no other quoted rates are available.
Deferred taxation is not provided in respect of timing differences arising from the sale or revaluation of fixed assets unless, by the balance sheet date, a binding commitment to sell the asset has been entered into, and it is unlikely that any gain will be rolled over.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which the deferred tax asset can be recovered in future periods.
Calculation of deferred tax on infrastructure assets: Infrastructure assets effectively have an unlimited life and a notional depreciation charge, the infrastructure renewal charge, is applied to the network note 1 h tangible fixed assets and depreciation.
For the purposes of estimating the deferred tax liability in relation to infrastructure assets, the useful life over which the underlying differences reverse is estimated by deflating the current cost based infrastructure renewals charge to an appropriate deemed historic cost based depreciation charge.
r Financial instruments Derivative instruments are used for hedging purposes in line with the groups risk management policy and no trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
Loans and other borrowings are recorded using the contracted rates implicit in the financial instruments used to hedge the groups exposure to fluctuations in currency rates.
Similarly, interest is charged to the profit and loss account based on the contracted interest rates.
Issue costs are amortised at a constant rate over the life of the underlying instrument.
Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the groups exposure to movements in interest rates.
The interest payable or receivable on such swaps is accrued in the same way as interest arising on deposits or borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value prior to maturity.
Currency swaps are used to hedge foreign currency investments.
The future currency exchange within such contracts is revalued to the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and any unrealised gain or loss is matched with that underlying asset or liability in reserves.
The interest coupon on such swaps is accrued in the same way as that on borrowings and deposits.
s Provisions Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation for a past event, for which it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions of a long-term nature are discounted, where material, in relation to the estimated period over which the provision will be utilised.
The rate of discount reflects the time value of money and the risks associated with the liability.
Pension provisions are assessed in accordance with SSAP24 Accounting for Pension Costs, for both funded and unfunded obligations.
The unwinding of the discount on those provisions other than deferred tax is included within net interest payable.
t Bid and pre-contract costs Bid and pre-contract costs are written off as an expense until such time as the award of a contract becomes virtually certain.
u Closure costs Once irrevocable decisions have been made to close an operation, provisions are made to reflect the extent to which obligations, including redundancy costs, have been incurred that are not expected to be covered by future profits of the operation.
Provisions include only the direct costs of termination and any operating losses up to the date of the termination, after taking account of the aggregate profit, if any, to be recognised from the future profits of the operation.
v Redundancy costs Redundancy costs are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which the group both becomes irrevocably committed to incurring the costs and has raised a valid expectation with, and announced the main features of the programme to, affected employees or their representatives.
56 AWG Plc w Onerous lease costs Provision is made for the expected future costs of property and other leases to the extent that these costs are not expected to be of future benefit to the business, net of any recoveries from sub leases.
x Self insurance Some subsidiary companies self insure the risks where it is commercially prudent to do so.
Provision is made in respect of notified claims to the extent that it is probable that a cash settlement will arise.
In addition provision is made in the groups captive insurance company, Rutland Insurance Limited, for the expected cost of claims incurred but not reported.
The provision is determined from an actuarial assessment based on past experience.
y Bad and doubtful debts In Anglian Water the bad debt provision is calculated by applying expected recovery rates, based on actual historical cash collection performance, to the aged debt profile.
In the remaining subsidiary companies specific provisions are made for those debts on which recovery is regarded as doubtful.
z Employee benefit trusts Employee benefit trusts have been established which result in the cost of delivering shares in the group to employees, under the terms of the relevant share option or Save As You Earn scheme, being charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the remaining period of the relevant scheme.
This charge is determined by amortising the difference between the option price payable by the employee and the market value of the shares at the date of grant over the expected life of the option or scheme.
Accordingly, if share options are granted at market value or at an allowable discount through a Save As You Earn Scheme, no charge arises in the profit and loss account.

d All intersegmental trading originates from the United Kingdom.
e The joint venture results are within AWG Property, Support Services and Project Investments segments and are stated after exceptional items of nil 2004: 1.0 million.
The group share of joint venture net assets at 31 March 2005 was 3.0 million 2004: 1.7 million.
f The Infrastructure Management Business has been renamed Morrison.
The divisions within Morrison have been reorganised from 1 April 2004 as follows: i The former Government Services division, together with the former Utility Services division including Celtic Anglian Water Limited, and Purac Limited as noted below have been included in the new Support Services division and comparatives altered accordingly.
ii Purac Limited has been transferred from Construction Services into Support Services.
The comparative amounts have been adjusted accordingly and the effect of this was to reduce turnover in Construction by 48.0 million and increase the loss before interest and net operating assets by 1.1 million and 3.7 million respectively.
iii The results of Construction Services and Morrison Centre are stated after recharging bid costs of 1.0 million 2004: 0.9 million and 0.5 million 2004: nil respectively to the Project Investments segment.
iv Project Investments, previously part of the Government Services division, is now a separate division and comparative amounts have been amended accordingly.
v Celtic Anglian Water Limited has been transferred from International Services into the Support Services division of Morrison.
Accordingly, the comparative turnover, profit before interest and net operating assets of Support Services have been increased by 5.6 million, 1.2 million and 2.7 million respectively.
g The comparative amounts for International Services have been split between continuing and discontinued operations.
The comparative amounts for International Services continuing operations have been reduced to reflect the inclusion of Celtic Anglian Water Limited in Support Services as noted above.
h Developments and Commercial Services has been renamed AWG Property.

Of the exceptional operating items and goodwill amortisation in 2004, nil and 1.3 million respectively relate to discontinued operations.
Further details of the businesses classified as discontinued above can be found in note 16.
Included within other external charges is a fine of 0.1 million imposed by the Health and Safety Executive following two incidents, including a fatality, in 2001 during the construction of the Tay wastewater treatment plant.
Legal costs in respect of the litigation of the former directors and shareholders of Morrison amounted to 2.5 million 2004: 1.5 million included in exceptional operating costs.
Annual Report and Accounts 2005 61 Notes to the financial statements continued 4 Exceptional items 2005 2004 m m Restructuring and other costs 2.5 Asset impairments 17.7 Contract rectification costs 2.5 Charged against group operating profit 22.7 Loss on disposal and closure of businesses net : Profits on disposals and closures of businesses continuing 8.4 Losses on disposals and closures of businesses continuing 14.4 33.2 Losses on disposals of businesses discontinued 88.3 6.0 121.5 Charged against profit before interest 6.0 144.2 Tax credit thereon 0.7 4.2 Total exceptional items 5.3 140.0 The net loss on disposal of businesses in 2005 of 6.0 million relates to profits and losses on business closures and disposals of 8.4 million and 14.4 million respectively.
These are explained as follows: MVM, a non-core software development business within Morrison Support Services, was sold for proceeds of 12.9 million in cash.
This gave rise to an exceptional charge of 7.3 million including the write off of unamortised goodwill of 17.6 million.
In 2005 AWG continued to divest its international businesses which gave rise to an overall exceptional gain of 1.3 million.
This can be analysed as a net 0.8 million gain relating to business closures and disposals in China and a net 0.5 million gain relating to other business closures and disposals.
Within China there were further provisions relating to losses on business closures yet to be concluded of 5.0 million and an exceptional credit of 5.8 million predominantly associated with a release of prior year provisions on exiting another interest in China, following the disposal of the water treatment works in Taizhou in May 2005.
During the year businesses in New Zealand and South Africa were disposed of for total consideration of 6.0 million giving rise to an exceptional profit of 2.6 million.
This was offset by a 2.1 million provision relating to losses on business closures on which contracts for sale are awaiting either exchange of contracts or completion.
The exceptional items charged in 2004 were as follows: Restructuring and other costs of 2.5 million in 2004 related to expenditure on bid defence and Morrison litigation.
The impairment of 17.7 million in 2004 comprises 10.0 million in respect of development properties held in current assets and 7.7 million for current assets in the international business relating to the continuing businesses in Thailand, South Africa and Russia which have been written down to expected net realisable value.
Contract rectification costs of 2.5 million in 2004 are in respect of adjudication of a claim in relation to Rockingham Motor Speedway.
The loss on disposal and closure of continuing businesses of 33.2 million in 2004 related to the loss on disposal of Powermarque of 5.6 million, provision for loss on closure of international businesses of 22.5 million including goodwill previously eliminated against reserves of 6.1 million, disposal costs of 5.2 million and joint venture impairments of 1.0 million, and other termination costs of 5.1 million including closure costs of AWG Rail of 4.2 million.
The loss on disposal of discontinued businesses of 88.3 million in 2004 related to the international segment and is stated after deducting unamortised goodwill of 39.0 million, goodwill previously eliminated against reserves of 9.5 million and disposal costs of 10.6 million.

Movements in the discount rates gave rise to a charge of 2.0 million 2004: credit of 3.5 million in the year.
If all UK gilt rates moved by 0.25 per cent, the tax charge would move by between 10.0 million and 15.0 million.
Adjustments in respect of prior years arise from the agreement of open tax computations.
Due to a change in tax legislation, and based upon capital investment plans for Anglian Water for the current regulatory period, the group expects to be able to claim tax relief on capital expenditure in-line with depreciation for the current regulatory period.
This will lead to higher future tax payments compared to previous years.
Factors affecting tax charge credit for the year including exceptional items The tax assessed for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30 per cent.

The book values assigned to derivative instruments are separately analysed from the book value of the underlying loans in the table above.
The estimated fair values of quoted loans and other borrowings are based on period end mid-market quoted prices.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined by calculating with reference to market exchange and interest rates at 31 March the net realisable value that would have arisen if these contracts had terminated at 31 March.
Fair values of other loans and borrowings are estimated by reference to market prices where these are available.
The fair value of the groups cash, fixed asset investments, long-term debtors, provisions, redeemable shares, long-term creditors and accruals has been estimated as not materially different from book value.

The provision for unfunded pension obligations relates to the cost of enhancements to the pension entitlements of former employees, over and above their entitlements in the groups pension schemes.
The majority of these employees ceased their employment following redundancy programmes principally between four and 16 years ago.
These pension enhancements are payable until the death of the employees or their dependants, and payments are expected to be made over approximately 27 years.
The provision is determined using actuarial assumptions based on those used for the valuation of the groups pension scheme and has been discounted.
The onerous lease provision relates to the cost of leasehold properties not occupied by the group including two properties which were vacated following recent business closures and disposals.
The 1.0 million reanalysed represents an onerous lease provision previously provided for on disposal of a business but not separately analysed.
These provisions are discounted and are expected to be utilised over the next 18 years.
Business closure and disposal provisions were established at 31 March 2004 and relate to exit costs, principally in the International division, which are expected to crystallise over a period of approximately two years.
The contract and other provisions comprise potential warranty and certification costs of 9.1 million, which are expected to crystallise over a period of approximately three years and 3.9 million in respect of insurance claims against the group incurred but not reported, which are expected to be utilised over a period of approximately 10 years.
This provision has been made following an actuarial assessment of the obligation taking account of past claims experience.
The provision for joint venture liabilities represents the aggregate amount of net liabilities in joint ventures at the balance sheet date.
The amounts have been transferred from investments in order to separate the gross amounts of investments with net liabilities from those with net assets as prescribed in the accounting policy note 1 d. Movements in the groups share of joint venture assets and liabilities are disclosed in note 15.
The coupon enhancement provision of 21.6 million relates to coupon enhancement and other related costs incurred on the transfer of debt from AWG Group Limited to Anglian Water Services Financing Plc at the end of the refinancing exercise in 2002.
The provision relates to several instruments with varying maturity dates.
It is expected to be utilised at varying amounts over the next 24 years and has been discounted.
78 AWG Plc 24 Deferred taxation The total tax charge or credit in the current year includes discounted deferred taxation.
Consequently, changes in the medium and long-term interest rates used to discount deferred taxation assets and liabilities can affect the amount of deferred taxation charged or credited in the profit and loss account.
The groups deferred tax liability is stated net of Advanced Corporation Tax ACT recoverable.
If changes in the tax legislation were introduced which restricted the ability of companies to use ACT, this asset may no longer be recoverable and in this event an additional charge would arise in the profit and loss account of 69.1 million.

At the same time AWG Plc issued to shareholders 177,451 million redeemable shares, a return of capital to shareholders of 177.4 million.
On 21 June 2004 47,569 million redeemable shares were issued to ordinary shareholders.
In the prior year 77,481 million 4 August 2003: 57,494 million and 15 December 2003: 19,987 million redeemable shares were issued to ordinary shareholders.
The holders of the redeemable shares are entitled, in priority to any distribution to ordinary shareholders, to be paid a redeemable preferential dividend per share at a rate of 75 per cent of six month LIBOR, six monthly in arrears.
In the event of a winding up of the company, repayment is made to holders of these shares only of the nominal capital paid up.
The holders of the redeemable shares are not entitled to vote at any general meeting except if a resolution to wind up the company is considered.
Shareholders were given the opportunity by the company for these redeemable shares to be repurchased for cash.
As a result, 48,912 million 2004: 248,614 million redeemable shares were repurchased for cash at a nominal value of 0.1 pence, 48.9 million 2004: 248.6 million in value.
All of the shares repurchased by the company were cancelled.
On 31 March 2005, there were 14,749 million 2004: 16,092 million redeemable shares of 0.1 pence each still in issue.
During the year, 912,059 19.9 pence 2004: 260,666 19.9 pence ordinary shares were allotted with an aggregate nominal value of 0.2 million 2004: 0.1 million for total consideration of 4.1 million 2004: 1.4 million.

Annual Report and Accounts 2005 81 Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Pension commitments Pension arrangements for the majority of the groups UK employees are of the funded defined benefit type, principally through the AWG Pension Scheme AWGPS, the Morrison Pension and Life Assurance Plan MPLAP formerly AWG Infrastructure Management Pension Scheme AWGIMPS, the AWG Pensions and Life Assurance Plan AWGPLAP and various other smaller arrangements.
The groups actuaries are Aon Consulting.
The majority of defined benefit arrangements are closed to new members, who are eligible instead for entry to the groups defined contribution schemes.
For closed schemes, under the projected unit method, the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
A number of defined contribution schemes operate both in the UK and overseas, and contributions to these schemes in the year amounted to 4.3 million 2004: 3.4 million.
The administration and investment of the pension funds are maintained separately from the finances of the group.
The accounting for pension costs has been undertaken in accordance with SSAP 24, based on the most recent actuarial valuations.
Details of the most recent actuarial valuations of the pension schemes are summarised below.
The valuation as at 31 March 2005 is as yet unavailable from the groups actuaries and hence the most recent valuation used for the AWGPS and MPLAP schemes is 31 March 2002.

The net pension costs includes a credit of 1.5 million 2004: 1.5 million in respect of the amortisation of actuarial surpluses.
At 31 March 2005 there was a prepayment in respect of pensions of 86.2 million 2004: 58.0 million.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits In November 2000 the Accounting Standards Board issued FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The group is making use of the transitional arrangements regarding the adoption of FRS 17.
These disclosures are included below as if FRS 17 had been applied from 1 April 2001.
The valuation used for the FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuations, summarised above updated by independent actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 March 2005.
The group is contributing 20.1 per cent of pensionable pay plus 9.2 million per annum before indexation to the AWGPS and 13.2 per cent of pensionable pay to MPLAP and 20.3 per cent of pensionable pay to AWGPLAP.
The contributions to MPLAP include 1.4 per cent of pensionable pay to fund the shortfall in the Scheme over the average future working lifetimes of employees.
The group also manages an unfunded pension arrangement note 23, which has been valued by independent actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS17 as at 31 March 2005.
In addition, the group operates a number of other defined benefit schemes in the UK.
The assets and liabilities of these arrangements are not material to the group in the context of SSAP 24, or have been acquired in the current year, and were therefore excluded from the following disclosures in previous years.
In the current year these schemes have been included in aggregate as Other Schemes in the FRS 17 disclosures for completeness.
