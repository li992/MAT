The capital redemption reserve represents profits on the redemption of preference shares arising in prior years, together with the capitalisation of the nominal value of shares purchased and cancelled, net of the utilisation of this reserve to capitalise the nominal value of shares issued to satisfy scrip dividend elections.
The non-distributable reserve was created as a result of an inter-group reorganisation to create a more efficient capital structure that more accurately reflects the groups management structure.
During the year, 200.0m of the non-distributable reserve was realised following the receipt of qualifying consideration.
Accordingly, this amount has been transferred to retained earnings and is available for future dividend distributions.
