Carillion plc Section 07 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Financial Statements 86 Notes to the Company Financial Statements 1 Principal accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements, except in respect of the matters noted below.
Changes in accounting policies During the year the Company adopted FRS 17 Retirement benefits, FRS 20 Share-based payments, FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date, FRS 25 Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation, FRS 26 Financial instruments: measurement and FRS 28 Corresponding amounts.
The adoption of these standards represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
The effect of the change in accounting policy on adoption of FRS 21 was to recognise the final proposed dividend for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 10.1m in the current year.
The final proposed dividend for the current year of 14.6m will be recognised in the following year as it has yet to be approved.
The effect of the adoption of FRS 26 is to include on balance sheet the fair value of forward foreign currency contacts that previously were not required to be recognised.
As permitted by FRS 26, the Company has adopted its requirements prospectively from 1 January 2005.
The effect of the adoption of FRS 26 on net assets is nil at 1 January 2005 and a reduction of 0.2m at 31 December 2005.
The adoption of FRS 17, FRS 20, FRS 25 and FRS 28 has had no effect on net assets in either the current or preceding year.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and law.
Taxation Deferred tax assets or liabilities arise from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in the tax computation that have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Liabilities are calculated on a non-discounted full provision basis.
Assets are calculated on the same basis, but are recognised only to the extent that is it probable that they will be recovered.
Fixed asset investments In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are stated at cost, less provision for any impairment.
Leasing The Company enters into finance lease arrangements on behalf of subsidiary companies.
As permitted by SSAP 21 Accounting for leases and hire purchase contracts, the assets relating to the finance leases are included in the financial statements of the subsidiaries concerned.
The capital element of outstanding finance leases is included within borrowings.
The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the profit and loss account at a constant periodic rate of charge on the outstanding obligations.
Own shares Company shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP trust are presented within the profit and loss account reserve until such time as the interest in the shares is transferred unconditionally to the employees.
Costs of administering the trust are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
The ESOP trust is regarded as a quasi subsidiary under FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions and its assets, liabilities and results are consolidated into the financial statements of the Company.
Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling and recorded using the contracted exchange rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the relevant balance sheet date and the gains and losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Cash flow statement A cash flow statement has not been presented as permitted by FRS 1 revised Cash flow statements.
Section 07 Carillion plc Financial Statements Annual Report and Accounts 2005 87 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Share-based payments In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 Share-based payments has been applied to share options granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005.
Members of the Companys senior management team are entitled to participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
In addition, UK employees are able to participate in the Sharesave scheme.
The fair values of the ESOS and sharesave schemes at the date of grant are estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The fair value of the LTIP scheme is estimated using a bespoke model that factors in the probabilities of achieving Total Shareholder Return TSR performance conditions.
For all schemes the fair value determined at grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Financial instruments The Companys principal financial assets and liabilities are cash at bank and in hand and borrowings.
Cash at bank and in hand is carrried in the balance sheet at nominal value.
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
In addition, the Company enters into forward contracts in order to hedge against small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures.
Forward contracts are measured initially at fair value, with changes in fair value during the year recognised in the profit and loss account.
Fair values are based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Financial guarantee contracts Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtnesss of subsidiary companies, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Retirement benefit obligations Pension costs are recognised in the financial statements in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17.
Employees of the Company participate in the Carillion Staff and B schemes which provide pensions on a defined benefit basis.
The assets and liabilities of these schemes relating to the Company cannot be readily ascertained on a reasonable and consistent basis as the schemes are operated for the benefit of the Carillion Group as a whole.
Consequently, the Company accounts for these schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes.
Details of the Groups pension schemes are disclosed in note 31 of the consolidated financial statements.
