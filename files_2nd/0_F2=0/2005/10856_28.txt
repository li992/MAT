Notes to the Accounts 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The separate accounts of the parent company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
The accounts have been prepared under the historic cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
In applying these policies management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Change in accounting policies Post balance sheet events In accordance with FRS 21, Events after the Balance Sheet Date, the Company now recognises dividends in the period they are declared.
The prior year comparatives have been restated to comply with FRS 21 resulting in an increase in net assets and reserves of 28.5m at 31 December 2004, and an increase in retained profit for the year of 4.9m.
Net assets and reserves at 1 January 2004 have been increased by 23.6m.
Share-based payments In accordance with the transitional provisions in the standard, FRS 20, Share-based Payment, has been applied to all grants made after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
This has resulted in a reduction in operating profits in the prior year of 0.3m.
A related deferred tax asset of 1.0m has also been recognised at 31 December 2004, and has been credited to reserves.
Similarly a deferred tax asset of 0.2m has increased net assets and reserves at 1 January 2004.
Financial Instruments: Disclosure, Presentation and Measurement In accordance with the transitional provisions in the standards, FRS 25, Financial instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and FRS 26, Financial Instruments: Measurement, have been adopted from 1 January 2005.
Under the previous UK GAAP accounting policies, gains and losses from derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes were not recognised in earnings or as adjustments to carrying value until the underlying hedged transaction matured or occurred.
FRS 26 requires all derivatives to be fair valued in the balance sheet.
As a result, net assets and reserves have been restated by 17.3m at 1 January 2005.
Other standards The Company has adopted FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, in the year, although this has had no impact on the Company which treats both its pension schemes as defined contribution schemes see note 16.
The Company has also adopted FRS 23, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, which has also had no impact on reported results.
Leases Leases of tangible fixed assets where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Company, are classified as finance leases and are capitalised in the balance sheet as plant and equipment.
Finance leases are capitalised at the fair value of the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The capital element of future obligations under hire purchase contracts and finance leases is included as a liability in the balance sheet.
The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases of assets where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Incentives received under operating leases and initial direct costs in negotiating the lease are amortised to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of lease, or to the first review if shorter.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Plant and equipment 3 to 10 years The carrying value of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account during the financial period in which they are incurred.
112 Notes to the Accounts 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Investments in subsidiaries Investments are held at historic cost less any provision for impairment.
Available for sale investments Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such, or that are not classified in any of the other categories.
After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the income statement.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
Issue costs are amortised over the expected life of the instrument.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
From 1 January 2005 hedge accounting is adopted where derivatives such as fixed to floating interest rate swaps are held as fair value hedges against fixed interest rate borrowings.
Under fair value hedge accounting, fixed interest rate borrowings are revalued at each balance sheet date by the change in fair value attributable to the interest rate being hedged.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Where the Company expects a provision to be reimbursed the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when reimbursement is virtually certain.
Pensions The Company is part of a multi-employer scheme that also incorporates other companies within the National Express Group.
In line with FRS 17, the Company treats the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme and recognises charges as and when contributions are due to the scheme.
Share-based payments In accordance with the transition provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant including market based performance conditions.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using the stochastic model.
The fair value is then expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account is credited to reserves.
Non-market based performance related vesting conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value: instead the vesting period is based on the Companys estimate of when those performance features will be achieved and is revised if facts and circumstances change.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all material timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more likely than not in that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end except where forward cover has been arranged, in which case the forward rate is used.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the profit or loss account, with the exception of differences arising on the translation of foreign currency equity investments, and on foreign currency borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are used to finance or provide a hedge against these investments.
These are taken directly to reserves.
Derivative financial instruments The Company followed the transitional provisions of FRS 26, and has not restated comparative figures in accordance with either FRS 26 or FRS 25.
The accounting policy after 1 January 2005 is as follows: The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value for the reported balance sheet.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps is calculated by reference to market exchange rates and interest rates at the period end.
113 Notes to the Accounts 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Derivative financial instruments continued In relation to cash flow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity, and the ineffective portion in the profit and loss account.
The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are recycled through the profit and loss account in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Forward currency contracts are used to hedge our net investment in foreign currency denominated operations and to the extent they are designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in equity against changes in value of the related assets.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, gains or losses are taken directly to the profit and loss account in the period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that date any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, or transferred to the profit and loss account if the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur.
Prior to 1 January 2005 the accounting policy was: Interest rate and fuel swaps The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate exposures and fuel swaps to hedge the Groups fuel price exposures.
The Company considers that these derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting when certain criteria are met.
The Companys criteria for these swaps are that the instrument must be related to an asset, liability or future obligation and it must change the character of the interest rate or fuel price by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa.
These swaps are not revalued to fair value or included in the Company balance sheet at the period end.
Forward exchange contracts The rates under foreign currency contracts are used to record the hedged item and as such gains and losses on the related financial assets and liabilities.
Where the contract is a hedge against future transactions, gains and losses are deferred until the transaction occurs.
2 EXCHANGE RATES The most significant exchange rates to the pound for the Company are as follows: 2005 2005 2004 2004 Closing rate Average rate Closing rate Average rate US dollar 1.72 1.82 1.92 1.84 Canadian dollar 2.00 2.20 2.31 2.38 Euro 1.45 1.47 n a n a Australian dollar 2.35 2.39 2.45 2.48 The 2005 average rate for Euros reflects the average rate since the Alsa acquisition.

During the year ended 31 December 2005 the Company has repurchased 3,300,000 shares for consideration of 29.3m.
2,900,000 shares have been cancelled, and the remaining 400,000 shares retained as treasury shares within equity for future issue under the Companys various share schemes or cancellation.
Own shares comprise 849,456 2004: 1,743,544 ordinary shares in the Company that have been purchased by the Trustees of the National Express Employee Benefit Trust the Trust.
The shares are held to satisfy potential awards or options granted under a number of the Companys share schemes.
The value of shares within the Trust has been recognised as an investment in treasury shares.
The market value of these shares at 31 December 2005 was 7.3m 2004: 14.4m.
The dividends payable on these shares have been waived.
The 17.3m restatement of reserves following the recognition of financial instruments arises from the change in accounting policy on adopting FRS 26.
The profit attributable to shareholders of the parent company was 61.2m 2004: 50.8m.
The profit and loss reserve for the Company includes 12.2m 2004: 5.1m that is non-distributable on account of own shares held and the hedging reserve.
16 RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Company participates in both the National Express Group multi-employer funded defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the multi-employer scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis, and therefore has accounted for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme under the requirements of FRS 17.
Contributions to this scheme are determined by independent professionally qualified actuaries.
The details of the latest actuarial valuation are detailed in note 36 to the Group accounts.
The pension charge for the year amounted to 1.1m 2004: 0.9m.
17 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The charge in respect of share-based payment transactions included in the Companys profit and loss account for the year is as follows: 2005 2004 m m Expense arising from share and share option plans 0.8 0.3 Restated for change in accounting policy see note 1 During the year ended 31 December 2005, the Company had the following share based payment arrangements, which are described in note 7 to the Group accounts: Executive Share Option Plan Savings Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave Scheme Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Share Matching Plan SMP Deferred Annual Share Bonus Plan 120 Notes to the Accounts 17 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued For the following disclosure, share options with a nil exercise price have been disclosed separately to avoid distorting the weighted average exercise prices.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2005 had exercise prices that were between 398p and 1224p 2004: between 398p and 1224p excluding options with a nil exercise price.
Options were exercised throughout the year and the weighted average share price at exercise was 875p 2004: 654p.
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted during the year was calculated using a stochastic model, with the following assumptions and inputs: Share options without Share options with nil exercise price nil exercise price 2005 2004 2005 2004 Risk free interest rate 5.1% 4.8% 4.8% Expected volatility 28.0% 25.0%-27.0% 29.0% Expected option life in years 8 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividend yield 3.9% 3.3%-3.4% 3.9% Weighted average share price 697p 888p-906p 679p Weighted average exercise price 681p 0p 0p Weighted average fair value of options granted 149p 561p-821p 606p Experience to date has shown that approximately 15% 2004: 15% of options are exercised early, principally due to redundancies.
This has been incorporated into the calculation of the expected option life for the share options without nil exercise price.
Expected volatility in the table above was determined from historic volatility over the last eight years, adjusted for one-off events that were not considered to be reflective of the volatility of the share price going forward.
The expected dividend yield represents the dividends declared in the 12 months preceding the date of the grant divided by the average share price in the month preceding the date of the grant.
For share options granted during the year under the LTIP, the TSR targets have been reflected in the calculation of the fair value of the options above.
121 Notes to the Accounts 18 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating lease commitments The Company has entered into operating leases on certain properties.
