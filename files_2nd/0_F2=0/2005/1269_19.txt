The directors are required to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors confirm that suitable accounting policies have been used and applied consistently with the exception of the changes arising on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year as explained in the company accounting policies on page 81.
They also confirm that reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 and that applicable accounting standards have been followed.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the website Legislation in the UK concerning the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
