EBITDA is not a direct measure of our liquidity, which is shown by the Groups cash flow statement and needs to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
EBITDA may not be indicative of our historical operating results, nor is it meant to be predictive of our potential future results.
We believe that EBITDA is a measure commonly reported and widely used by investors in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortisation, which can vary significantly depending upon accounting methods particularly when acquisitions have occurred or non-operating factors.
Accordingly, EBITDA has been disclosed in this document to permit a more complete and comprehensive analysis of our operating performance relative to other companies and of our ability to service our debt.
Because all companies do not calculate EBITDA identically, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
EBITDA is one of the key measures that we use to assess our success in achieving growth and operational efficiencies.
See the reconciliation of Group operating profit to EBITDA in the Operating and Financial Review, and the reconciliation of operating profit to net cash inflow from operating activities in the note to the Cashflow Statement.
EBITDA comprises total Group operating profit before depreciation and amortisation, both being non-cash items.
Adjusted EBITDA excludes exceptional one-off items comprising 36.5 million of lawsuit costs associated with a Yellow Book advertising campaign in the year ended 31 March 2005: 90.1 million of expenses incurred in connection with our initial public offering in the year ended 31 March 2004: and 15.0 million of expenses incurred in connection with our decision not to proceed with the initial public offering and non-recurring restructuring charges of 3.7 million in the year ended 31 March 2003. b Capital expenditure represents cash expenditure on tangible fixed assets, net of sales proceeds.
c Effective 1 April 2002, the Group prospectively adopted SFAS 142 for US GAAP reporting purposes, which eliminated the requirement to amortise goodwill.
Adjusted net income loss presents the prior periods net income loss after eliminating the effect of goodwill amortisation from 1 April 1999.

Unique advertisers are counted once only, regardless of the number of advertisements they purchase or the number of directories in which they advertise.
b The proportion of unique advertisers that have renewed their advertising from the preceding publication.
As a result of improvements to our systems, we are now able to include national and key accounts in our measurement of retention.
If we had continued to exclude these accounts, the retention rate for the financial year ended 31 March 2005 would have been 74%.
We have not adjusted previously reported figures for the financial year ended 31 March 2004.
These improvements to our systems have not affected the reporting of our financial results.
c As a result of the progress in the US towards integrating our customer databases, we have been able to make improvements in the ways in which we capture, record and analyse customer information.
This has led to a significant overall elimination of duplicate records of unique advertisers.
We have not adjusted the previously reported figure for the financial year ended 31 March 2004 for any duplicated records in that period.
There remains some overlap in reporting unique advertisers between Yellow Book and acquired businesses that we expect to be removed.
Retention in the US is based on unique directory advertisers.
d Unique customers with a live contract at month end.
These figures refer to searchable advertisers only, i. e. advertisers for whom users can search on Yell.
They exclude advertisers who purchase products such as banners and domain names.
e Growth in page impressions is lower than in previous periods as a result of a site redesign that has reduced the number of pages a user has to access when searching Yell.
105 YELL GROUP PLC Notice of Annual General Meeting Notice is hereby given that the 2005 Annual General Meeting of Yell Group plc the Company will be held at the Plaisterers Hall, No.

It is a requirement of law that the final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2005 be approved by the shareholders of the Company.
The amount to be declared as a final dividend may not exceed the amount recommended by the directors.
Resolution 3 That the report on the remuneration of directors for the year ended 31 March 2005 be approved.
The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require companies to include certain specified information on the remuneration of their directors for each financial year in a report and to give their shareholders an opportunity to approve such report.
The report on the remuneration of the directors of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2005 may be found in the Annual Report of the Company starting at page 32.

Resolution 7 That Lord Powell of Bayswater be re-elected as a director.
Resolution 8 That Bob Scott be re-elected as a director.
Resolution 9 That Charles Carey be re-elected as a director.
Resolution 10 That John Coghlan be re-elected as a director.
Resolution 11 That Joachim Eberhardt be re-elected as a director.
As a matter of best practice, all of the current directors of the Company believe that they should retire and submit themselves for re-election at the 2005 Annual General Meeting.
Biographical details of all of the directors of the Company may be found in the Annual Report of the Company on page 42.
106 ANNUAL REPORT 2004 05 Resolution 12 That  LLP be reappointed auditors of the Company to hold office until the conclusion of the next general meeting of the Company before which accounts are laid.
The auditors are responsible for examining the annual accounts of the Company and forming an opinion as to whether they give a true and fair view of its results and financial position.
It is a requirement of law that the Company appoint auditors at each meeting at which accounts are presented to its shareholders, such appointment to continue until the next meeting at which accounts are presented.
Resolution 13 That the directors be authorised to determine the remuneration of the auditors.
This resolution gives the directors of the Company the authority to determine the remuneration of the auditors for the audit work to be carried out by them in the next financial year.
The amount of the remuneration paid to the auditors for the next financial year will be disclosed in the next audited accounts of the Company.
Resolution 14 That the directors be generally and unconditionally authorised under Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 to allot relevant securities as defined in that Act up to an aggregate nominal amount of 2,344,386.
This authority will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting or, if earlier, 15 months from the date of this resolution.
However, before this authority expires, the Company may make an offer or agreement which would or might require relevant securities to be allotted after the authority expires and the directors may allot relevant securities under any such offer or agreement as if the authority had not expired.
Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 provides that the directors of a company cannot issue new shares in its capital without the approval of its shareholders.
Accordingly, the purpose of this resolution is to give the directors of the Company authority to issue new shares in the capital of the Company up to a maximum amount of 2,344,386 which is approximately equivalent to 33.3 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 19 May 2005.
This resolution will allow the directors of the Company flexibility to act in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders by issuing new shares in appropriate circumstances.
Resolution 15 That the Company, and each of Yell Limited and Yellow Pages Sales Limited wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, be authorised to: a make donations to EU political organisations b incur EU political expenditure in an aggregate amount not exceeding 100,000 during the period ending on the date of the next Annual General Meeting.
For the purpose of this resolution 15, the phrases donations, EU political organisations and EU political expenditure shall have the meanings set out in Part XA of the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.
The Companies Act 1985 now includes provisions which require companies to obtain authority from their shareholders before they can make donations to EU political organisations or incur EU political expenditure.
The definitions of donations and EU political expenditure are very broad and, as a result, may cover activities which form part of the normal non-partisan relationships between companies and the political world, even though these activities are not designed to support a particular political party or to influence support for any political party, and would not be thought as political donations in the ordinary sense of the word.
The Company does not, directly or through any of its subsidiaries, make donations to any political parties and the Company does not have any intention of doing so in the future.
However, operating as we do in a regulated environment, we have a business need to maintain contact with politicians and political parties within the EU to make them aware of key issues affecting the Company and its subsidiaries, and the industry in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate.
This can involve, for example, involvement in seminars and functions to which politicians may be invited and sponsoring meetings at political parties conferences.
Accordingly, in common with other companies, the Company is seeking the approval of its shareholders, on a precautionary basis so as to avoid contravening the Companies Act 1985, to incur a level of expenditure to cover all of these activities.
107 YELL GROUP PLC Special Resolutions Resolution 16 That, provided resolution 14 has been passed, the directors be authorised under section 95 of the Companies Act 1985 to allot equity securities as defined in that Act for cash pursuant to the authority conferred on them by resolution 14, or where such allotment constitutes the allotment of equity securities by virtue of section 94 3A of that Act, as if section 89 1 of that Act did not apply to any such allotment.
This authority is limited to: a allotments connected to a rights issue to holders of ordinary shares in the Company excluding any ordinary shares held by the Company as treasury shares where the rights of each such holder are, as nearly as may be, proportionate to the number of ordinary shares held by such holder.
The directors may exclude certain shareholders, deal with fractions and generally manage the rights issue as they think fit b the allotment other than pursuant to sub-paragraph a above of equity securities up to an aggregate nominal value of 352,009 This authority will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting or, if earlier, 15 months from the date of this resolution.
However, before this authority expires, the Company may make an offer or agreement which would or might require equity securities to be allotted after the authority expires and the directors may allot securities under any such offer or agreement as if the authority had not expired.
Section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 gives existing shareholders in a company certain pre-emption rights with respect to allotments of new shares.
A company can only disapply these rights with the approval of its shareholders.
Accordingly, the purpose of this resolution is to allow the directors of the Company to allot ordinary shares in the Company for cash, or to transfer treasury shares for cash, other than to its existing shareholders on a pre-emptive basis up to a maximum amount of 352,009 which is equivalent to 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 19 May 2005 and is in line with the recommended guidelines issued by institutional investor bodies.
108 ANNUAL REPORT 2004 05 Resolution 17 That, pursuant to Article 20 of its Articles of Association, the Company be generally and unconditionally authorised to purchase its own fully-paid ordinary shares in the Company by way of market purchases within the meaning of section 163 3 of the Companies Act 1985 provided that: a the maximum number of ordinary shares in the Company that the Company may purchase is 70,401,979 b the minimum price that the Company may pay for an ordinary share in the Company is 1.00 pence c the maximum price which the Company may pay for an ordinary share in the Company is an amount equivalent to 105% of the middle market price for an ordinary share in the Company as set out in the Daily Official List published by London Stock Exchange for the five business days immediately before the day on which the Company agrees to purchase ordinary shares in the Company d this authority will expire at the conclusion of the next AGM or, if earlier, 15 months from the date of this resolution.
However, before this authority expires, the Company may agree to purchase ordinary shares in the Company where the purchase will or may be completed, either fully or partly, after the authority expires and the Company may purchase such ordinary shares as if the authority had not expired The directors consider, in certain circumstances, that it may be appropriate and in the best interest of shareholders generally for the Company to purchase its own shares.
This resolution gives authority for the Company to purchase up to 70,401,979 ordinary shares which is approximately equivalent to 10 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company as at 19 May 2005.
The directors have no specific plans to exercise any authority granted by this resolution in the future, but will keep the matter under review and will only make purchases where, in the light of prevailing market conditions, they consider it will result in an increase in earnings per ordinary share in the Company.
The total number of options to subscribe for ordinary shares in the Company outstanding as at 19 May 2005 was 19,674,679.
This represents 2.79 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company at that date.
If the Company were to buy back the maximum number of shares permitted pursuant to the passing of this resolution and cancel them, then the total number of options to subscribe for shares in the Company outstanding as at 19 May 2005 would represent 3.10 per cent of the reduced issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
The Companies Acquisition of Own Shares Treasury Shares Regulations 2003 which came into force on 1 December 2003 enable companies to retain any of their own shares they have purchased as treasury shares with a view to their possible re-issue at a later date, rather than cancelling them as the law previously required.
The Company will consider holding any of its own shares that it purchases pursuant to this resolution as treasury shares, which will give the directors flexibility in the management of the capital base of the Company.
No dividends will be paid on treasury shares while held in treasury, and no voting rights will attach to them.
109 YELL GROUP PLC Attendance at AGM and voting Only holders of ordinary shares in the Company on the Register of Members of the Company at 11am on 10 July 2005 are entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting.
