Accounting policies Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU at 31 December 2005, and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 that remain applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, for the first time.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards are provided in note 38.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of certain items which are measured at fair value, as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
Transitional arrangements The accounting policies have been applied to all periods presented except for those relating to the recognition, measurement, disclosure and presentation of financial instruments, all matters dealt with IAS 32 and IAS 39.
The group has taken an exemption to apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005.
Prior to this date, financial instruments have been accounted for under UK GAAP.
A reconciliation of equity on adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 at 1 January 2005 is provided in note 38.
In addition, the group has taken the following optional exemptions contained in IFRS 1 in preparing the groups balance sheet on transition to IFRS at 1 January 2004: Business combinations IFRS 3 Business Combinations has been applied prospectively from 1 January 2004.
Cumulative translation differences the cumulative translation differences for all operations have been set to zero at 1 January 2004 and exchange differences arising prior to this date will not be recycled to the income statement.
The groups policy for share-based payments has been applied to equity instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002 and that had not vested on or before 31 December 2004.
Adoption of new or revised standards prior to their effective date The group has adopted the amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits issued on 16 December 2004 prior to their effective date of 1 January 2006.
The amendments permit the group to recognise actuarial gains and losses in full through the statement of recognised income and expense, and expands the disclosures required in respect of the groups defined benefit pension schemes.
The group has adopted the amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement issued on 16 June 2005 prior to their effective date of 1 January 2006.
The amendments permit the group to designate a financial instrument with one or more embedded derivatives as a financial asset or financial liability at fair value through profit or loss, with certain exceptions.
The group has adopted the amendment early and has designated the 2.875 per cent 2008 convertible bonds at fair value through profit or loss with effect from 1 January 2005.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include those of LogicaCMG plc the company and all of its subsidiary undertakings together, the group, and the groups share of the results of associates and joint ventures.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled directly or indirectly by the company.
Control arises when the company has the ability to direct the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are included in the consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal respectively, using the same accounting policies as those of the group.
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
On acquisition, the interest of any minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair value of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, the minority interest in the consolidated balance sheet reflects the minoritys proportion of changes in the net assets of the subsidiary.
A minority interest is not recognised in a subsidiary with net liabilities except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation, and is able to make an additional investment, to cover cumulative losses.
All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale in the balance sheet if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than ongoing use but only if the sale is highly probable and is expected to complete within one year from the date of classification.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The results of an operation that represents a separate major line of business and either has been disposed of during the period or is classified as held for sale, are classified as discontinued operations.
The post-tax profit or loss of the discontinued operation plus the posttax gain or loss recognised on the measurement of the assets and liabilities within the disposal group at fair value less costs to sell, is presented as a single amount on the face of the income statement.
P44 Consolidated financial statements LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2005 1.
Accounting policies continued Intangible assets All intangible assets, except goodwill, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised and is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the groups interest in the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination.
Goodwill previously written off directly to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1 July 1998 has not been reinstated and is not recycled to the income statement on the disposal of the business to which it relates.
Development costs Expenditure incurred in the development of software products or enhancements, and their related intellectual property rights, is capitalised as an intangible asset only when the future economic benefits expected to arise are deemed probable and the costs can be reliably measured.
Development costs not meeting these criteria, and all research costs, are expensed in the income statement as incurred.
Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic lives once the related software product or enhancement is available for use.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets purchased separately, such as software licences that do not form an integral part of related hardware, are capitalised at cost and amortised over their useful economic life.
Intangible assets acquired through a business combination are initially measured at fair value and amortised over their useful economic lives.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into use.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write down the assets to their estimated residual value over their useful economic lives at the following rates: Furniture 10 20% Computer equipment 25 33% Partitions and office equipment 10 20% Motor vehicles 25% Freehold property 2% Leasehold equipment and plant Life of lease The residual values and useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually.
Freehold land and properties under construction are not depreciated.
Borrowing costs related to the purchase of fixed assets are not capitalised.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as property, plant and equipment at an amount equal to the fair value of the leased assets or, if lower, the present value of minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease, and then depreciated over their useful economic lives.
Lease payments are apportioned between repayment of capital and interest.
The capital element of future lease payments is included in the balance sheet as a liability.
Interest is charged to the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Operating lease incentives are recognised as a reduction in the rental expense over the lease term.
Impairment of assets Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purposes of impairment testing.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates is tested annually for impairment or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment, investments measured using a cost basis and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment only when events indicate the carrying value may be impaired.
In an impairment test, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit or asset is estimated to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use to the group.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount.
In determining a cash-generating units or assets value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the cash-generating unit or asset that have not already been included in the estimate of future cash flows.
LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2005 Consolidated financial statements P45 1.
Accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories represent computer equipment that, at the balance sheet date, had not yet been allocated to a specific customer contract and materials, including work-in-progress, used in document printing and finishing.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs to be incurred in marketing, distribution and sale.
Amounts recoverable on contracts Amounts recoverable on contracts represent revenue which has not yet been invoiced to customers on fixed price contracts.
Such amounts are separately disclosed within trade and other receivables.
The valuation of amounts recoverable on contracts is adjusted to take up profit to date or foreseeable losses in accordance with the groups accounting policy for profit recognition.
Financial instruments The following policies for financial instruments have been applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
For those policies that have changed on adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 1 January 2005, policies both before and after adoption are given.
Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of preparation of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, and short-term deposits with an original maturity period of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are an integral part of a subsidiarys cash management are included in cash and cash equivalents where they have a legal right of set-off against positive cash balances, otherwise bank overdrafts are classified as borrowings.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at amounts receivable less any provision for recoverability.
A trade or other receivable is derecognised from the balance sheet when the group enters into a financing transaction which transfers to a third party all significant rights or other access to benefits relating to that asset, and all significant exposures to the risks inherent in that asset.
Non-recourse financing 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2004 For non-recourse financing arrangements that did not meet the criteria for financial asset derecognition, a linked presentation has been adopted where criteria, set out in the UK accounting standard FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions, were met.
Under a linked presentation, the financing was shown as a deduction from the gross amount of the financial asset to which it related either on the face of the balance sheet or, if not material to the balance sheet, in the notes to the financial statements.
Non-recourse financing 1 January 2005 onwards A linked presentation is not permissible under IAS 32 and IAS 39. Financing of trade or other receivables shown under a linked presentation prior to 1 January 2005 have been treated as borrowings on and after that date.
Borrowings 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2004 Borrowings, including convertible debt, were recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
The finance costs of debt were allocated to financial periods and charged to the income statement over the term of the borrowings at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Accrued finance costs were included in accruals rather than in the carrying amount of the borrowing to the extent that they were due to be paid in cash within one year.
Conversion of debt was not anticipated and the finance cost of convertible debt was calculated on the basis that the debt would never be converted.
The carrying value of convertible debt was stated separately from that of other borrowings on the face of the balance sheet.
Borrowings 1 January 2005 onwards Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated either at amortised cost or, if designated as such, at fair value through profit or loss.
For borrowings stated at amortised cost, any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
The groups euro-denominated convertible bonds have been designated as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss.
The change in the fair value of the convertible bonds that reflects the movement in the quoted market price of the convertible bonds is recognised in the income statement as either interest income or expense.
The change in fair value relating to the movement of the exchange rate between the euro and pounds sterling is treated as a hedge of net investments in foreign operations see below.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on the convertible bonds are taken directly to equity to the extent that the hedge is effective.
P46 Consolidated financial statements LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2005 1.
Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2004 The group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The group considered these financial instruments to be hedges when the following criteria were met: the financial instruments must have been related to a specific foreign currency asset or liability that is probable and whose characteristics have been identified: it must have involved the same currency as the hedged item: and it must have reduced foreign currency risk on the groups operations.
Gains and losses on hedges of existing assets and liabilities were included in the carrying amount of those assets or liabilities and recognised in the income statement.
Gains and losses on qualifying hedges or firm commitments or anticipated transactions were classified as deferred and recognised in the income statement or as adjustments in the carrying amount of the transaction when it occurred.
Gains and losses on financial instruments that did not qualify as hedges were recognised as other income or expense.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 1 January 2005 onwards Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
The fair values of derivatives are measured using observable market prices or, where market prices are not available, by using discounted expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and exchange rates.
The gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to the income statement except where the derivative is part of a designated cash flow hedge or a designated hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction are recognised directly in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the measurement of the asset or liability at the time the asset or liability is recognised.
For cash flow hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period as the underlying transaction occurs.
Where the group hedges net investments in foreign entities through currency borrowings or derivative financial instruments, the gains or losses on the translation of the borrowings or change in fair value of the derivative are recognised in equity.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are not designated as a hedging instrument or do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Taxation Current tax is recognised based on the amounts expected to be paid or recovered under the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences that arise between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their corresponding tax bases.
Liabilities are recorded on all temporary differences except in respect of investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that it will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be offset.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in the income statement, except when the tax relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with directly in equity.
Provisions Provisions are recognised for restructuring costs when the group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected employees.
Provisions are recognised for future committed property lease payments when the group receives no benefit from the property through continuing usage and future receipts from any sub-letting arrangements are not in excess of the groups future committed payments.
Where the time value of money is material, provisions are measured at the present value of expenditures expected to be paid in settlement.
LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2005 Consolidated financial statements P47 1.
Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies The presentation currency of the group is pounds sterling.
The group also presents primary statements in euros, see pages 101 to 103.
Items included in the separate financial statements of group entities are measured in the functional currency of each entity.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the entity at the rates prevailing at the dates of the individual transactions.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses arising are charged or credited to the income statement within net operating costs.
The income statement and balance sheet of foreign entities are translated into pounds sterling on consolidation at the average rates for the period and the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date respectively.
Exchange gains and losses arising on the translation of the groups net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised as a separate component of shareholders equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income statement and recognised as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The most important foreign currency for the group is the euro.
The relevant exchange rates to pounds sterling were: 2005 2004 Average Closing Average Closing 1 1.46 1.46 1.47 1.41 Government grants Grants related to assets are recognised initially as deferred income and subsequently credited to the income statement on the same basis that the related assets are depreciated.
Grants related to income are credited to the income statement over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate.
Revenue and profit recognition Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received or receivable from clients for goods and services provided by the group, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Where the time value of money is material, revenue is recognised as the present value of the cash inflows expected to be received from the customer in settlement.
Revenue from the sale of software products or hardware with no significant service obligation is recognised 100 per cent on delivery.
Revenue from the sale of software products or hardware requiring significant modification, integration or customisation is recognised using the percentage of completion method.
The revenue and profit of contracts for the supply of professional services at predetermined rates is recognised as and when the work is performed, irrespective of the duration of the contract.
The revenue and profit of fixed price contracts is recognised on a percentage of completion basis when the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably.
A contracts outcome is usually deemed to be capable of reliable estimation at the earlier of six months from contract commencement and the date at which 50 per cent of the total estimated costs of professional services have been incurred.
If a contract outcome cannot be estimated reliably, revenues are recognised equal to costs incurred, to the extent that costs are expected to be recovered.
The stage of contract completion is usually determined by reference to the cost of professional services incurred to date as a proportion of the total estimated cost of professional services.
Provision is made for all foreseeable future losses.
Segment reporting At 31 December 2005, LogicaCMG is organised into two business segments: IT services and telecoms products.
The telecoms products business segment was previously referred to as the wireless networks business segment.
These two business segments are the groups primary reporting format for segment information as they represent the dominant source and nature of the groups risks and returns.
The groups secondary reporting format is by geographical area.
Inter-segment sales are charged at arms length prices.
Segment assets include all intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, inventories, trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents but exclude tax assets.
Segment liabilities comprise mainly trade and other payables, retirement benefit obligations and certain borrowings that can be attributed to the segment but exclude tax liabilities and borrowings that are for general corporate purposes.
Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.
P48 Consolidated financial statements LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2005 1.
Accounting policies continued Employee benefits Retirement benefits The group operates retirement benefit plans of both a defined contribution and defined benefit nature.
Retirement benefit plans that are funded by the payment of insurance premiums are treated as defined contribution plans unless the group has an obligation either to pay the benefits directly when they fall due or to pay further amounts if assets accumulated with the insurer do not cover all future employee benefits.
In such circumstances, the plan is treated as a defined benefit plan.
The cost of defined contribution plans is charged to the income statement on the basis of contributions payable by the group during the year.
For defined benefit plans, the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The retirement benefit liability in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as reduced by the fair value of plan assets and unrecognised past service cost.
A retirement benefit asset is recognised to the extent that the group can benefit from refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
Insurance policies are treated as plan assets of a defined benefit plan if the proceeds of the policy: can only be used to fund employee benefits: are not available to the groups creditors: and either cannot be paid to the group unless the proceeds represent surplus assets not needed to meet all the benefit obligations or are a reimbursement for benefits already paid by the group.
Insurance policies that do not meet the above criteria are treated as non-current investments and are held at fair value in the balance sheet.
The current service cost is recognised in the income statement as an employee benefit expense.
The interest cost, resulting from the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation over time and the expected return on plan assets, is recognised as net interest expense or income.
The expected return on plan assets is, for UK defined benefit pension schemes, shown net of an expected reduction for payments to the Pension Protection Fund the PPF levy.
The difference between the actual and expected PPF levy is treated as an actuarial gain or loss.
A past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that benefits are already vested, or is otherwise amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments or changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they arise.
Share-based payment The cost of share-based employee compensation arrangements, whereby employees receive remuneration in the form of shares or share options, is recognised as an employee benefit expense in the income statement.
The total expense to be apportioned over the vesting period of the benefit is determined by reference to the fair value at the grant date of the shares or share options awarded and the number that are expected to vest.
The assumptions underlying the number of awards expected to vest are subsequently adjusted to reflect conditions prevailing at the balance sheet date.
At the vesting date of an award, the cumulative expense is adjusted to take account of the awards that actually vest.
Short-term compensated absences A liability for short-term compensated absences, such as holiday, is recognised for the amount the group may be required to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the balance sheet date.
Death-in-service benefits Insured death-in-service benefits are accounted for as defined contribution arrangements.
Death-in-service benefits for which the group does not have insurance cover are accounted for as defined benefit arrangements.
Employee share ownership trusts Employee share ownership plan ESOP trusts, which purchase and hold ordinary shares of the company in connection with certain employee share schemes, are consolidated in the group financial statements.
Any consideration paid or received by ESOP trusts for the purchase or sale of the companys own shares is shown as a movement in shareholders equity.
Dividends Dividends to the companys shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders equity in the period in which the shareholders right to receive payment is established.

The group has adopted early certain amendments to existing standards, details of which are provided in note 1.
The directors anticipate that the future adoption of those standards, interpretations and amendments listed above that have not been adopted early will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements, with the possible exception of IFRIC 4.
IFRIC 4 contains guidance for determining whether arrangements are, or contain, leases that should be accounted for in accordance with IAS 17 Leases.
The effective date of IFRIC 4 is for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006.
The directors are considering the applicability of IFRIC 4 to the groups outsourcing arrangements but the impact that adoption of this interpretation will have is not yet known with certainty.
Key areas of estimation uncertainty In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management has to make judgements on how to apply the groups accounting policies and make estimates about the future.
The critical judgements that have been made in arriving at the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements and the key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the next financial year, are discussed below.
Revenue and profit recognition The revenue and profit of fixed price contracts is recognised on a percentage of completion basis when the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably.
Management exercises judgement in determining whether a contracts outcome can be estimated reliably.
Management also makes estimates of the total cost of professional services, or in some instances total contract costs, which are used in determining the value of amounts recoverable on contracts.
Estimates are continually revised based on changes in the facts relating to each contract.
The carrying amount of amounts recoverable on contracts is disclosed in note 20.
Impairment of goodwill The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the cash-generating units, including managements estimates of long-term operating margins and long-term growth rates.
The carrying amount of goodwill and the key assumptions used in the calculation of value in use of CGUs to which goodwill is attributed are disclosed in note 15.
Defined benefit plans The calculation of the defined benefit obligation of a defined benefit plan requires estimation of future events, for example salary and pension increases, inflation and mortality rates.
In the event that future experience does not bear out the estimates made in previous years, an adjustment will be made to the plans defined benefit obligation in future periods which could have a material effect on the group.
The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities relating to defined benefit plans, together with the key assumptions used in the calculation of the defined benefit obligations relating to those plans are disclosed in note 33.
Income taxes In recognising income tax assets and liabilities, management makes estimates of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain.
Where the final outcome of such matters is different, or expected to be different, from previous assessments made by management, a change to the carrying value of income tax assets and liabilities will be recorded in the period in which such a determination is made.
The carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities are disclosed separately in the consolidated balance sheet.

The basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to the discontinued operation for the year ended 31 December 2004 was a loss of 1.2 pence per share.
On 19 September 2005, the group announced a rights issue to part fund the proposed acquisition of Unilog.
Following the approval of the required resolutions at the subsequent Extraordinary General Meeting, 375,495,147 new ordinary shares of 10 pence each were issued at 107 pence per share on the basis of 1 new ordinary share for every 2 existing ordinary shares held.
The cum-rights price at the close of trading on 13 October 2005, the last day of trading before the shares were designated ex-rights, was 168 pence per share.
The theoretical ex-rights price for an ordinary share was approximately 147.7 pence per share.
The weighted average number of shares has been adjusted for the bonus element within the rights issue for all periods presented.
Earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2004 has been restated accordingly.
Adjusted earnings per share, both basic and diluted, have been shown as the directors consider this to be helpful for a better understanding of the performance of the groups underlying business.
The earnings measure used in adjusted earnings per share excludes, whenever such items occur: the results of discontinued operations: exceptional items: mark-to-market gains or losses on financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss: and amortisation of intangible assets initially recognised at fair value in a business combination.
All items adjusted are net of tax where applicable.
The weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by employee share ownership plan ESOP trusts, which are treated as cancelled.
The convertible bonds were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2004 as they were anti-dilutive, however, the convertible bonds are dilutive for the purposes of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2005.
The impact of the charge for share-based payments was to reduce adjusted basic earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2005 by 0.7 pence per share 2004: 0.7 pence per share.

A. see note 31, and a 9.5 per cent increase in stake in Nord IT GmbH, a subsidiary undertaking incorporated in Germany.
Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to one or more cash-generating units CGUs.
For the IT services business segment, CGUs represent the operations of a country or, in more material operations, divisions within a country.
For the telecoms products business segment, CGUs represent a product area.
The following table shows the allocation of the carrying value of goodwill at the balance sheet date by business segment and, for the IT services business segment, by geographic area.
2005 2004 m m IT services United Kingdom 167.6 167.6 Netherlands 14.9 15.4 Germany 59.8 60.1 France 10.2 10.2 Iberia 23.9 Rest of Europe 13.9 13.8 Rest of World 61.1 58.2 351.4 325.3 Telecoms products 32.0 32.0 383.4 357.3 The group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash flows.
In all cases, the approved budget for the following financial year formed the basis for the cash flow projections for a CGU.
The approved cash flow projections in the four financial years following the budget year reflected managements expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reflects market assessment of the time value of money at the balance sheet date and the risks specific to the CGU.
The discount rate applied to CGUs were in the range of 10.0 per cent 2004: 10.3 per cent to 15.6 per cent 2004: 14.7 per cent.
The weighted average discount rate applied to CGUs in the United Kingdom IT services business was 12.7 per cent 2004: 13.8 per cent.
The long-term operating margin assumed for a CGU's operations is primarily based on past performance.
For some CGUs, those for which management has strong reason to believe that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins, expected future improvements from sustainable operating cost savings are also included in managements assessment of the long-term operating margin.
The long-term operating margin applied to CGUs were in the range of 5.0 per cent 2004: 5.0 per cent to 10.0 per cent 2004: 14.7 per cent.
The weighted average long-term operating margin applied to CGUs in the United Kingdom IT services business was 10.0 per cent 2004: 11.8 per cent.
Long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed equal to the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the country in which the CGUs operations are undertaken, and were in the range of 1.1 per cent 2004: 0.8 per cent to 4.8 per cent 2004: 4.7 per cent.
The long-term growth rate of net operating cash flows assumed for CGUs in the United Kingdom IT services business was 2.5 per cent 2004: 2.4 per cent.
At 31 December 2004, goodwill relating to the IT services business in Germany was allocated separately to either one of two CGUs, the smaller of which represented the operations of Nord IT GmbH and the larger of which represented all other IT services operations in Germany.
Goodwill impairment tests were conducted separately for each CGU.
In 2005, following the increase in stake in Nord IT GmbH, goodwill relating to the IT services business in Germany was combined, with a single impairment test performed for the group of CGUs as a whole.
This reflected the way management run the German business.
LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2005 Consolidated financial statements P59 15.
Goodwill continued At 31 December 2005, the amount by which the value in use of the group of CGUs that represented the IT services business in Germany exceeded the carrying amount of the group of CGUs was 7.9 million.
If the key assumptions used to calculate the value were to change by the following amounts, with all other assumptions held constant, then the value in use would equal the carrying amount of the group of CGUs at 31 December 2005: if the pre-tax discount rate were to increase from 11.7 per cent to 12.4 per cent: or if the long-term operating margin were to decrease from 6.6 per cent to 6.0 per cent: or if the long-term growth rate of net operating cash flows were to decrease from 2.1 per cent to 1.3 per cent.
At 31 December 2004, the amount by which the value of the CGU that represented the IT services business in Germany excluding Nord IT GmbH exceeded the carrying amount of the CGU was 2.8 million.
If the key assumptions used to calculate the value in use of the CGU were to change by the following amounts, with all other assumptions held constant, then the value in use would equal the carrying amount of the CGU at 31 December 2004: if the pre-tax discount rate were to increase from 13.7 per cent to 14.1 per cent: or if the long-term operating margin were to decrease from 7.0 per cent to 6.7 per cent: or if the long-term growth rate of net operating cash flows were to decrease from 2.1 per cent to 1.6 per cent.

Investments continued A block trade purchase of a 32.3 per cent economic interest in the ordinary shares of Unilog was made from certain members of its senior management on 25 October 2005 for the issue of 19,572,703 new ordinary shares of 10 pence each in LogicaCMG plc, the fair value of which was 143.5p per share, and cash consideration of 172.5 million.
This transaction was followed by subsequent market purchases during November and December 2005, increasing the groups economic interest by 14.5 per cent for an additional cost of 91.8 million.
The total cost of investment of 301.5 million included 9.1 million of attributable transaction expenses and losses on cash flow hedges.
Due to the existence of shares with double voting rights not held by the group, the groups economic interest in Unilog of 46.8 per cent equated to ownership of 39.9 per cent of the voting rights.
On 13 January 2006, the group acquired a controlling interest in Unilog following the results of a public tender offer.
Further information is disclosed in note 37.
The interest in Unilog has been accounted for under the equity method in accordance with the groups accounting policy for associates.
At 31 December 2005, Unilog was a publicly traded company on Euronext Paris.
The fair value of the groups investment in Unilog was 296.4 million based on the mid-market price on 31 December 2005 and the closing exchange rate of 1.46 to 1.

On 1 January 2005, upon adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, amounts subject to non-recourse financing were reclassified as borrowings.
The groups credit risk on trade and other receivables is primarily attributable to trade debtors and amounts recoverable on contracts.
The amounts presented in the table above are net of allowances for doubtful recoverability and foreseeable losses and represented the groups maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables.
The group has no significant concentrations of credit risk since the risk is spread over a large number of unrelated counterparties.

The facility was entered into on 19 September 2005 and refinanced a pre-existing 330 million facility on substantially the same terms.
At 31 December 2005, drawings under the facility carried an interest rate of 1.1 per cent over LIBOR 2004: 0.875 per cent above LIBOR a 348 million 238 million term loan maturing on 19 September 2010.
The facility was also entered into on 19 September 2005 and was made available solely for the purpose of the acquisition of shares in Unilog and payment of associated transaction costs.
The term loan was undrawn at 31 December 2005.
The obligations of the borrowers under both bank loans are guaranteed by the principal UK and Dutch trading subsidiaries, LogicaCMG UK Limited and LogicaCMG Nederland B. V. Convertible bonds The convertible bonds bear a fixed coupon rate of 2.875 per cent per annum, payable annually in arrears, and were issued at par value of 303.4 million on 19 September 2003.
Each 1,000 principal amount of a bond is convertible into one 2.875 per cent exchangeable redeemable preference shares of the issuer, LogicaCMG Jersey Limited, with paid-up value of 1,000 that will, in turn, be exchangeable immediately for ordinary shares of LogicaCMG plc.
The bonds can be converted by the holders at any time between 29 October 2003 and up to 14 days prior to 19 September 2008.
The number of ordinary shares into which the bonds are convertible is determined by translating the principal amount into pounds sterling at a fixed exchange rate of 1.44862 to 1 and then dividing by the prevailing exchange price.
The exchange price is the price at which the sterling-equivalent par value of the 2.875 per cent exchangeable redeemable preference shares is converted into ordinary shares of the company.
The initial exchange price on issue was 372.53 pence per share.
Following the rights issue in November 2005, the exchange price was revised to 324.0 pence per share to reflect the bonus element of the rights issue.
The bond issuer may, at its option, redeem the bonds at any time from 3 October 2006 if the companys share price is greater than 140 per cent of the prevailing exchange price on at least 20 dealing days during a period of 30 consecutive dealing days, or, at any time, if 85 per cent or more of the principal amount of the bonds have been previously converted or purchased and cancelled.
At 31 December 2005, the bond holders held rights over the allotment of 64,635,376 2004: 56,215,236 ordinary shares of LogicaCMG plc.
The convertible bonds were designated as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss with effect from 1 January 2005, prior to this date the bonds were held at amortised cost.
The change in the carrying value of the convertible bonds from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2005 was a net reduction of 6.3 million, of which an increase of 0.9 million was attributable an increase in their underlying fair value and a decrease of 7.2 million was attributable to changes in exchange rate between euros and pounds sterling.
The change in underlying fair value not attributable to changes in 12 month EURIBOR was an increase of 2.4 million.
At maturity, the group would be contractually required to repay 303.4 million 207.8 million compared to a fair value on 31 December 2005 of 299.3 million 205.0 million.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements requires that liabilities should be classified as current when the entity does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.
The convertible bonds are potentially exchangeable into ordinary shares of the company at any time up to 14 days prior to 19 September 2008.
Accordingly, the convertible bonds have been classified as a current liability even though settlement may ultimately not occur until the redemption date of 19 September 2008.

All borrowings Bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes and other borrowings, bear floating rates of interest based on LIBOR or foreign equivalents appropriate to the country in which the borrowing is incurred, and thus expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The convertible bonds and finance lease obligations bear fixed rates of interest and therefore expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
The weighted average effective interest rate on borrowings at the balance sheet date was as follows: 2005 % Bank loans 5.0 Finance lease obligations 5.1 Convertible bonds 2.9 Loan notes 3.7 The mark-to-market movement in the convertible bonds recognised as either interest expense or interest income has not been included in calculating the effective interest rate on the convertible bonds in the table above.
An analysis of borrowings at the balance sheet date by the earlier of maturity or, for floating rate borrowings, the earliest contractual repricing date was as follows: 2005 m On demand or within one year 333.7 In one to two years 6.6 In two to three years 1.1 In three to four years In four to five years In more than five years 341.4 All borrowings are denominated in the borrowing entitys functional currency except for the convertible bonds and certain amounts drawn down under the revolving credit facility.
Borrowings not denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing company are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations see note 23 and therefore only expose the group to income statement foreign currency risk to the extent that the hedge is ineffective.
The directors have estimated the fair value of the groups borrowings as follows: 2005 2004 m m Bank overdrafts 0.4 Bank loans 135.9 89.0 Finance lease obligations 4.8 4.7 Convertible bonds 205.0 211.3 Loan notes 0.4 0.4 Other borrowings 0.5 346.1 306.3 Fair value has been estimated by discounting the cash flows relating to borrowings at the market rate at the balance sheet date or, for the quoted instruments, by reference to the prevailing market price and exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

Financial instruments Financial risk management The multi-national nature of the groups operations and their financing expose it to a variety of financial risks.
The principal risks that the group is exposed to are foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The groups policies with respect to managing those risks in both the current and prior year are set out below.
The group does not undertake any trading or speculative activity in financial instruments.
The group operates within policies and procedures that are formally approved by the board, which include strict controls on the use of financial instruments in managing the groups risks.
Foreign exchange risk The group has operations in many countries worldwide, exposing the group to foreign exchange risk on the translation of the income statement and balance sheet of foreign operations into pounds sterling.
Operations are also subject to foreign exchange risk from committed transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency and, once recognised, the revaluation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
The translation of the balance sheets of overseas operations has been substantially hedged by managing the currency mix of the groups borrowings.
The group uses both euro and US dollar borrowings to hedge the balance sheet translation of operations with the euro and US dollar as their functional currency.
The group does not hedge the foreign exchange risk relating to the translation of the income statements of overseas operations.
To mitigate foreign exchange risk arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than an entitys functional currency, amounts not denominated in the functional currencies are hedged economically by means of forward contracts or currency overdrafts.
Interest rate risk The group's policy is to fund its operations through a mixture of retained earnings, equity and debt.
Careful consideration is given to the appropriate split of debt and equity to ensure acceptable levels of liquidity and interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk is then further managed by holding a portion of the group's borrowings at fixed rates of interest.
At 31 December 2005, the group had 221.0 million 2004: 215.9 million of fixed rate borrowings out of total borrowings of 341.4 million 2004: 304.9 million.
Liquidity risk The groups policy is to maintain sufficient headroom to meet its foreseeable financing requirements.
Substantial committed facilities are maintained with a syndicate of leading international banks.
At 31 December 2005, the group had committed floating rate bank facilities of 568.4 million 2004: 330.0 million of which 114.6 million 2004: 65.0 million had been drawn down.
The highest amount drawn down on these facilities during 2005 was 237.5 million 2004: 120.0 million.
Derivative financial instruments The following table shows the value and type of derivative financial instruments recognised as separate assets and liabilities in the balance sheet at 31 December.
2005 Assets Liabilities m m Forward foreign exchange contracts 2.1 0.3 The principal currencies of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at 31 December 2005 were the euro and the US dollar.
The notional amounts outstanding at that date were 172.9 million net buying and $93.1 million net selling.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations The group has both euro and US dollar borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries in eurozone countries and the United States.
On 1 January 2005, the designated borrowings comprised the 2.875 per cent 2008 convertible bonds.
The euro and US dollar amounts drawn down under the groups 330 million revolving credit facility were designated as additional hedging instruments during 2005.
The fair value of the designated euro borrowings at 31 December 2005 was 253.6 million 1 January 2005: 211.3 million and of the US dollar borrowings was 15.9 million 1 January 2005: nil.
The foreign exchange gain of 5.2 million relating to these borrowings in the year ended 31 December 2005 has been recognised directly in the translation reserve.
Cash flows hedges During the year ended 31 December 2005, the group designated a portfolio of purchased foreign currency options as cash flow hedges of payments to acquire an associate interest in Unilog.
The options were designated as a hedge of the value of the consideration payments, which were denominated in euros.
All the options expired prior to the balance sheet date.
The change in the fair value of the options, a loss of 1.2 million, was recognised initially in the hedging reserve and then recycled to the carrying amount of the associate investment in Unilog as consideration payments were made during the year.
At 31 December 2005, the group had no designated cash flow hedges.
2004 comparative information under FRS 13 The group has taken an exemption available in IFRS 1 to apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005 and to apply UK GAAP to 2004 comparative information for financial instruments.
The following additional disclosures for 2004 are provided to comply with the requirements of FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures where such disclosure is not provided elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements.
Trade receivables, trade payables, current tax assets and liabilities, and current provisions have been excluded from the disclosures, as permitted by the standard.

Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The interest rate risk profile of the groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2004 was as follows: Financial Financial liabilities on Floating Fixed assets on Floating Fixed which no rate rate which no rate rate interest is financial financial interest is financial financial paid liabilities liabilities receivable assets assets Total Currency m m m m m m m Sterling 5.9 88.1 0.9 24.8 23.1 47.0 Euro 0.3 0.5 215.0 8.0 39.5 5.2 163.1 Other currencies 0.4 11.0 16.5 2.6 29.7 6.2 89.0 215.9 43.8 79.1 7.8 180.4 Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid related to non-current provisions, all other financial liabilities in the table above relate to borrowings.
Financial assets on which no interest is receivable included 24.1 million of amounts recoverable on contracts due in more than one year, all other financial assets related to cash and cash equivalents including 1.7 million presented within non-current assets classified as held for sale.
Floating rate financial liabilities bore interest at rates, based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents, which are fixed in advance for periods of between one day and six months.
The weighted average period until maturity for floating rate financial liabilities on which interest is paid was 39 months at 31 December 2004.
Fixed rate financial liabilities at 31 December 2004 represented amounts outstanding on convertible bonds and finance lease obligations.
The average interest rate on fixed rate liabilities was 2.9 per cent.
The weighted average period for which rates were fixed on these financial liabilities was 44 months.
Financial assets generally earn interest at a floating rate based on relevant national LIBID equivalents or government bonds fixed in advance for periods ranging from one day to one month.
To ensure immediate access without material interest rate penalty, group cash and liquid resources were primarily invested on a floating rate basis throughout 2004.
Hedges The table below shows the extent to which the group had unrecognised gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as economic hedges at the beginning and the end of the 2004 financial year.
It also shows the amount of such gains and losses which have been included in the income statement for 2004 and those gains and losses which are expected to be included in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2005, or later years.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and the group intends to settle the balances on a net basis.
An analysis of the deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes is shown in the table below: 2005 2004 m m Deferred tax assets 36.0 33.3 Deferred tax liabilities 56.3 45.3 20.3 12.0 At 31 December 2005, the group had unused tax losses of 170.6 million 2004: 191.4 million available for offset against future taxable profits for which no deferred tax asset had been recognised.
At 31 December 2005, 25.4 million 2004: 19.8 million of the losses are subject to time expiry rules and will expire in full on or before 31 December 2022.
No deferred tax liability was recognised in respect of the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The group has estimated that tax of 16.4 million 2004: 11.1 million would arise in respect of remitting all earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the United Kingdom to the extent legally possible.

Other reserves continued Treasury shares The group holds treasury shares in three discretionary trusts which were set up for the benefit of LogicaCMG employees.
The trusts purchase the companys shares in the market for use in connection with the groups share-based payment arrangements.
The amounts shown in the treasury shares reserve at 31 December each year would be deducted in determining the distributable profits of the company at that date.
At 31 December 2005, the employee trusts owned 15,741,068 ordinary shares 2004: 13,993,706 with a nominal value of 1.6 million 2004: 1.4 million.
The trustees of the CMG ESOP Trust and the Logica ESOP Trust have agreed to waive the right to future dividends on ordinary shares held by the trusts except for a nominal amount.
At 31 December 2005 and 2004, the nominal amount payable to both trusts was 0.001 pence per share.
Following the announcement of the rights issue in September 2005, the trusts sold their rights to subscribe for ordinary shares and re-invested the proceeds in the market purchase of ordinary shares of the company.
Translation reserve The translation reserve represents the accumulated exchange differences arising from the following sources: the impact of the translation of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than pounds sterling: and exchange differences arising on hedging instruments that are designated hedges of a net investment in foreign operations, net of tax where applicable.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve contains the accumulated gains and losses on hedging instruments that are a designated cash flow hedge less amounts recycled to the income statement or into the carrying value of hedged assets or liabilities.

The groups net debt at 31 December 2004 was 198.3 million.
The impact of the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 was to increase group net debt by 20.9 million to 219.2 million.
The increase comprised a reclassification of 20.8 million from trade and other receivables to bank loans relating to non-recourse financing arrangements previously shown under a linked presentation, and an increase in the value of convertible bonds of 0.1 million to reflect their fair value.
The increase in the value of convertible bonds of 0.1 million comprised a reclassification of the accrual for coupon interest of 1.7 million from trade and other payables, and a reduction of 1.6 million taken to equity on adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 1 January 2005.
The cash and cash equivalents balance of 106.6 million at 1 January 2005 in the table above included 1.7 million of cash and cash equivalents which are shown in the consolidated balance sheet within non-current assets classified as held for sale.
Cash and cash equivalents at the balance sheet date comprised: 2005 2004 m m Cash at bank and in hand 135.1 104.8 Short-term deposits 110.2 1.8 Cash and cash equivalents 245.3 106.6 Cash and cash equivalents were invested on a floating rate basis and were therefore subject to cash flow interest rate risk.
The directors estimate that the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximated their fair value.
The groups credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because the counterparties are well-established banks with high credit ratings.
Included in cash and cash equivalents were overdrafts that were part of cash pooling arrangements for which a legal right of off-set existed against positive cash balances that were of an equal or greater amount at the balance sheet date.

Acquisition of subsidiary On 20 April 2005, the group acquired 60 per cent of the voting rights of Edinfor Sistemas Informticos, S. A. Edinfor from Energias fide Portugal EDP.
The Edinfor group of companies is a leading IT services provider based in Portugal.
The minority interest of 40 per cent is subject to an EDP put option and a LogicaCMG call option.
The EDP put option is exercisable at any time in the period two years from the acquisition date to four years from the acquisition date.
The LogicaCMG call option is exercisable at any time four years after the acquisition date.
The majority interest of 60 per cent held by the group is subject to an EDP call option.
This option is only exercisable in limited circumstances which the group does not expect to occur.

Cash outflows relating to transaction costs and payments of deferred consideration were a further 4.1 million, resulting in a cash outflow for the Edinfor acquisition, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, of 46.4 million during the year.
The goodwill recognised of 23.8 million is attributable to anticipated synergies and the value of the work force.
Edinfor contributed revenues of 88.0 million and net profit of 4.4 million for the period from 20 April 2005 to 31 December 2005.
If the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the financial year, the groups pro forma revenue and net profit for the year ended 31 December 2005 would have been approximately 1,869.6 million and 74.5 million respectively, based on the following principal assumptions: alignment of Edinfors accounting policies with those of the LogicaCMG group for the period pre-acquisition: fair value adjustments made as if they had occurred at the beginning of the financial year, with subsequent consequential adjustments to depreciation, amortisation and other related items of income and expense: an increased interest cost to reflect debt funding of the acquisition from 1 January 2005: and the tax effect of the adjustments above.

Share-based payment Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements The group operates four equity-settled share-based payment arrangements: the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS, the Sharesave scheme, the Executive Equity Partnership Plan ExEPP and the Employee Equity Partnership Plan EmEPP.
A summary of the main terms of the arrangements is given below, with particular reference made to the terms of those grants for which a share-based payment expense has been recognised.
Executive Share Option Scheme Option grants under the ESOS are made to senior executives and managers across the group, as well as to staff with high potential or to recognise significant achievements.
Options will normally be exercisable between three and ten years following grant, provided that a performance condition, specified at the date of grant, has been satisfied.
Typically, growth in the groups earnings per share over the relevant performance period is required to exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index by at least 21 per cent for the performance condition to be met.
ESOS option grants prior to 2005 have a maximum seven year exercise period, however, option grants in 2005 have a four year exercise period.
Retesting of performance conditions may be carried out twice for 2003 option grants, once for 2004 option grants and no retesting is permitted on grants made in 2005.
The exercise price of ESOS options is generally at least equal to the mid-market price of the companys shares on the date of grant, although the pricing mechanism varies slightly for grants to French employees.
Sharesave Scheme The group operates a savings-related share option scheme under which employees enter into a savings contract with a financial institution to pay a fixed monthly sum for either a three year or, for grants before 4 October 2002, five year period.
Share options are granted, at an exercise price at least equal to the mid-market price of the companys shares on the date of grant, such that the aggregate exercise price payable is equal to the expected proceeds on maturity of the savings contract.
Share options may be exercised within six months of the vesting date.
There are no performance conditions attached to sharesave scheme options.
Equity Partnership Plans The group operates an equity partnership plan for senior executives, the ExEPP, and an equity partnership plan open to all employees in certain countries, the EmEPP, the terms of which are similar.
Under the equity partnership plans, employees make an investment in the companys shares, subject to financial limits, which must be maintained over a three year vesting period.
Awards of a matching number of shares are made at nil cost to employees and are exercisable for up to seven years after the vesting date, after which the award will expire.
Vesting will occur for those participants employed at the vesting date, subject to a performance condition being met.
The performance conditions vary by scheme and grant date.
Typically, growth in the groups earnings per share must exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by between 3 per cent and 7 per cent per annum, dependant on the scheme and grant date, in each year in the performance period for the award to vest in full.
The Remuneration Committee may, at its discretion, allow matching awards under the EmEPP to vest pro rata if performance conditions are met in only one or two years out of the three year performance period.
A reconciliation of the movement in the number of share options and share awards outstanding is shown below: 2005 Share options Share awards Weighted average Number of exercise price Number of shares shares Outstanding at 1 January 2005 35,763,902 3.44 791,281 Granted 13,952,490 1.80 221,031 Exercised 74,713 1.29 8,387 Forfeited 4,562,199 3.70 254,271 Expired 3,741,178 5.45 Outstanding at 9 October 2005 41,338,302 2.68 749,654 Impact of rights issue 5,694,437 0.32 100,962 Outstanding at 9 October 2005 47,032,739 2.36 850,616 Exercised 180,508 0.95 4,662 Forfeited 743,870 2.21 14,475 Expired 419,790 4.60 Outstanding at 31 December 2005 45,688,571 2.34 831,479 Exercisable at 31 December 2005 10,685,155 3.86 163,341 LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2005 Consolidated financial statements P73 32.

The number of share options outstanding on 9 October 2005 and their respective exercise prices were adjusted to take account of the bonus element of the rights issue during 2005.
The exercise price of share options outstanding was repriced by applying an adjustment factor of 0.87896.
In addition, the number of share options outstanding was increased for each share option holder, in proportion to their holding, by the reciprocal factor of 1.13770.
The adjustment factor of 1.13770 was also applied to the number of shares awards outstanding under the Equity Partnership Plans on the same date.
Where the adjustment to the number of share options and awards did not give rise to a whole number, the number of share options and awards were rounded down to the nearest whole number on an  basis.
The adjustments to the exercise price of share options and the number of share options and share awards did not have a material impact on the aggregate fair value of share options and share awards outstanding.
The exercise price and remaining contractual life of share options outstanding at the balance sheet date was as follows: 2005 Weighted Weighted average average remaining exercise price contractual life Number of Range of exercise prices Years shares Less than 1.00 0.81 3.1 4,875,690 More than 1.00 and less than 2.00 1.47 5.4 20,770,477 More than 2.00 and less than 5.00 2.61 4.4 16,943,453 More than 5.00 and less than 10.00 6.27 4.6 2,127,449 More than 10.00 15.44 4.4 971,502 2.34 4.7 45,668,571 2004 Weighted Weighted average average remaining exercise price contractual life Number of Range of exercise prices Years shares Less than 1.00 0.92 4.2 4,980,498 More than 1.00 and less than 2.00 1.32 7.4 5,583,158 More than 2.00 and less than 5.00 2.93 5.3 17,453,039 More than 5.00 and less than 10.00 6.04 2.6 6,636,602 More than 10.00 17.80 5.0 1,110,605 3.44 5.0 35,763,902 The fair value of share options and share awards granted in the 2005 and 2004 financial years and the assumptions used in the calculation of their fair value on the date of grant were as follows.

The balance are exercised after 7 years, providing the options are in the money.
2 The expected exercise behaviour of ESOS option holders for grants made in 2004 is as follows: 60 per cent of participants exercise after 3 years and 25 per cent after 6 years, subject to the market share price being at least 20 per cent over the option exercise price.
The balance are exercised after 10 years, providing the options are in the money.
The fair value of ESOS options was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model and the fair value of Sharesave scheme options was measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The fair value of share awards under the Equity Partnership Plans was measured at the market share price at the date of grant reduced for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period, for which award holders have no entitlement.
Expected volatility was determined using the historical volatility of the companys share price over a period commensurate with the expected life of the share option.
The period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2001 was excluded as management believe it represented a period of high share price volatility which is unlikely to be repeated in the future.
Share awards under the Equity Partnership Plans are assumed to be exercised on the vesting date.
Sharesave options are assumed to be exercised three months after the vesting date, the mid-point of the contractual exercise period.
At the date of grant, it is assumed that performance conditions will be met in full.
Adjustments are made subsequently, where necessary, to reflect updated assessments of whether performance conditions will be met and the final determination on the vesting date.
The sharebased payment expense also takes account of expected forfeiture from the balance sheet date to the end of the vesting period following cessation of employment.
A weighted average forfeiture rate of 10 per cent per annum was assumed for calculating the share-based payment expense for the year ended 31 December 2005 2004: 5 per cent.
The group recognised a total expense in respect of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements of 5.9 million in the year ended 31 December 2005 2004: 5.7 million.
Cash-settled share-based payment arrangements The group does not operate separate cash-settled share-based payments arrangements, however, social security obligations arising on share option and share award schemes are treated as such an arrangement for accounting purposes.
The liability for cash-settled share-based social security payments at 31 December 2005 was 1.2 million 2004: 0.8 million.
The movement in the liability resulted in an expense for the year ended 31 December 2005 of 0.4 million 2004: gain of 0.1 million.
Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The group operates a number of voluntary pension schemes of the defined contribution type in the UK and overseas, under which contributions are paid by group undertakings.
In some countries, contributions are made into state pension schemes.
The pension cost charge for defined contribution schemes amounted to 35.3 million 2004: 35.2 million.
Defined benefit schemes In addition, the group operates defined benefit pension schemes primarily for the benefit of employees in the UK and the Netherlands, with smaller schemes in other European countries.
Defined benefit schemes are usually funded by contributions from the employing companies, and in some cases also employees, to the meet the costs, at rates assessed by the actuary or insurer of each scheme, in regular funding reviews.
The schemes assets are held in funds separate from those of the group.
Scheme benefits typically provide for a pension in retirement based on a years of qualifying service and final pensionable salary.
The most recent valuations of plan assets, reimbursement rights and defined benefit obligations were carried out at 31 December 2005 by qualified actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit credit method.
A revision to the deficit on the CMG UK Pension Scheme as at 31 December 2004 has been made compared to information previously published by the group under IFRS, details of which are provided in note 38.
Comparative information for this scheme has been amended accordingly within the disclosures below.

The actual return on reimbursement rights for overseas schemes was 0.7 million 2004: 0.5 million.
Actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense.

The expected rate of return on equities is determined by reference to real historical equity market returns.
The overall expected rate of return on plan assets is calculated as a weighted average of the expected rates of return of individual assets classes.
The weighted average is calculated by reference to the amount in each class of plan assets at the balance sheet date.
Plan assets in overseas schemes include ordinary shares of the company with a fair value of 2.2 million at 31 December 2005 2004: 2.4 million but do not include any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the group.

Contingent liabilities The group has contingent liabilities arising during the ordinary course of business from which it is anticipated that no material loss will arise.
Events after the balance sheet date On 13 January 2006, the group acquired a controlling 96.6 per cent interest in the ordinary share capital of Unilog S. A. Unilog.
Due to the existence of shares with double voting rights not held by the group, this equated to a 95.8 per cent interest in the voting rights of Unilog.
The Unilog group of companies is a leading IT services provider of management and IT consultancy, systems integration, outsourcing and training services based in France and with overseas offices in Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Austria and Luxembourg.
The groups 96.6 per cent interest in Unilog at the date of acquisition was acquired through the following steps: - a block trade purchase from certain members of the senior management of Unilog of 32.3 per cent on 25 October 2005: - market purchases during November, December 2005 and January 2006, amounting to an additional 14.8 per cent interest: and - a further bulk purchase of 49.5 per cent on 13 January 2006 following the completion of the public tender offer.
The cost of the acquisition of 619.6 million is analysed below.
The cost of acquisition included 19,572,703 ordinary shares issued as part of the block trade purchase.
The shares were attributed a fair value based on the closing mid-market price prevailing on 25 October 2005 of 143.5 pence.

Transition to IFRS On 17 May 2005, the group published an explanation of the impact of the transition to IFRS together with restated comparative information for 2004 under IFRS and reconciliations from UK GAAP.
This disclosure note reproduces information from the groups previous announcement, amended for the following adjustments which affect the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2004: an increase of 21.5 million in the retirement benefit liability associated with the CMG UK Pension Scheme, together with a consequential increase in deferred tax assets of 6.4 million: an increase of 1.7 million 1 January 2004: 1.8 million in deferred tax assets relating to the release of deferred tax previously recognised for goodwill generated on the acquisition of a business in Australia in 2000: and a reclassification of the groups convertible debt, amounting to 211.2 million, to current liabilities from non-current liabilities.
Following the results of the most recent triennial actuarial valuation of the CMG UK Pension Scheme, which was completed in December 2005, the deficit on the scheme as at 31 December 2004 has been revised from 43.9 million to 65.4 million.
The scheme deficit as previously reported was based on a roll-forward of the defined benefit obligation from the formal actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 1 July 2002 using estimation techniques, as permitted under IFRS.
The most recent actuarial valuation has shown that the use of estimation techniques understated the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2004 compared to a comprehensive member-by-member assessment of the defined benefit obligation.
As a consequence of the materiality of the adjustment, 2004 comparative information has been amended.
The deficit on the scheme as at 31 December 2003 remains unaffected by this revision.
Notes a to i below explain the impact that the adoption of IFRS has had on comparative information as at and for the year ended 31 December 2004 and as at the date of transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004.
Note j explains the impact of the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 at 1 January 2005.
The narrative section is intended to support the associated numerical reconciliations contained in notes 38.1 to 38.4 below.
a Goodwill Under UK GAAP, goodwill was treated in two ways.
Prior to 1 July 1998, goodwill arising under the acquisition accounting method was written off directly to equity and recycled to the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss on disposal of the acquired entity.
Subsequent to that date, goodwill was capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life, up to a maximum period of 20 years.
The group has taken the exemption in IFRS 1 for business combinations.
As a result, the net book value of goodwill under UK GAAP at 31 December 2003 became the deemed cost of goodwill at the date of transition to IFRS.
Under IFRS, this balance is no longer amortised but is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment.
Goodwill previously written off directly to equity is not recycled to the income statement following a disposal of a previously acquired entity.
The effect of adopting IFRS was to reverse the goodwill amortisation recognised under UK GAAP and to increase the carrying value of goodwill in the balance sheet at 31 December 2004. b Other intangible assets Development costs Under UK GAAP, the development costs of internally developed software products and enhancements were expensed as incurred irrespective of the future value expected from the results of the development activity.
IAS 38 Intangible Assets requires that development costs are capitalised when the criteria set out in the standard are met.
Development costs can only be capitalised when an intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits and costs can be reliably measured.
Once development activity on a software product or enhancement has finished, any capitalised costs are amortised over the useful life of the product, typically over a period of up to three years.
The effect of adopting IFRS was to capitalise development costs previously expensed under UK GAAP and therefore to increase the carrying value of intangible assets.
The impact on the income statement was the net effect of the capitalisation of any development costs that meet the IAS 38 criteria during the period and the amortisation of costs capitalised in the balance sheet.
Software licences Under UK GAAP, purchased software licences were capitalised within tangible fixed assets as part of the computer hardware to which they related and depreciated over their useful economic life.
IAS 38 requires that computer software that is an integral part of the related hardware, such as an operating system, is treated as property, plant and equipment.
Software that is not an integral part of the related hardware must be capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over its useful economic life.
The effect of this change was to reclassify certain software licences from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets in the balance sheet and to reclassify the related depreciation expense to amortisation expense in the income statement.
LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2005 Consolidated financial statements P81 38.
Transition to IFRS continued c Leases The UK GAAP accounting standard on leases, SSAP 21 Accounting for leases and hire purchase contracts, is similar to the IFRS standard, IAS 17 Leases, in terms of the classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a finance lease.
Whilst both standards define a finance lease as a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the lessee, SSAP 21 provides a numeric test, which does not exist in IAS 17, that was used as persuasive evidence of whether this transfer had taken place.
A consequence of adopting IAS 17 has been that some leases previously classified as operating leases under UK GAAP have been classified as finance leases under IFRS.
The impact on the balance sheet at 31 December 2004 was to capitalise assets under finance leases within property, plant and equipment at their deemed cost less accumulated depreciation.
A related liability, classified as a borrowing, for future lease payments was also recognised.
The impact on the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004 was limited, the main consequence being a reduction in net operating costs and an increase in interest payable.
d Employee benefits Retirement benefit schemes Under UK GAAP, the group accounted for defined benefit and defined contribution retirement benefit schemes under SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs.
Additional disclosures were given under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
Under SSAP 24, a regular pension cost for defined benefit schemes was determined using actuarial methods and charged to the profit and loss account.
Variations from the regular cost caused by, for example, retroactive changes in benefits, changes in actuarial assumptions, and experience gains and losses, were spread over the average remaining service lives of employees.
The cumulative difference between the profit and loss account expense and employer contributions was held in the balance sheet as either a prepayment or provision.
Under IFRS, the group applies IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
This standard follows a balance sheet approach which is similar to that of FRS 17 whereby scheme deficits or surpluses are recognised on the balance sheet.
The income statement expense comprises the current service cost, the interest cost, the expected return on any plan assets and the appropriate portion of any past service cost.
The group has adopted early the amendment to IAS 19 in December 2004 which allows actuarial gains and losses to be recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The effect of adopting IFRS on the balance sheet at 31 December 2004 was to remove any pension prepayment or provision recognised under UK GAAP and to recognise the net deficit or surplus, when permitted, on defined benefit schemes less any unrecognised past service cost.
The impact on the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004 was to increase the pension expense in operating profit and to recognise a net charge to interest payable.
Holiday pay The groups UK GAAP accounting policy was to accrue for all payments expected to be made to leavers within one year of the balance sheet date for holiday entitlement not used prior to leaving.
IAS 19 requires that a liability is recorded for all accrued entitlements for holiday at each balance sheet date.
The impact on the group was to increase the employee benefits liability at 31 December 2004 and increase the expense in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Share-based payments The group operates a variety of share-based employee incentive arrangements which typically include the grant of rights to shares or share options.
Under UK GAAP, a charge was recorded only when an award had intrinsic value on the date of grant i. e. the market value of the companys shares on the date of grant exceeded the exercise price of the award.
A charge was not recorded for share options schemes as the exercise price of share options was set at the prevailing market price on the grant date.
A charge was recorded for the employee and executive equity partnership plans under which rights to shares were granted at no cost to employees, subject to meeting performance conditions.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment requires that an expense is recognised in the income statement based on the fair value of an award on the date of grant.
The expense is spread over the period for which services are received from employees, which is assumed to be the performance period of the award.
The fair value of share options is measured using an option-pricing model.
The Black-Scholes model has been used to determine the fair value of options granted under SAYE schemes.
A Monte Carlo simulation model has been used for executive share options.
IFRS 2 requires a liability to be recorded for social security costs on gains from the exercise of share options.
The liability is measured based on the fair value of share options outstanding at each balance sheet date.
Under UK GAAP, a liability for social security was recorded only when share options had intrinsic value.
The impact of adopting IFRS was to increase the share-based payments expense in the income statement.
This is principally because an expense is now recognised for share option schemes where none was recognised under UK GAAP.
The liability in the balance sheet at 31 December 2004 for social security on share options increased compared to UK GAAP, however, the effect on the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004 was not significant.
P82 Consolidated financial statements LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2005 38.
Transition to IFRS continued e Foreign currencies IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates contains more prescriptive guidance than UK GAAP on how to determine an entitys functional currency, the application of which may, in some circumstances, result in a different outcome.
As a consequence of evaluating the functional currencies of group entities under IFRS, the functional currencies of some overseas branches have changed.
The effect of the changes has been to reduce the value of amounts recoverable on contracts in the balance sheet at 31 December 2004 and to increase net operating expenses in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004. f Taxation Deferred tax under UK GAAP was provided on all timing differences that had originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences arise when gains and losses are included in tax computations in a later or earlier period from that in which they appear in the groups financial statements.
IAS 12 Income Taxes has a balance sheet focused approach.
The standard requires that full provision be made for all taxable temporary differences except those arising on goodwill.
A temporary difference is the difference between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its associated tax base.
A temporary difference is a taxable temporary difference if it will give rise to taxable amounts in the future when the asset or liability is settled.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are classified as non-current irrespective of the expected timing of the reversal of the underlying taxable temporary difference.
Current tax assets and liabilities are shown separately on the face of the balance sheet.
The principal impact of adopting IFRS was to recognise deferred tax on retirement benefit scheme deficits and surpluses, adjustments to holiday pay liabilities and share-based payments.
g Dividends Under UK GAAP, dividends were recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account.
An accrual was made for dividends that were proposed by directors after the balance sheet date but prior to the date of the signing of the financial statements and a corresponding expense was recognised.
Distributions to equity holders are not recognised in the income statement under IFRS, they are disclosed as a component of the movement in shareholders equity.
A liability is recorded for a final dividend when the dividend is approved by the companys shareholders, and for an interim dividend when the dividend is paid.
The impact of IFRS was to remove the accrual for the 2004 final dividend in the balance sheet at 31 December 2004. h Borrowings Under UK GAAP, the convertible bonds were presented as a non-current liability.
FRS 4 Capital instruments required that conversion of debt was not anticipated and this was reflected in the presentation as well as the measurement of the convertible bonds.
The convertible bonds are potentially exchangeable into ordinary shares of the company on any day from 1 January 2005 up to and including 5 September 2008.
Accordingly, at 31 December 2004, the company did not have the right to defer settlement for at least twelve months and therefore the convertible bonds have been re-classified as a current liability under IFRS.
i Cash flow statement Although there was no effect on the underlying cash generation and expenditures of the group, there were some presentational changes on the adoption of IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements.
The cash flow statement under IFRS shows the movement in cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents include short-term deposits with a maturity of less than three months, which were included in the management of liquid resources category under UK GAAP.
The balance sheet under IFRS at 31 December 2004 included 1.8 million of cash equivalents previously classified as a liquid deposit in the UK GAAP cash flow statement.
In addition, further presentational changes were made to reflect the different accounting treatment of certain items under IFRS.
The two principal reclassifications were for finance leases previously classified as operating leases under UK GAAP and software product development expenditure.
Under IFRS, the capital repayments of finance leases were treated as a financing cash flow, whereas as an operating lease under UK GAAP, the lease payments were treated as an operating cash flow.
Product development expenditure previously expensed and classified as an operating cash flow under UK GAAP has been classified as a cash flow from investing activities under IFRS when the development expenditure was capitalised as an intangible asset.
LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2005 Consolidated financial statements P83 38.
Transition to IFRS continued j Adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 This section describes the impact of the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 with effect from 1 January 2005.
Non-recourse financing Under UK GAAP, non-recourse financing arrangements that met the conditions set out in FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions were shown under a linked presentation, with the financing shown as a deduction from the gross amount of the asset to which it related.
Such a presentation is not permissible under IAS 32 and IAS 39 and the financing in such arrangements has been classified as borrowings.
The impact of adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 was to increase trade and other receivables and borrowings by 20.8 million.
There was no impact on equity.
Derivative financial instruments Under UK GAAP, foreign currency assets and liabilities that were covered by a related forward contract were translated at the rate of exchange specified in that contract.
Under IFRS, such assets and liabilities are translated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date and forward contracts, as derivative financial instruments, are recognised separately in the balance sheet at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in the income statement unless covered by a designated hedge which permits gains and losses to be deferred in equity.
IFRS also requires that derivatives embedded in host contracts are separated and accounted for as derivative financial instruments, if certain conditions are met.
The impact of adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 was to recognise on the balance sheet the fair value of all derivative financial instruments and retranslate foreign currency assets and liabilities at the rates prevailing on the date of adoption.
The difference between the amounts recognised under UK GAAP and IFRS, 0.3 million, was taken to equity.
Convertible bonds Under UK GAAP, the convertible bonds were presented separately on the face of the balance sheet at par value less unamortised issue costs.
Conversion of the bonds was not anticipated.
The accrual for coupon interest was classified within trade and other payables.
Exchange differences arising on retranslation of the convertible bonds were offset in equity against the retranslation of foreign currency net investments, to the extent permitted.
Under IFRS, the group took the option to designate the convertible bonds as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss.
The fluctuation in the value of the convertible bonds caused by changes in the quoted market price is recorded as interest income or expense, as appropriate.
The change in fair value associated with the accretion of coupon interest is recognised as interest expense.
Exchange differences are taken directly to equity under a designated net investment hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective.
The impact of adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 was a reduction in the value of the convertible bonds of 1.6 million, reflecting the difference between the par value and quoted market price of the convertible bonds and the write off of unamortised issue costs, together with an equal and opposite movement in equity.
