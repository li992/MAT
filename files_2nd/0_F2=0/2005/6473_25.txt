Dilution increases the weighted average number of shares to 84,674,664 2004: 83,562,055.
The dilution effect is caused by the inclusion of 74,896 share options 2004: 40,365.
There is no change in profit after taxation.
For the purposes of disclosures required by FRS14 none of the potential ordinary shares are regarded as being dilutive as their conversion would reduce the basic loss per share.
Consequently the diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share.
