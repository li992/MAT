Goodwill continued The impairment review has resulted in an impairment charge of 6.5 million in respect of one of the Groups companies in Japan 2004 impairments of nil following the deterioration in the performance of this business.
The allocation of goodwill presented above is net of this impairment charge.
The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following four years based on estimated growth rates of between 6% and 16%.
After this time, cash flows are extrapolated based on the estimated long-term growth in gross domestic product of 2.5%.
Cash flow projections are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 12.75%.
Expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could materially change over time.
They are significantly affected by a number of factors such as market growth, discount rates, currency exchange rates and future capital expenditure.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed their recoverable amounts.
