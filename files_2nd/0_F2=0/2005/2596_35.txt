Notes continued 27 Acquisitions continued When assessing the fair value of assets acquired, the Group has made adjustments to property, plant and equipment, inventories, receivables and payables to reflect the estimated realisable or settlement value.
To date the Company has recognised customer lists and relationships as separately identifiable intangible assets.
Finally, adjustments have been made to accruals and provisions to include amounts in respect of onerous contracts and other commitments that existed at the acquisition date.
The accounting policies of the acquired businesses have been brought into line with those of the Group with adjustments made where necessary.
All of the provisional fair value adjustments have been made net of any relevant tax effects.
The purchase price for the acquisitions has been allocated against the identified net assets, with the balance recorded as goodwill.
The acquisitions provide opportunities for further development of the Groups activities and in most cases create enhanced returns.
Such opportunities and the workforces inherent in each of the acquired businesses do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets but do represent much of the assessed value that supports the recognised goodwill.
