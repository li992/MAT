42 Explanation of Transition to IFRS This is the first year that the Company has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 December 2004 and the date of transition to IFRS was therefore 1 January 2004.
For further detail on the transition to IFRS refer to the regulatory announcement REG T&F Informa plc IFRS Statement released on 13 June 2005, which is available on the Groups website.

In accordance with IFRS, the purchase accounting method has been used, meaning that the results of Taylor & Francis pre-merger have been eliminated.
This reduces revenue by 54,821,000, operating profit by 3,660,000, profit before tax by 1,506,000 and tax is increased by 1,528,000.
In addition, certain costs, treated as merger costs under UK GAAP, have been reclassified as costs of acquisition and added to goodwill in the balance sheet, resulting in a 15,703,000 reduction in costs for the year ending 31 December 2004.
This increased profit before tax in total by 14,197,000.
2 Under IFRS the Groups share of the result of its joint ventures is not disclosed separately on the face of the income statement and its share of revenue is included in Group revenue.
3 IAS 38 Intangible Assets states that deferred promotional costs, which had previously been capitalised as inventory, must be written off as incurred.
An amount of 4,000,000 was written off from the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2004.
A further, 961,000 was written off in the year ending 31 December 2004 from both the Income Statement and Balance Sheet.
4 Under former UK GAAP, there was no requirement for an expense to be recognised in the financial statements in relation to equity instruments granted, based on their fair value at the date of grant.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments, this expense, which is primarily in relation to employee option and performance share schemes, is then recognised over the vesting period of the relevant scheme.
The charge to the income statement for the year ending 31 December 2004 is 2,560,000.
5 The Group has elected to adopt early the amendment to IAS 19, Employee Benefits issued by the IASB on 16 December 2004 which allows for all actuarial gains and losses to be charged or credited to equity.
The incremental net charge on the Groups income statement is 826,000 for the year ending 31 December 2004.
The transitional adjustment of 13,894,000 to opening reserves comprises the reversal of entries in relation to UK GAAP less the recognition of the net liabilities of the Groups and associated undertakings defined benefit schemes.
The adjustment to the 31 December 2004 Balance Sheet is a further 3,762,000.
6 IAS 38 states that goodwill should not be amortised, but instead subjected to an annual impairment review.
The goodwill amortisation charge previously calculated under UK GAAP has been credited to the profit and loss account.
However, IAS 38 does require the Group to amortise intangible fixed assets over their estimated useful lives.
Further, computer software is considered an intangible asset and therefore the resulting reduction in value of this asset is taken through the amortisation line in the Income Statement.
The resultant net credit to the Groups Income Statement is 20,156,000 for the year ending 31 December 2004, which comprises a reduction of 8,534,000 in intangible fixed assets, an increase of 29,529,000 in goodwill, and the software amortisation amount of 839,000.
7 On the transfer of the trade and assets of PJB Publications Limited to T&F Informa UK Limited on 1 September 2004, a deferred tax asset of 35,386,000 has been recognised with a resultant credit to the Income Statement.
The balance of 3,739,000 is the attributable taxation effect of the above adjustments.

Accordingly, 6,752,000 of computer software has been reclassified from property and equipment to other intangible assets.
9 Under IAS 10 Events After Balance Sheet Date, dividends to shareholders declared after the balance date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date but disclosed separately in the notes.
Under former UK GAAP such dividends were previously recognised as a liability.
The change results in an increase in equity of 8,389,000 at 31 December 2004 7,480,000 as of 1 January 2004.
10 Previously, under former UK GAAP the Group did not recognise a provision for holiday pay, as required under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The Group has recognised a liability of 468,000 in the opening balance sheet.
11 Previously deferred costs of 1,066,000 have been written off to align accounting policies as a result of the business combination between Informa Group plc and Taylor & Francis Group plc.
12 Note that the 2004 Financial Statements had opening balances restated on the adoption of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts, with the cost of shares now shown as a reduction to shareholders funds of 3,641,000.
This adjustment is consistent with IFRS presentation.

Under former UK GAAP these assets, comprising of properties for sale and valued at 5,924,000, were disclosed as part of property and equipment.
As at 31 December 2005 the remaining property 4,574,000 is expected to be sold within the next 12 months.
Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 83 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2005 42 Explanation of Transition to IFRS continued Explanation of Material Adjustments to the Cash Flow Statement for 2004 The major impact on the Cash Flow Statement for 2004 relates to the business combination of Informa Group plc and Taylor & Francis Group plc.
As noted previously, under IFRS the acquisition method has been used, rather than merger accounting.
This has not resulted in a change to the net cash position of the Company, but has impacted the way cash flow items have been disclosed.
The impact was a decrease in cash from operating activities by 20,692,000 to 67,492,000.
This also impacts the acquisition of subsidiaries and movements on financing amounts.
