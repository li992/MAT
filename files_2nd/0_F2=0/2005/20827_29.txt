As these syndicates are outside of the Groups management insufficient data is available to analyse the cash flows in any more detail.
The Group classifies the cash flows for the purchase and disposal of financial assets in its operating cash flows, as the purchases are funded from the Roger Taylor Richard Hextall cash flows associated with the origination of insurance contracts or the capital required to support underwriting, net of the cashflows for payments of Chairman Finance Director insurance claims.
Therefore cash generated from operations is net of 757.7 million 2004: 252.0 million being cash generated in the period that has been used to purchase financial investments.
