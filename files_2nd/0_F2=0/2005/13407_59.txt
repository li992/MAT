Statement of directors responsibilities on the company financial statements Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company for that year.
In preparing those financial statements the directors are required to: i Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
ii Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
iii State that the financial statements comply with UK GAAP.
iv Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the company financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
