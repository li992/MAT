Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
General information Premier Foods plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered ofce and principal place of business is identied on page 88.
The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries the Group, is the supply of branded and own label products, as described in note 16.
Accounting policies Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards For the first time, the annual results of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, including the accounting interpretations and guidance issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC, collectively IFRS and with the Companies Act 1985.
The date of transition to IFRS was 1 January 2004 being the start of the earliest period of comparative information.
The impact of conversion to IFRS had no cash impact.
As identied in our interim accounts for 2005, we have previously disclosed the comparative financial information of the Group as reconciled to that formerly presented under UK GAAP for the year ended and as at 31 December 2004, along with an explanation of the primary changes.
We have included this reconciliation in note 35 and further information is available on our website at www.
Since the publication of our interim results no further adjustments have been made to the information previously disclosed, other than to reect the reclassication of results of the continuing and discontinued operations of the Group.
This is explained in more detail in note 10.
In summary, the adoption of IFRS has resulted in changes to the Groups accounting policies in the following primary areas: The cessation of amortisation of acquired goodwill: Recognition and amortisation of intangible assets, primarily acquired brands: Recognition and disclosures of the Groups dened benefit pension obligations: The recognition and disclosure requirements of financial instrument accounting: and The charging of long-term employee incentive awards, principally share option costs, to income.
All changes to the Groups accounting policies have been made for the purposes of conformity with the transitional requirements of IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 1.
The Group has elected to take advantage of certain transitional provisions within IFRS 1, which offer exemptions from presenting prior year comparative information in accordance with IFRS.
The most significant of these exemptions are IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39.
These exemptions primarily affect the presentation of other operating income from financial instruments designated at fair value: fair valuation of interest rate swaps within interest payable and the analysis of financial assets and liabilities by measurement basis.
The 2004 financial instruments are recognised and disclosed in accordance with FRS 13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: disclosures.
In accordance with IFRS 1, the Group has chosen not to restate business combinations that took place prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
On 1 January 2005, the Group adopted the provisions of IAS 32 and IAS 39.
The primary effect of this change in accounting policy relates to the recognition, presentation and disclosure of the Groups interests in foreign currency derivatives and interest rate swaps and the effect of these changes have resulted in an increase of 1.8m to the Groups net liabilities at 1 January 2005.
The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benets permitting the recording of actuarial gains and losses in the statement of recognised income and expense in 2004 and 2005.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis with the exception of derivative financial instruments that are incorporated using fair value.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
On 30 October, the Group realised its interest in Typhoo Tea and related tea products businesses collectively Tea.
On 7 December, the Group also disposed of its Netherlands-based convenience businesses, Jonker Fris BV and Premier Foods BV collectively Jonker Fris.
The results from these businesses are treated as discontinued operations and are aggregated with the profit or loss on disposal of each business in arriving at the net result from discontinued operations for 2005, with 2004 restated for comparison purposes, as disclosed in note 10.
In 2004, discontinued operations also included Materne, our French spreads business..
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 3.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Premier Foods plc and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Accounting policies continued The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All inter-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Turnover Turnover comprises the invoiced value for the sale of goods net of sales rebates, discounts, value added tax and other taxes directly attributable to turnover and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Turnover is recognised when the outcome of a transaction can be measured reliably and when it is probable that the economic benets associated with the transaction will ow to the Group.
Turnover is recognised on the following basis: i Sale of goods Sales of goods are recognised as turnover on transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership, which generally coincides with the time when the merchandise is delivered to customers and title passing.
ii Interest income Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account the principal amounts outstanding and the interest rates applicable.
iii Sales rebates and discounts Sales rebates and discounts reserves are established based on managements best estimate of the amounts necessary to meet claims by the Groups customers in respect of these rebates and discounts.
The provision is made at the time of sale and released, if unutilised, after assessment that the likelihood of such a claim being made has become remote.
Segmental reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and returns different from those segments operating in other economic environments.
Segment income and expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular segment are allocated based on levels of senior management activity on the basis that this closely reects the use of the Groups resources.
Share-based payments The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated using an option-pricing model.
In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard 2 Share-based Payment IFRS 2, the resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the options.
The amount of the charge is adjusted to reect expected and actual levels of options vesting.
Foreign currency translation Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling, the Groups presentation currency, at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year.
The results of overseas subsidiaries with functional currencies other than in sterling are translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange ruling in the year.
Exchange differences arising from retranslation at year-end exchange rates of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries are recorded in reserves through the statement of recognised income and expense.
When a foreign operation is sold exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
All other exchange gains or losses are taken to the Income Statement.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are not explicitly addressed in IFRS.
Accordingly, the Group has dened exceptional items as those items of financial signicance to be disclosed separately, in order to assist in understanding the financial performance achieved and in making projections of future results.
Each of these items relate to events or circumstances that are non-recurring in nature.
Property, plant and equipment PPE Property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost.
Subsequent expenditure is added to the carrying value of the asset when it is probable that incremental future economic benets will transfer to the Group.
All other subsequent expenditure is expensed in the period it is incurred.
Differences between the cost of each item of PPE and its residual value are written off over the estimated useful life of the asset using the straight-line method.
Reviews of the estimated remaining useful lives and residual values of individual productive assets are performed annually, taking account of commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The useful lives of owned assets range from 20 to 50 years for buildings, and 3 to 35 years for vehicles, plant and equipment.
All items of PPE are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
PPE is stated at cost less depreciation after taking into account the assets useful economic life.

Accounting policies continued Business combinations and goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill arises when the fair value of the consideration for a business exceeds the fair value of the aggregate of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
On acquisition, the Group undertakes a review of the accounting policies of the business acquired to ensure compliance both with IFRS and the accounting policies of the Group.
Prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill was amortised over its estimated useful life: such amortisation ceased on 1 January 2004 in accordance with IFRS.
Prior to 1998, the Groups policy was to eliminate goodwill arising upon acquisitions against reserves.
Under IFRS 1 and International Financial Reporting Standard 3 Business Combinations IFRS 3, such goodwill remains eliminated against reserves.
Intangible assets In addition to goodwill the Group recognises the following intangible assets: Acquired intangibles Acquired trademarks, brands, recipes and similar assets that are controlled through custody or legal rights and that could be sold separately from the rest of the business are capitalised, where fair value can be reliably measured.
All of these assets are considered to have nite lives and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives that range from 20 to 30 years.
Research and development Research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Costs incurred in developing a product, typically its recipe or packaging, are charged to income in the year in which they are incurred unless the future economic benets of the project can be regarded as reasonably assured and the criteria within International Accounting Standard 38 Intangible Assets IAS 38 are met in which case they are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives.
Software development costs Assets acquired or internally developed, such as software, are capitalised when the future economic benefit is reasonably assured and the criteria within IAS 38 are met.
Software development costs are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over a range of 3 to 15 years.
Impairment The useful economic lives of intangible assets are determined, based on review of a combination of factors including the asset ownership rights acquired and the nature of the overall product life cycle.
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are also tested for impairment when an event that might affect asset values has occurred.
An impairment loss is recognised, in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying amount cannot be recovered either by selling the asset or by the discounted future earnings from operating the assets in accordance with International Accounting Standard 36 Impairment of Assets IAS 36.
Intangible assets with nite lives are subject to impairment testing on indication of impairment.
Any impairment losses are written off immediately to income.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are charged to the income statement in the year in which they are incurred.
Leases Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or fair value.
Each asset is depreciated over its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis.
Obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included under borrowings.
The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
Provisions for dilapidations are made where necessary.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease period.
Inventories Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
No interest is included but, where appropriate, cost includes production and other attributable overhead expenses as described in International Accounting Standard 2 Inventories IAS 2.
Cost is calculated on a first-in-first-out basis by reference to the invoiced value of supplies and attributable costs of bringing the inventory to its present location and condition.
All inventories are reduced to net realisable value where the estimated selling price is lower than cost.
Taxation The charge or credit for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the year and takes into account deferred taxation.
Deferred taxation is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable profit.
Deferred taxation is not provided on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than in a business combination, if at the time of the transaction there is no effect on either accounting or taxable profit or loss.
51 Premier Foods plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2.
Accounting policies continued Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Their carrying amount is reviewed at each balance sheet date on the same basis.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
It is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Employee benets Group companies provide a number of long-term employee benefit arrangements, primarily through pension schemes.
The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations.
The Group has both dened benefit and dened contribution plans.
A dened benefit plan is a pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
A dened contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays xed contributions into a separate entity.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benets relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Dened contribution plans Obligations for contributions to dened contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they fall due.
Dened benefit plans The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of dened benefit pension plans is the present value of the dened benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs.
Dened benefit obligations are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benets will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the statement of recognised income and expense in the year in which they arise.
Current service costs, past service costs, administration costs, expected return on assets and interest costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
All pension costs are recorded as a component of administrative costs.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events, it is probable that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligations and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
Where material, the Group discounts its provisions.
Contingent liabilities and contingent assets A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.
It can also be a present obligation arising from past events that is not recognised because it is not probable that outow of economic resources will be required or the amount of obligation cannot be measured reliably.
A contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
When an outow becomes probable, it is recognised as a provision.
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain events not wholly within the control of the Group.
Contingent assets are not recognised but are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements when an inow of economic benets is probable.
When inow is virtually certain, an asset is recognised.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
Trade and other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents, with original maturities at inception of less than 90 days, comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignicant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash in hand, short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and bank overdrafts.
52 Premier Foods plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2.
Accounting policies continued Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classied according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the denitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
The accounting policies adopted for specic financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are measured initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs, which include debt issuance costs and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised in the income statement over the term of the borrowings.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Trade and other payables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risk and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
Movements in fair value of foreign currency exchange derivatives are recognised within other operating income expense and those relating to interest rate swaps are recorded in interest payable and other financial charges.
Hedge accounting has not been adopted therefore the change in fair value is recognised directly in the income statement as it arises.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The application of judgement is fundamental to the compilation of a set of financial statements, some of which relates to transactions or balances that are of greater signicance than others.
The primary area in which this affects the Group is noted below: Pensions The present value of the Groups pension obligations depends on a number of actuarial assumptions.
The primary assumptions used include the expected long-term rate of return on invested funds, the discount rate applicable to scheme liabilities, the long-term rate of ination and estimates of the mortality applicable to scheme members.
At each reporting date, and on a continuing basis, the Group reviews the macro-economic and company specic factors inuencing each of these assumptions, based on professional advice, in order to record the Groups ongoing commitment and obligation to dened benefit schemes in accordance with IFRS.
The Group is aware of, and alert to, the need to inform the Pensions Regulator to the extent that the Group is involved in any corporate activity that affects the rights of pension scheme members and the carrying value of the pension schemes.
Each of the underlying assumptions is set out in more detail in note 24.
Segmental analysis The results below for the year ended 31 December 2005 are divided into continuing and discontinued operations, with the two continuing segments described as Grocery and Fresh Produce.
Following the disposal of our Tea business, within Grocery we now refer to two product groupings, namely Convenience Foods, Pickles, Sauces and Meat-Free which now incorporates Quorn and Cauldron products and Spreads, Desserts and Beverages.
Results for the Tea business and Jonker Fris are presented as discontinued operations.
Each of these segments primarily supplies the United Kingdom market, although we also supply certain products to mainland Europe and the United States.
Inter-segment transfers or transactions are entered into under the same terms and conditions that would be available to unrelated third parties.
These segments are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
The segment results for the years ended 31 December 2005 and 2004 are as follows: 53 Premier Foods plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 4.

Following the acquisition, the product range continued to be produced at the Krafts factory in Banbury under a series of transitional arrangements.
These arrangements were extended to the end of the year following the decision to ensure the continuity of supply to our customers during the heavy pre-Christmas trading season for Birds.
For the purposes of comparability, we have presented the additional cost of sourcing production from Kraft as exceptional costs.
55 Premier Foods plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 5.
Exceptional items continued b MBM restructuring costs In the period to 31 December 2005, as part of our ongoing commitment to manufacturing efficiency, we incurred restructuring costs and stock write-offs relating to rationalisation of operations within the Fresh Produce segment.
This has been part of an ongoing process, which began in the second half of 2004 and is the result of a significant loss of contract business.
c Net insurance recovery on Bury St Edmunds On 27 October 2004, the Group suffered a serious re at its Bury St Edmunds factory, the primary manufacturing site for pickles and sauces.
Subsequently, the factory has been rebuilt and the benefit of replacing depreciated assets with new capital investment has been credited as exceptional income, net of the impact of writing off the damaged assets.
d Sudan 1 On 18 February 2005, the Food Standards Agency initiated the recall of a number of products that had been identied as being contaminated with a dye, Sudan 1, which is not authorised for use in food products.
The dye was traced to a batch of chilli powder supplied to the Group and in its manufacture of Worcester sauce.
The Group used the Worcester sauce in three other products and supplied Worcester sauce to a number of retail and food ingredient customers.
Claims against the Company by customers relating to the recall are being dealt with by our insurers and we continue to believe we have no material financial exposure in this respect.
During the course of the recall the Group incurred a number of legal and other expenses involved in the handling of the recall.
These are the subject of a claim against the supplier of the contaminated chilli powder and its insurers.
In case such recovery is unsuccessful the Group has provided in full for these costs and has recorded an exceptional cost of 2.4m in relation to this matter.
e IPO In 2004, the Companys initial public offering IPO resulted in expense totalling 15.0m for continuing operations.
This expense included the cash cancellation of existing share options, the cash cancellation of 30% of senior managements share options and the cost of issue of new 1 pence ordinary share options, exercisable one year after the IPO.
We also incurred a further 3.1m of costs, attributable to the IPO, of which 0.9m were charged in 2005. f Restructuring and other costs These primarily relate to the restructuring of the production and administration facilities in the UK grocery business.
g Property disposal This relates to the sale of a surplus property in the West Midlands.
This property was not used in our operations.
For the year ended 31 December 2004, exceptional items relating to the Tea and Jonker Fris businesses have been restated and reclassied to discontinued operations.

The only dilutive potential ordinary shares of the Company are share options.
A calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options.
The number of shares used to calculate ordinary earnings per share is compared below with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.
No adjustment is made to earnings in calculating undiluted and diluted earnings per share.

The impairment loss in 2004 related to our Fresh Produce segment.
An amount of 0.5m 2004: nil was recognised as accelerated depreciation for plant and equipment that had no further useful economic life.
Following our transition to IFRS, the Group conducted a review of useful economic lives and residual values of its plant and equipment using independent valuation advice.
As a consequence, we have revised the weighted average useful lives of our assets, with the effect of reducing our current year and ongoing depreciation charge by 3.0m3.6m annually.

Goodwill continued Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, on acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
A summary of the goodwill by CGU is presented below: 2005 2004 m m Grocery Ambrosia 54.8 54.8 Nestl 73.6 73.6 Marlow 76.9 Birds 38.4 Cauldron 21.3 Gedneys 2.1 Other 0.6 1.0 Net carrying value of goodwill 267.7 129.4 Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Conrmation of the CGUs carrying values is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for value-in-use calculations are those relating to discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Discount rates are estimated using pre-tax rates based on the weighted average cost of capital WACC of the Group.
Given that the products are closely related and share similar risks and rates of return, consistent Group discount rates are used for all CGUs.
The growth rate is set below industry growth forecasts to be conservative.
Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
All projections are based on information approved by management in respect of the initial five years cash ows.
Subsequent cash ows are increased in line with historic UK GDP of 2% to 2.25%.
Assumptions are based upon events in prior periods as adjusted for expected developments in the following year with reference to market conditions.
All turnover and costs are taken into account and an estimate of capital expenditure required to maintain these cash ows is also made.
As at 31 December 2005 the rate used to discount the forecasted cash ows was 7.75% 2004: 7.94%.
There was no evidence of impairment from the reviews performed in 2004 or 2005.

Cash and bank deposits and short-term borrowings included in the balance sheet reect the anticipated level at which the Group will offset cash and overdrafts and legal rights to such offset in accordance with IAS 32. a Senior Term Credit Facility and Revolving Credit Facility Arrangement 2005 On 6 June 2005, the Group renanced and entered into a new Term and Revolving Credit Facility agreement.
This was arranged by BNP Paribas, J. P. Morgan plc, Lloyds TSB Bank plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc as lead arrangers and underwriters and Lloyds TSB Bank plc as facility agent and security trustee.
These facilities were subsequently syndicated to a further 23 financial institutions.
The Senior Term Credit Facility comprises 325.0m.
The Revolving Credit Facility is a multi-currency revolving credit facility of up to 455.0m or its equivalent in other currencies.
The final maturity date of the above arrangements is 6 June 2010. b Senior Credit Facility and Acquisition Facility Arrangement 2004 The facilities in place prior to 6 June 2005 included a Senior Credit Facility and an Acquisition Facility agreement with J. P. Morgan plc as arranger, JPMorgan Chase Bank as underwriter and with J. P. Morgan Europe Limited as agent and security trustee.
Under the Senior Credit Facility, a syndicate of financial institutions made 380.0m of credit facilities available to the Group.
The Senior Credit Facility comprised 175.8m of Term A facilities and 204.2m of Term B facilities.
In addition a multi-currency revolving credit facility of 200.0m or its equivalent in other currencies was available.
These facilities were repaid on 6 June 2005.
64 Premier Foods plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 20.
Bank and other borrowings continued c Loan notes As part of the acquisition arrangement of Marlow Foods Holdings Limited, on 6 June 2005, the Group entered into deferred consideration arrangements with certain individuals.
This resulted in loan notes being issued to the Group.
These notes incur interest at six month LIBOR rate and mature in 2008.
Financial instruments The Group is subject to the risks arising from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency.
The Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage these risks.
The managing of these risks, along with the day-to-day managing of treasury activities is centralised and performed by the Group Treasury function.
The policy framework governing the managing of these risks is dened by the Treasury Committee which itself is a sub-committee appointed by the Directors.
These policies are reviewed and approved by the Directors annually.
The framework for managing of these risks is incorporated into a policies and procedures manual.
The Group also enters into contracts with suppliers for its principal raw material requirements, some of which are considered commodities.
These contracts are part of the Groups normal purchasing activities and always result in receipt of raw materials.
Fair value The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets such as publicly traded derivatives is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts is estimated by calculating the present value using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of foreign exchange option contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date using the Garman Kohlhagen model.
Where the model is unable to revalue the options, valuations are sought from reliable third parties.
For the purposes of valuing trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables, the amounts, paid, payable, received or receivable are assumed to approximate fair value.
For disclosure purposes the fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash ows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Market risk Foreign exchange risk The Groups functional and presentation currency is pounds sterling although some transactions are executed in non-sterling currencies, including Euros, US dollars, Swiss Francs and Swedish Krona.
The transactional amounts realised or settled are therefore subject to the effect of movements in these currencies against the pound.
Management of these exposures is centralised and managed by the Groups Treasury Function.
It is the Groups policy to manage the exposures arising using forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency options.
Hedge accounting is not sought for these transactions.
Although the Group generates some of its profits in non-sterling currencies and has assets in non-sterling jurisdictions, the translation exposure resulting from these profits and overseas net assets is not considered material and is currently not hedged.
This matter is reviewed regularly by the Treasury Committee.
Price risk The Group is not exposed to any significant equity or commodity price risks.
The Group does not trade in commodities.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with high-credit quality financial institutions.
Cash and bank deposits and bank overdrafts included in the balance sheet reect the anticipated level at which the Group will offset cash and overdrafts and legal rights to such offset in accordance with the IAS 32.
Trade receivables are due principally from major grocery retailers, however, it is the Groups policy to insure trade debt.
Liquidity risk The Group has negotiated facilities with its bankers that provide sufficient headroom to ensure liquidity and continuity of funding.
It has sufficient undrawn banking facilities and reserve borrowing capacity.
The Group tends to experience significant uctuations in its short-term borrowing position due to seasonal factors: however, available revolving credit facilities are set at a level sufficient to meet the projected peak borrowing requirements.
Cash ow and interest rate risk The Group borrows principally in pounds sterling at oating rates of interest and seeks to mitigate the effect of adverse movements in interest rates by entering into derivative financial instruments that reduce the level of exposure to oating rates.
The Group actively monitors its interest rate exposure, since the high level of debt makes its profitability sensitive to movements in interest rates.
The level of xed capped debt is dened in the Group Treasury policy and procedures.
Hedge accounting for interest rate swaps has not been adopted.
Short-term receivables and payables Short-term trade and other receivables and payables have been excluded from the interest rate risk analysis as they are interest free and given their short maturity.

Fixed rate financial liabilities Weighted average Weighted average period for which interest rate rate is xed % years Currency sterling At 31 December 2005 4.65 3.49 At 31 December 2004 4.93 2.88 The weighted average interest rates for xed rate liabilities excludes the borrowing margin as the derivative instruments used to x the interest rates are not allocated specically against the Term and Revolving credit facilities.
The pricing basis for all oating rate borrowings is LIBOR as adjusted by agreed interest margins.
If default occurs such as a breach of financial covenant the interest margin will immediately rise to 1.20% until the default has been corrected.
The analysis of average interest rates and years to maturity on xed rate debt is stated after adjusting for interest rate swaps.
The oating rates applicable to interest rate swaps are repriced quarterly based on the prevailing market rate at the reset date.
The interest rate swaps are scheduled to mature on 19 November 2007 notional principal of 180m and 30 September 2009 notional principal of 110m.
A forward starting swap has also been entered into as at 31 December 2005 which commences on 19 November 2007 notional principal of 140m and is scheduled to mature on 30 September 2009.
Interest under these swaps is payable at xed interest rate varying from 4.2% to 4.9% per annum.

Forward contracts are not classied as effective hedges.
As a result the movement in the fair value of 0.9m 2004: nil has been credited to the income statement in the year.
Interest rate swaps are marked to market using prevailing market prices.
Interest rate swaps are not designated for hedge accounting.
As a result the movement in the fair value of 1.1m 2004: nil has been charged to the income statement in the year.
Bank loans, loan notes and interest payable Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash ows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash ows, discounted at market interest rates for similar lease agreements.
Trade and other receivables payables The carrying value of receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year is deemed to reect the fair value given their short maturity.
The fair value of non-current receivables payables are also considered to be the same as the carrying value due to the size and nature of the balances involved.

For the year-end 31 December 2005, the average effective borrowing rate was 6.5%.
Interest rates are xed at the contract date, and thus expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
All leases are on a xed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates their carrying value.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors title to the leased assets.

Retirement benefit obligations Dened benefit schemes Most Group companies participate in the Premier Foods Pension Scheme the PFPS, the principal funded dened benefit scheme operated by the Group.
The Group also operates a smaller funded dened benefit scheme, the Premier Ambient Products Pension Scheme the PAPPS for employees in the Ambrosia business.
Under the schemes, employees are entitled to retirement benets varying as a percentage of final salary on retirement.
No unfunded post-retirement benets exist.
The assets of both schemes are held by the trustees and are independent of the Groups nances.
The schemes invest through investment managers, appointed by the trustees, in UK and European equities and in investment products comprising a broad range of assets.
For the purposes of these financial statements pension costs presented are calculated by independent qualied actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
As at 31 December 2005, the Group recognised net retirement benefit obligations of 84.5m 2004: 65.6m and assets of 0.1m 2004: 0.5m in respect of PFPS and PAPPS respectively.
The gures below are consolidated to include PFPS and PAPPS.
At the balance sheet date, the principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: 2005 2004 Discount rate 5.00% 5.50% Expected salary increases 3.75% 3.50% Future pension increases 2.75% 2.50% Ination 2.75% 2.50% Average expected remaining life of a 65-year-old male years 15 16 The mortality assumptions used is slightly below the national average because it reects the socio-economic prole of the membership and the schemes actual and anticipated mortality experience.
The fair values of plan assets and the expected rates of return on assets were: Expected Expected rate of return Market value rate of return Market value 2005 2005 2004 2004 Assets % m % m Equities 8.00% 160.8 8.50% 136.8 Insight targeted return 6.75% 66.0 7.70% 166.4 ML targeted return 7.75% 103.8 Cash and other 4.50% 3.9 Total 7.63% 334.5 8.06% 303.2 At the balance sheet date, the actual distribution of assets held within targeted return investments was: 2005 2004 Cash Equities Total Cash Equities Total m m m m m m Insight targeted return 66.0 66.0 166.4 166.4 MLtargetedreturn 60.243.6103.8 The expected return on pension scheme assets is based on the long-term investment strategy set out in the Schemes Statement of Investment Principles at the start of the year.
In 2005, the expected return was calculated using the equity return and targeted investment return assumptions of 8.5% and 7.7% respectively.
As at 31 December 2004, 99.9m was temporarily held as cash with an expected return of 8.5%, pending re-investment in equity markets.
The expected return on the majority of the remaining cash, of 66.5m, was the targeted return benchmark in place of 6.5% net of fees.
The actual rate of return on plan assets was 13.4% 2004: 10.8%.
The plan assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet arising from the Groups obligations in respect of its dened benefit schemes are as follows: 2005 2004 m m Present value of funded obligations 418.9 368.3 Fair value of plan assets 334.5 303.2 deficit in scheme 84.4 65.1 71 Premier Foods plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 24.

Share capital continued Share option schemes In 2004, the Company had an Executive Share Option Scheme for certain senior executives and key individuals.
The employees involved in the scheme hold options to subscribe for up to 5.6 million ordinary shares of 1 pence each between 2005 and 2014 at prices ranging between 1 pence per ordinary share and 215 pence per ordinary share.
The number of shares subject to options, the periods in which they were granted and the periods in which they may be exercised are given below.
In 2005, the Company introduced two new schemes: 1.
A Savings Related Share Option Scheme for employees.
The employees involved in the scheme have the right to subscribe for up to 1.3 million ordinary shares at 231 pence per ordinary share.
These options are equity settled, have a maximum term of 3.5 years and vest only if employees remain in employment to the vesting date or are deemed a good leaver.
A Long-Term Incentive Plan for directors and senior management.
The individuals involved in the scheme have the right to subscribe for up to 0.9 million ordinary shares at 1 pence per ordinary share.
These options are equity-settled and have a maximum term of 10 years.
The vesting condition attached to the Groups long-term incentive plan arrangements are explained in detail in the directors remuneration report on pages 38 to 44.
A small number of shadow awards have been made to senior management of the Group.

The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 86 pence 2004: 56 pence.
This was determined using a closed-form approach as a proxy for a stochastic Monte Carlo valuation model except for the Savings Related Share Option Scheme where a Black-Scholes model was used.
The significant inputs into the model were: 2005 2004 Weighted average share price pence 278 215 Annual risk-free interest rate % 5 5 Expected dividend % 5-6 6 Expected option life years 4-5 5 Expected volatility % 25-40 40 Volatility is measured using the standard deviation of expected share price return and is based on statistical analysis of daily share prices for public companies over the last three years.
In 2005, the Group recognised expense of 1.1m 2004: 0.2m in respect of equity-settled share based payments in accordance with IFRS 2.
In 2004, an additional 6.3m was recognised in respect of certain share-options under the Executive Share Option Scheme, determined based on their intrinsic value as allowed under the transitional provisions of IFRS 2, as they were vested before 1 January 2005.

An initial allocation of fair value to the acquired assets and liabilities of Marlow Foods has also been performed, although adjustments of classication nature, including those relating to deferred taxes, are anticipated.
The goodwill arising on acquisition is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the acquired businesses and the future operating synergies expected to arise from the combination.
For Cauldron, Monument and the Marlow acquisitions the initial accounting for the business combinations is determined provisionally.
A full review is being undertaken, to determine fair values but these remain to be completed at the balance sheet date.
Subsequent to the acquisition of Marlow, Marlow received an assessment in respect of PAYE and NIC assessed on deemed compensation to the former owners of Marlow on the disposal of their shares.
The directors of the Group believe that it is not probable that the assessment will give rise to any liability.
No reliable estimate of the fair value of any potential exposure is possible at the date of this report.
The case will be reviewed by the Group on a regular basis.
For the purposes of its provisional acquisition accounting, the Group has not attributed any fair value to the claim on this basis.

Contingencies Sudan 1 Product Recall On 18 February 2005, the Food Standards Agency initiated a recall of a number of products, which had been identied as possibly being contaminated with a dye Sudan 1 not authorised for use in food products.
