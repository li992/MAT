From the date of acquisition BDML has contributed 1.1m to the net profit after tax of the Group, had the combination taken place at the beginning of the year the profit after tax of the Group would have been 107.9m and the revenue from continuing operations would have been 1,443.7m.
Included within goodwill on acquisition are certain intangibles that were not separable from the acquiree and could not be measured, these include customer loyalty and the assembled workforce.
The acquisition of BDML includes insurance debtors subject to a securitisation agreement.
The purpose of this arrangement is to securitise customer receivables, derived through the provision of instalment credit facilities to insurance customers of the company.
The company sells said receivables, with no immediate effect on the P&L, for cash to a third party Gresham in this case.
Gresham take on the rights and responsibilites of these receivables such that the terms of this agreement dictate that Gresham has no recourse to BDML beyond 14% of the total receivable securitised.
Under UK GAAP, the substance of this arrangement was disclosed as linked presentation under the current assets section of the balance sheet, without appearing in the nancing section of the balance sheet.
The Groups transition to IFRS has necessitated different disclosure, the impact of which is to reect on BDMLs opening balance sheet an increase in the Groups receivables of 37.1m adding 26.8m of securitised asset nancing.
The respective balances of this arrangement at 31 December 2005 were 37.9m to receivables and 28.2m to securitised asset nancing.
