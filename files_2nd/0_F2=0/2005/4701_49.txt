Counterparties for such transactions entered into during the year have a long term credit rating of A or better.
The group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties, together with their credit ratings, and, by policy, limits the amount of agreements or contracts it enters into with any one party.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the credit risk arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is generally estimated by the fair value of contracts with a positive value.
Cash at bank and liquid resources principally comprise money market deposits, commercial paper and investments.
The investments are with counterparties having strong credit ratings.
At 30 June 2005, approximately 15% and 42% of the groups cash at bank and liquid resources of 817 million were invested with United Kingdom and United States based counterparties, respectively.
At 30 June 2005, approximately 16% and 23% of the groups trade debtors of 1,244 million were due from United Kingdom and United States based counterparties, respectively.
