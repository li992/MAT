The cash and cash equivalents, which are all at floating rates, yield interest based principally on short-term inter-bank rates principally LIBOR applicable to periods of three months or less.
Financial Instruments Treasury risk management policies The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international business.
Derivative financial instruments are utilised by the Group to lower funding costs, to diversify sources of funding, to alter interest rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities or to achieve greater certainty of future costs.
These instruments are entered into in accordance with policies approved by the Board of Directors and are subject to regular review and audit.
Other than expressly stated, the policies set out below also apply to prior years.
Substantially all derivative financial instruments that are entered into hedge specifically identified actual or anticipated transactions: movements in their fair value are highly negatively correlated with movements in the fair value of the transactions being hedged.
The terms of the hedging instrument are designed to match the terms of the hedged transaction.
Such anticipated transactions are all in the normal course of business and the Group is of the opinion that it is highly probable that they will occur.
However some transactions do not always meet the stringent conditions prescribed by IAS 39 to obtain hedge accounting.
a Liquidity Risk The Group seeks to achieve a balance between certainty of funding, even at difficult times for the markets or the Group, and a flexible, cost-effective borrowings structure.
The policy, therefore, seeks to ensure that at a minimum all projected net borrowing needs are covered by committed facilities.
Also, the objective for debt maturities is to ensure that the amount of debt maturing in any one year is not beyond the Group's means to repay and refinance.
To this end the policy provides that at least 75% of year-end net debt should have a maturity of one year or more and at least 50%, three years or more.
Committed but undrawn facilities are taken into account for this test.
126 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts 2005 b Interest Rate Risk The Group has an exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and manages these by the use of interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and interest rate caps.
The objectives for the mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings are set to reduce the impact of an upward change in interest rates while enabling benefits to be enjoyed if interest rates fall.
Thus the policy sets minimum and maximum levels of the total of net debt and preferred securities permitted to be at fixed rates in various time bands, ranging from 50% to 100% for the period up to six months, to 0% to 30% when over five years.
84% was at fixed rates of interest at year end 2004: 85%, but the year-end level of total debt is around 100 million lower than the annual average.
c Currency Risk The Group operates internationally giving rise to exposure from changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly the US dollar.
The Group does not hedge translation exposure and earnings because the benefit obtained from such hedging can only be temporary.
The Group seeks to relate the structure of borrowings to the trading cash flows that service them and the Group's policy is to maintain broadly similar fixed charge cover ratios for each currency bloc.
Also, the fixed charge cover ratio for any currency bloc may not fall below two times in any calendar year.
This is achieved by raising funds in different currencies and through the use of hedging instruments such as swaps.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures arising from its international trade.
The Group's policy is to take forward cover for all forecasted receipts and payments for as far ahead as the pricing structures are committed, subject to a minimum of three months' cover.
The Group makes use of the forward foreign exchange markets to hedge its exposures.
While there are exchange control restrictions which affect the ability of certain of the Group's subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Group, the operations affected by such restrictions are not material to the Group as a whole and the Group does not believe such restrictions have had or will have any material adverse impact on the Group as a whole or the ability of the Group to meet its cash flow requirements.
d Commodity Risk In respect of commodities the Group enters into forward and futures contracts for cocoa, sugar and aluminium in order to provide a stable cost base for marketing finished products.
The use of futures contracts enables the Group to obtain the benefit of guaranteed contract performance on firm priced contracts offered by the exchanges and their clearing houses.
e Credit Risk The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but it does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given the Group's policy of selecting only counterparties with high credit ratings.
The exposure to credit loss of liquid assets is equivalent to the carrying value on the balance sheet.
The maximum credit exposure of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date.
Counterparties to financial instruments are limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has ISDA Master Agreements with most of its counterparties to financial derivatives, which permits net settlement of assets and liabilities in certain circumstances, thereby reducing the Group's credit exposure to individual counterparties.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any single financial institution.
There were no significant concentrations of credit exposure at the year-end.
At the year-end, the Group had $128 million notional value worth of currency swaps with a financial institution with a credit quality lower than that permitted under Group Policy.
$3.3 million cash collateral has been obtained from the counterparty as security to mitigate against the higher credit risk.
The book value of the cash collateral is equal to its fair value.
There were no significant concentrations of credit exposure at year-end.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group's customer base being large and unrelated.
Management therefore believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of normal provision for doubtful receivables.
The Group is exposed to 4,064 million in credit exposure on financial guarantees issued in respect of Group corporate borrowings and certain subsidiary undertakings which represents the Groups maximum credit exposure arising from guarantees.
Refer to Note 34 on Commitments and Contingencies for further details.

Financial Instruments continued Terms and conditions of Financial Instruments f Foreign Currency Derivatives The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposures that arise on sales denominated in foreign currencies.
At the year-end, the Group held contracts to exchange the following foreign currency notional amounts against Sterling: Foreign exchange trades against 2005 Current Non-current $ MXN Other $ MXN Other m m m m m m m m Purchase 289 702 29 13 Sale 109 543 240 98 6 Total equivalent notional 180 159 240 69 13 6 Foreign exchange trades against $ 2005 Current Non-current CAD AUD Other CAD AUD Other m m m m m m m m Purchase 109 18 32 67 4 Sale 159 47 11 24 18 Total equivalent notional 50 29 21 43 14 At 1 January 2006 the Group had approximately 175 million forward transactions relating to currencies other than US dollars or Sterling maturing in 2006 and 2 million maturing in 2007.
The majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts mature within 12 months.
The maximum maturity of forward exchange contracts is June 2007.

128 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts 2005 g Interest rate Derivatives The Group uses a combination of short-term and long-term cross currency and interest rate swaps to manage the currency and interest rate profile of its borrowings.
Details of the fixed rate element of the swap portfolio are shown in the table below: Weighted Maturing in Maturing Maturing Maturing Maturing Notional average less than in the in the in the in the After principal interest rate one year second year third year fourth year fifth year five years m %mmmmmm Currency Instrument Receive Fixed 250 5.40 150 100 Euro Receive Fixed 21 3.86 21 Pay Fixed 137 3.72 137 $ Receive Fixed 1,046 2.96 581 465 Pay Fixed 1,454 3.62 814 640 Other Receive Fixed 155 2.46 58 37 60 Pay Fixed 122 5.31 122 Forward Start Pay Fixed 64 5.85 64 On swaps where fixed rates of interest are payable, the Group receives interest at floating rates of three months or six month LIBOR rates or local equivalent.
On swaps where fixed rates of interest are received, the Group pays interest at floating rates set at three month or six month LIBOR plus an average margin of 0.59%.
The differential to be paid or received on the current leg of swap agreements is accrued as interest rates change and is recognised within finance costs in the periods that they arise over the lives of the respective agreements.
The remaining cash flows to maturity of each swap are discounted at current market rates to determine the fair value of swap agreements at year-end.
h Commodities In respect of commodities the Group enters into forward and futures contracts for cocoa, sugar and aluminium in order to provide a stable cost base for marketing finished products.
The Group held the following commodity futures contracts at 1 January 2006: 2005 2004 Fair value Fair value m m Commodities asset 13 5 Commodities liabilities 1 7 Total equivalent notional 12 2 Commodity futures contracts were held in Sterling and US dollars.
The majority of commodities contracts mature within one year.
The notional amount of cover decreased from 273,371 metric tonnes in 2004 to 161,574 metric tonnes in 2005.
The commodities futures contracts held by the Group at the year-end exposes the Group to adverse movements in cash flow and gains or losses due to the market risk arising from changes in prices for sugar, cocoa and aluminium traded on the LIFFE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, LME London Metals Exchange and CSCE Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, Inc.
Applying a reasonable adverse movement in commodity prices to the Groups net commodity positions held at year end would result in a decrease in fair value of 6.8 million 2004: 11.6 million.
The price sensitivity applied in this case is estimated based on an absolute average of historical monthly changes in prices in the Groups commodities over a two year period.
Stocks, priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases are not included in the calculations of the sensitivity analysis.
This method of analysis is used to assess and mitigate risk and should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
Actual results and market conditions in the future may be materially different from the projection in this note and changes in the instruments held and in the commodities markets in which the Group operates could cause losses to exceed the amounts projected.
i Embedded Derivatives The Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set out in the standard.
As at 1 January 2006, the fair value of embedded derivatives was an asset of 1.9 million.
This relates to various contracts for sugar, sweeteners and plastics in US dollars, with maturities of between one and five years.
Amounts recorded in the Income Statement are included within those disclosed in Note 10 to the Financial Statements.
Report & Accounts 2005 Cadbury Schweppes 129 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 28.
Financial Instruments continued f Fair values and sensitivity analysis Fair values of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities: The fair values for public debt are based on quoted market prices.
For cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and short-term loans and receivables with a maturity of less than one year the book values approximate the fair value because of their short-term nature.
For non-public long-term loans and receivables, fair values are estimated by discounting future contractual cash flows to net present values using at the current market interest rates available to the Group for similar financial instruments as at year end.
The table below contains fair values of debt instruments based on clean prices excluding accrued interest.

The fair values of derivative instruments are based on the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay if the transaction was terminated.
Financial derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value being recognised immediately in the income statement, except when the derivative has been designated as part of an effective cash flow hedge in which case up to all the gains and losses could be deferred into equity until the hedged transaction affects the income statement.
