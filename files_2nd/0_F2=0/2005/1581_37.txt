Acquisition of subsidiaries a Verity, Inc. On 29 December 2005 the group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Verity, Inc. for cash consideration of $495.7 million.
Verity is a leading provider of software solutions for the enterprise search market and the business process management market.
This transaction has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting.
Managements preliminary allocation has attributed a value of $50 million to purchased intangibles comprising purchased technology, customer relationships and brand names.

Had Veritys results for the period from 1 January 2005 through 29 December 2005 been included in the companys results for the year ended 31 December 2005 then group revenues for 2005 would theoretically have increased by $138.5 million and net profit increased by $0.5 million.
The foregoing is a theoretical calculation adding Veritys historical pre-acquisition results to the companys 2005 results.
The calculation does not give effect to any positive or negative effects on Verity or the company as a result of the acquisition, or any other factors that may have affected either companys results during those periods, and should not be relied upon as indicative of anything other than a pro forma addition of Veritys historical results to the companys results, which are not necessarily indicative of future results.

The calculation does not give effect to any positive or negative effects on etalk or the company as a result of the acquisition, or any other factors that may have affected either companys results during those periods, and should not be relied upon as indicative of anything other than a pro forma addition of etalks historical results to the companys results, which are not necessarily indicative of future results.
c Stand-alone impact of Verity and etalk acquisitions It is not practicable to determine the effect of the etalk acquisition for the period from acquisition to the end of the financial year.
The companys core products and those of the acquired entity have been integrated and the operations merged such that it is not practicable to determine the portion of the result that specifically relates to etalk on a stand-alone basis.
During the period from acquisition Verity generated stand-alone revenues of $1.15 million, and incurred normal operating costs of $0.9m and a non-recurring restructuring cost of $5.0m.
