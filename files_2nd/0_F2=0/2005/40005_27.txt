The two longer dated bonds were exchanged into a new unsecured issue bearing a coupon of 5.75 per cent with a maturity date of 2035.
Those investors unable to hold the new bonds because of duration mismatches or because of the unsecured nature of the new bonds were offered a cash-out alternative whereby the company bought back the new bonds for redemption.
The proposals were voted on at bondholders EGMs on 8 June 2005 and as over 75 per cent of all holders of each issue voted in favour of the proposals, they were adopted in full and the old bonds were effectively redeemed on 21 June 2005 and were replaced with the following new debt: 200 million 5.5 per cent Euro Bond 2018 100 million 5.75 per cent Euro Bond 2035 146 million of new bank line drawings at circa 5 per cent subsequently refinanced through a new 2020 bond at a coupon of 5.625 per cent.
The cost of the exchange reflecting the mark-to-market fair value of the old bonds plus the 4.9 million incentive fee results in a one-off tax deductible finance charge of 126.0 million.
However, future cash interest charges should be reduced by circa 10.0 million per annum.
The interest capitalised rates for 2005 were: UK 8 per cent for the six months to 30 June 2005 and 6.5 per cent for the remainder of the year 2004: 8 per cent for the year, US 6.68 per cent 2004: 5.62 per cent, and in Europe at rates ranging from 3.0 per cent to 4.5 per cent 2004: 3.0 to 4.5 per cent.
Interest is capitalised gross of tax relief.
The net interest cost of joint ventures and associate amounting to 3.2 million 2004: 2.6 million were previously included in the above total of interest cost under UK GAAP.
This net interest is now shown within the net profit from joint ventures and associate as required by IFRS.
Interest on the preference shares was previously classified as preference dividend in the income statement.

No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associate and joint ventures.
In the event of their remittance to the UK, no net UK tax is expected to be payable.

The directors consider that this adjusted figure gives a more meaningful comparison for the periods shown in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax on investment and development properties has been excluded from the adjusted calculation as the Group has no plans to sell a significant proportion of its investment and development properties.
Net assets per share are calculated using the equity shareholders funds of 2,440.4 million 2004: 2,029.1 million.
Adjusted net assets per share have been calculated on the same number of shares but shareholders funds exclude the deferred tax liability of 649.2 million 2004: 457.3 million as it is the opinion of the directors that deferred tax on capital allowances and valuation surplus in relation to investment properties is unlikely to crystallise materially in practice.

Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments, currency borrowings and cross currency swaps are used to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Credit Risk Creditworthiness evaluations are performed on all potential customers looking to enter into lease or pre-lease agreements with the Group.
In certain cases the Group will require collateral to support these lease obligations.
This might be in the form of a cash rental security deposit, parent company guarantee or a bank rental guarantee.
Investments are permitted in bank deposits or CDs, liquidity funds and corporate commercial paper.
The counterparties must have a short term credit rating of at least A1 P1 or AAA in the case of investments in liquidity funds.
Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are with counterparties with whom the Group has a signed ISDA agreement as well as having good investment grade credit ratings.
Given their high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
100 Slough Estates plc Annual Report 2005 30.
Financial instruments and fair values continued Interest rate risk which relates to interest bearing liabilities and assets.
Hedging Effective 25 January 2006 the Group Board sanctioned a change to the Group Policy on interest rate exposure management.
Up to that point at least 70 per cent of the Groups debt portfolio had to be at a fixed or capped collared rate of interest.
However, due to the increased size of the debt portfolio this minimum level has been increased to at least 85 per cent to reduce the aggregate exposure to movements in variable interest rates.
As at 31 December 2005, 87 per cent 2004: 81 per cent of the Groups debt including derivatives attracted a fixed rate of interest at a weighted average rate of 6.19 per cent 2004: 7.09 per cent.
Much of this debt was in the form of fixed rate debt issues raised through Sterling Eurobonds or US Dollar Private Placements.
Such fixed rate debt issues are held at amortised cost.
Interest rate swaps, collars and forward rate agreements are also used to convert variable rate bank debt to fixed rate debt.
The 13 per cent of debt attracting a variable rate of interest brought the weighted average interest cost down to 5.81 per cent 2004: 6.41 per cent.
A one percentage point movement in interest rates in the same direction across all currencies in which the Group borrows on average for a complete year would change the Groups pre-tax profit by - 2.9 million.
The Group has decided not to elect to hedge account its interest rate derivatives portfolio.
Therefore, movements in the fair value of the portfolio are taken to the income statement through the interest line.
Foreign currency risk Due to its nature of business the Group has no cross border trade transactions therefore foreign exchange transaction exposure is negligible.
However, it does have operations located overseas which transact business in the domestic currency of where the businesses are located mostly in the US Dollar & Euros.
The Groups main currency exposure therefore is the translation risk associated with converting net currency assets back into sterling in the Group consolidated accounts at each balance sheet date.
The Policy on translation exposure is that between 75 per cent 100 per cent of currency denominated assets excluding unrealised valuation surpluses must be financed by liabilities in the same currency.
At year end 2005 net assets exposed excluding unrealised valuation surpluses were 260.7 million.
This increases to 460.9 million when unrealised surpluses are included.
Therefore a 10 per cent movement in the value of sterling in the same direction across all currencies in which the Group operates would change net assets by - 46.0 million or by 1.44 per cent.
However, it should be noted that sterling rarely moves in value in the same direction against the US dollar and the Euro.
The Group has no specific policy on hedging profit translation exposure as the effects of currency movements have had minimal effect on recurring investment property income net of currency interest costs.
Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries US$ 371.6 million & EUR 54.2 million 2004 US$121.6 million & EUR51.2 million of the Groups UK domiciled foreign currency denominated loans are designated as hedges against part of the Groups investment in its subsidiaries in Europe and US.
The carrying amount of the loans at 31 December 2005 was 253.2 million 2004: 99.7 million.
A foreign exchange loss of 12.8 million 2004 gain of 4 million was recognised in equity on translation of the loans to sterling.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of all of these losses as it is expected that future profits will be available.
The Group also has capital tax losses of 45.3 million 2004: 48.3 million which can only be utilised against future profits from the sale of investment properties.
In accordance with IAS 12 these losses give rise to a deferred tax asset which is offset against the deferred tax liability.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed profits of subsidiaries and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was nil 2004: nil.
No liability has been recognised because the Group is in a position to control the distribution of these profits and this is unlikely in the foreseeable future.

Retirement benefit schemes continued Defined benefit schemes The Group has two defined benefit schemes in the UK, the Slough Estates 1957 Pension Scheme the Slough scheme and the Bilton Group Pension Scheme the Bilton scheme.
Their assets are held by trustees separately from the assets of the employer.
Contributions to the schemes, which are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method of calculation, are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
The Bilton scheme has been closed to new members since 2003.
The Slough scheme was closed to new members in October 2005.
The valuation of the Slough and Bilton schemes has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2004 for Slough and 5 April 2004 for Bilton and updated by Hewitts in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2005.
The assets of both schemes are stated at their market value at 31 December 2005.
The projected unit method of valuation was used for both schemes and the financial assumptions, except where indicated to the contrary, used to calculate the schemes liabilities are as follows: 2005 2004 % % Discount rate 4.7 5.3 Inflation rate 2.9 2.9 Expected weighted return on schemes assets 6.3 6.5 Rate of increase to pensions in payment Pre April 2003 pensions Slough Bilton 4.1 2.8 4.2 2.7 April 2003 to October 2005 pensions 2.8 2.7 Post October 2005 pensions 2.1 Rate of increase in salaries 4.9 4.9 2005 2004 m m Analysis of the amount charged to operating profit Current service cost 3.0 3.2 Past service costs 0.7 2.3 3.2 Analysis of the amount credited charged to other finance income expense Interest on pension liabilities 5.8 5.3 Expected return on schemes assets 5.3 4.4 0.5 0.9 Total charged to income 2.8 4.1 Analysis of the amount recognised in the statement of recognised income and expenses 2005 2004 m m Actual return less expected return on assets 10.2 1.1 Experienced gains and losses on liabilities 13.9 6.2 Changes in financial assumptions underlying the present value of the schemes liabilities actuarial loss 17.5 3.7 10.2 Cumulative actuarial losses recognised in the SORIE amount to 14.6 million.
The actual return on the schemes assets was 15.5 million 2004: 5.4 million.
The analysis of the assets in the Slough and Bilton schemes and the expected rates of return at the balance sheet date were as follows: Expected rate Fair value of return of assets 2005 2004 2005 2004 % % m m Equities 7.50 7.55 63.2 44.4 Bonds 4.30 4.75 38.0 25.3 Other including property 5.56 6.06 2.4 1.5 Total market value of assets 6.28 6.52 103.6 71.2 104 Slough Estates plc Annual Report 2005 34.
Retirement benefit schemes continued The expected return on plan assets is a blended average of projected long-term returns for the various asset classes.
Asset class returns are based on a forward looking building block approach.
Equity returns are developed based on the selection of an equity risk premium above the risk free rate which is measured in accordance with the yields on government bonds.
Returns on property are assumed to be 1 per cent p. a. lower than those on equities.
Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the schemes holdings of these instruments.

Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of consolidation Prior to the introduction of IFRS, the Group had prepared its financial statements under UK accounting standards.
As a result of adopting IFRS it has been necessary to change many of the Groups accounting policies and these are shown below.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group include the financial statements of Slough Estates plc the Company and its subsidiaries collectively referred to as the Group and the Groups share of profits and losses and net assets of joint ventures and associate made up to 31 December 2005.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the Group has control and fide-recognises subsidiaries on the date the control no longer exists.
Slough Estates plc Annual Report 2005 123 Notes to the financial statements continued 53.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by other members of the Group.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint venture concerned.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
The companys investments in subsidiaries, associate and joint ventures are held at cost.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost, adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associates, less any impairment in the value of individual investments of the associates.
Where a Group entity transacts with an associate of the Group, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate, except to the extent that unrealised losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Interests in joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
Where a Group company undertakes its activities under joint venture arrangements directly, the Groups share of jointly controlled assets and any liabilities incurred jointly with other venturers are recognised in the financial statements of the Group and classified according to their nature.
Liabilities and expenses incurred directly in respect of interests in jointly controlled assets are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Joint venture arrangements which involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest are referred to as jointly controlled entities.
The Group reports its interests in jointly controlled entities using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in joint ventures are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the joint ventures, less any impairment in the value of individual investments of the joint ventures.
Where the Group transacts with its jointly controlled entities, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant joint venture, except to the extent that unrealised losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate that are accounted for as business combinations are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess deficiency of the joint ventures or associates cost of acquisition over below the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill negative goodwill.
Goodwill is carried in the balance sheet at cost less any accumulated impairment.
Negative goodwill is immediately recognised in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments derivatives The Group uses derivatives, particularly interest rate swaps, to help manage its interest rate risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
Derivatives are recognised initially at cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are stated at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, in which case recognition depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
Currently none of the Groups derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than sterling are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in such currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Profits and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement, except where foreign currency denominated loans are designated as a hedge of the Groups investment in its overseas subsidiaries.
In this case the exchange difference is taken to equity until the realisation of the overseas investment and then it is transferred to the income statement as part of the profit or loss on realisation.
124 Slough Estates plc Annual Report 2005 53.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Investment property Investment properties are those properties that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both.
Investment properties may be freehold properties or leasehold properties.
For leasehold properties that are classified as investment properties, the associated leasehold obligations are accounted for as finance lease obligations.
Valuation surpluses and deficits arising in the period are included in the income statement.
Existing investment properties undergoing redevelopment, for the purpose of earning future rental income, continue to be accounted for as investment properties.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including related transaction costs.
After initial recognition at cost, investment properties are carried at their fair values based on a professional valuation made as of each reporting date.
Properties are treated as acquired at the point when the Group assumes the significant risks and returns of ownership and as disposed when these are transferred to the buyer.
Additions to investment properties consist of costs of a capital nature and, in the case of investment properties under development, capitalised interest.
Certain internal staff and associated costs directly attributable to the management of developments under construction are also capitalised.
When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property with a view to sale, the property is transferred to trading properties and held as a current asset.
The property is re-stated to fair value as at the date of the transfer, with any gain or loss being taken to the Group income statement.
The re-stated amount becomes the deemed cost at which the property is then carried in trading properties.
Property that is being constructed or developed for future use as an investment property, but which has not previously been classified as such, is classified as investment property under development within development property.
This is recognised initially at cost but is subsequently re-stated to fair value at each reporting date.
Any gain or loss on re-statement is taken direct to equity unless a loss in the period exceeds the net cumulative gain previously recognised in equity.
In the latter case, the amount by which the loss in the period exceeds the net cumulative gain previously recognised is taken to the income statement.
On completion, the property is transferred to investment property with any final difference on re-measurement accounted for in accordance with the foregoing policy.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of a property is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the beginning of the period and is recognised in the Group income statement.
An investment property is regarded as sold when the significant risks and returns have been transferred to the purchaser.
For conditional exchanges, sales are recognised once all of the conditions are satisfied.
Development properties Properties under this heading comprise those properties acquired for development and completed properties occupied by Group companies.
They are fair valued on the same basis as investment properties.
Surpluses and deficits arising on the revaluation of such land and buildings are credited to the revaluation reserve, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation deficit for the same asset previously recognised in income, in which case the increase is credited to the income statement to the extent of the deficit previously charged.
A decrease in carrying amount arising on the revaluation of such land and buildings is charged as an expense to the extent that it exceeds the balance, if any, held in the revaluation reserve relating to a previous revaluation of that asset.
On the subsequent sale or retirement of a revalued property, the attributable revaluation surplus remaining in the revaluation reserve is transferred directly to accumulated profits.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the beginning of the period and is recognised in the income statement.
Owner-occupied properties are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, normally 30 years.
Plant and equipment comprise the power station assets, oil and gas plant and equipment of Tipperary Corporation, computers, motor vehicles, furniture, fixtures and fittings, and improvements to group offices.
These assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Slough Estates plc Annual Report 2005 125 Notes to the financial statements continued 53.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Group company as lessee a Operating leases leases in which the Group does not have substantially all risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Payments, including prepayments, made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
b Finance leases leases of assets where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the lease commencement at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding.
The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in current and non-current borrowings.
The finance charges are charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
Investment properties acquired under finance leases are carried at their fair value.
Group company as lessor a Operating leases properties leased out to tenants under operating leases are included in investment properties in the balance sheet.
b Finance leases when assets are leased out under a finance lease, the present value of the minimum lease payments is recognised as a receivable.
The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance income.
Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method before tax, which reflects a constant periodic rate of return.
Where only the buildings element of a property lease is classified as a finance lease, the land element is shown within investment properties.
Trading properties Properties developed and held for sale are classified as trading properties and are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct expenditure and interest capitalised during the development period.
The development period ends on practical completion.
Profit from pre-sold trading developments is recognised according to the stage reached in the contract by reference to the value of work completed using the percentage of completion method.
An appropriate estimate of the profit attributable to work completed is recognised once the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably.
The amount due from customers for contract work is shown as a receivable.
The amount due comprises costs incurred plus recognised profits, less the sum of recognised losses and progress billings.
Where the sum of recognised losses and progress billings exceeds costs incurred plus recognised profits, the amount is shown as a liability.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale investments are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale.
These represent mainly the investments in Charterhouse USA, Candover and certain warrants in US companies who are tenants of the Group.
The investments are held at fair value with gains and losses taken to equity.
The gains and losses taken to equity are recycled through the income statement on realisation.
If there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
The amount removed from equity and recognised in the income statement, is the difference between the acquisition cost net of any principal repayment and amortisation and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in income.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement are not reversed through income.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and which form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Impairment The Groups assets are, other than investment properties, reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated see below.
An impairment loss is recognised in income whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped together at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
126 Slough Estates plc Annual Report 2005 53.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its net selling price and its value-in-use.
The value-in-use is determined as the net present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Any impairment of financial assets is based on the original effective interest rate attributable to the financial asset on acquisition.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount after the reversal does not exceed the amount that would have been determined, net of applicable depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classed as equity.
External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to the companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects is included in equity attributable to the companys equity holders.
Borrowings Borrowings other than bank overdrafts are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest method.
Convertible redeemable preference shares The convertible redeemable preference shares are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate at the time of issue for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the net proceeds of issue of the convertible redeemable preference shares and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity capital reserves.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible redeemable preference shares based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate at the time of issue for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument.
The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible loan note.
Pensions The obligations of defined benefit pension schemes are measured at discounted present value while scheme assets are measured at their fair value.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are spread systematically over the working lives of the employees concerned and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from either experience differing from previous actuarial assumptions or changes to those assumptions are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are expensed as incurred.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a constructive or legal obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
Provision is made for dilapidations that will crystallise in the future where, on the basis of the present condition of the property, an obligation exists at the reporting date and can be reliably measured.
The estimate is revised over the remaining period of the lease to reflect changes in the condition of the building or other changes in circumstances.
The estimate of the obligation takes account of relevant external advice.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
Revenue Revenue comprises rental income, service charges and other recoveries from tenants of the Groups investment and trading properties and proceeds of sales of its trading properties, sales of electricity, water and steam to Utility customers and gas to Tipperary customers.
Rental income includes the net income from managed operations such as car parks, food courts and serviced offices.
Service charges and other recoveries include income in relation to service charges and directly recoverable expenditure together with any chargeable management fees.
Where revenue is obtained from the rendering of services, it is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the relevant transactions at the reporting date.
Slough Estates plc Annual Report 2005 127 Notes to the financial statements continued 53.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Rental income from investment property leased out under operating leases is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the net consideration for the use of the property and are therefore also recognised on the same, straight-line basis.
When property is let out under a finance lease, the Group recognises a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease at inception of the lease.
Rentals received are accounted for as repayments of principal and finance income as appropriate.
Minimum lease payments receivable on finance leases are apportioned between finance income and reduction of the outstanding receivable.
Finance income is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining net investment in the finance lease.
Contingent rents, being those lease payments that are not fixed at the inception of a lease, for example increases arising on rent reviews, are recorded as income in the periods in which they are earned.
Rent reviews are recognised as income when it is reasonable to assume that they will be received.
Rent reviews are recognised as income based on estimates to be received or amounts received.
Surrender premiums received in the period from tenants vacating the property before the end of the lease are included in rental income.
A trading property is regarded as sold when the significant risks and returns have been transferred to the purchaser.
Income from Utilities and gas sales is recognised on an accruals basis.
Share-based payments The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration to employees and directors is recognised through the income statement.
The Group has used the Black-Scholes option valuation model and the resulting value is amortised through the income statement over the vesting period of the options.
The charge is reversed if it appears likely that the performance criteria will not be met.
Own shares held in connection with employee share plans or other share based payment arrangements are treated as treasury shares and deducted from equity, and no profit or loss is recognised on their sale, issue or cancellation.
Borrowing costs Gross borrowing costs relating to direct expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised.
The interest capitalised is calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowing.
Interest is capitalised as from the commencement of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Group income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Income tax Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or negative goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
No provision is made for temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit.
Indexation relief on land is recognised as a reduction of the deferred tax liability but not on the buildings unless the properties are in the process of being sold.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group is entitled to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued Segment reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
The Groups primary reporting segments are geographical.
The secondary reporting segments are by business activity.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved.
Exceptional items These are significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
New standards IFRS 6 and 7 and IFRIC 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 have been issued but are not effective for the year ended 31 December 2005.
It is believed that they will not have a material impact on the financial statements on initial application.
Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards Significant differences between UK GAAP and IFRS as at 31 December 2004 are summarised as follows:- IAS 40 Investment property Under IAS 40, an investment property is recognised in the accounts at fair value, with revaluation gains being taken directly to the Group income statement rather than directly to the revaluation reserve as was previously required under UK GAAP.
Accumulated revaluation surpluses relating to investment properties as at the transition date have been reallocated to retained earnings.
This treatment does not, however, have any impact on the distributable profits.
As at 31 December 2004 valuation gains relating to development properties amounting to 36.3 million are held within revaluation reserves under IAS 16 until the developments are completed, at which point the surplus will be transferred to retained earnings.
IAS 12 Income taxes Under IAS 12, deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences rather than timing differences, which has been the basis in the UK under SSAP 15.
Timing differences, which focus on profit and loss movements, are the difference between the taxable amount and the pre-tax accounting profit that originate in one reporting period and reverse in one or more subsequent periods.
Temporary differences, which focus on balance sheet movements, are the differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base.
In many cases, the deferred tax provision is the same under IAS 12 as under FRS 19.
However, under FRS 19, deferred tax is not provided on the revaluation surplus when a fixed asset is revalued without there being any commitment or intention to sell the asset.
IAS 12 requires deferred tax to be provided in these circumstances.
Where the revaluation has been reflected directly in reserves, the deferred tax is also charged directly to reserves, with no impact on earnings.
The tax provision has been mitigated by recognising indexation allowances on the land element of the investment properties.
As the Group has no intention to sell its investment properties, it cannot recognise the indexation relating to the building element.
The amount remains as a contingent asset and is disclosed in note 32 of these financial statements.
IAS 19 Employee benefits This standard continues the measurement requirements of FRS 17 for defined benefit pension schemes.
In the Groups 2004 financial statements these measurement bases were disclosures whilst the accounts were drawn up under SSAP 24.
The net effect for the year ended 31 December 2004 is to reduce profit before tax by 0.7 million.
In addition, the prepayment recognised under UK GAAP in respect of additional contributions 0.5 million at 31 December 2004 is not recognised under IAS 19, while the net actuarial deficit of 41.5 million is recognised in full.
Service costs, the expected return on pension scheme assets and interest on pension scheme liabilities are charged in arriving at profit before tax, while experience gains and losses flow through the Statement of recognised income and expense, broadly equivalent to UK GAAPs Statement of Recognised Gains and Losses.
The Group has decided to take advantage of the exemption in IAS 19 in relation to defined benefit schemes not to adopt the corridor approach and has recognised in full the pension scheme deficit on the balance sheet.
IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures and associate Under UK GAAP, the Group was required to recognise its share of the joint ventures and associates profit before interest and its share of interest and tax with the Group figures on the face of the profit and loss account.
The Groups aggregate share of the gross assets and gross liabilities of the joint ventures and associate were shown separately on the balance sheet.
Slough Estates plc Annual Report 2005 129 Notes to the financial statements continued 54.
Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards continued IAS 31 allows companies to make a one-time choice as to whether joint ventures will be accounted under the equity method or proportionally consolidated.
The Group has opted to use the equity method and report its joint ventures and associates profit after tax as a single line in the income statement and its share of the net assets as a single line in the balance sheet.
Additional disclosures will be made of the underlying income, expenditure, assets and liabilities for the joint ventures, together with supplemental notes.
IAS 17 Leases IAS 17 requires a lease to be classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease.
A finance lease exists if substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred to the tenant.
The classification test is done separately for the land and buildings elements of a lease whereas under UK GAAP the test is done on the lease itself.
The Group has tested all of its leases and has established that the majority are operating leases.
Some twelve finance leases have been identified and these are accounted for as such.
The accounting treatment of a finance lease under IFRS is to assume that the building has been effectively sold to the tenant.
A receivable is recognised in the balance sheet at the inception of the lease at an amount equal to the net present value of the minimum lease payments.
The impact on the balance sheet at 31 December 2004 is to reduce investment properties by 21.7 million, increase receivables by 11.0 million and reduce retained earnings by 10.7 million.
Under IFRS the rental income for the whole property is split into three elements: Rental income on the land: Interest income on the debtor balance due from the tenant: and Repayment of the debtor.
The impact on the previously reported 2004 UK GAAP net rental income is minimal.
Since the carrying value of the finance lease is not reassessed at each reporting date, the open market value of the building may differ significantly from the value of the finance lease receivable at that date.
Where an investment property is itself subject to a head or groundlease, that headlease is treated as if it were a finance lease.
In total four properties are affected, leading to the recognition of a finance lease liability of 0.5 million at 31 December 2004 and an increase in the carrying value of the Groups properties by 0.5 million.
IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date IAS 10 requires that a liability should not be recognised in respect of a dividend until the paying company has an obligation to make the payment.
This would normally be when it was declared or approved at the annual general meeting in the case of the final dividend for the year.
As a result the 2004 proposed final dividend of 41.3 million is excluded from the IFRS balance sheet and written back to retained earnings.
IFRS also requires that dividends and distributions are presented in a different way to current UK GAAP.
Under IFRS, dividends are not considered to be an expense of the paying company so they are not included in the income statement.
Instead, dividends are treated as a reserve item and are, therefore, presented in the statement of changes in equity alongside other transactions with shareholders.
IAS 32 and 39 Financial instruments The Group has chosen to take the exemption permitted under IFRS from applying IAS 32 and 39 in the year ended 31 December 2004.
However, there are a number of effects on the Groups financial statements which apply from 1 January 2005. a Preference shares Under UK GAAP the Groups cumulative redeemable convertible preference shares were shown within share capital on the Groups balance sheet.
Under IFRS the shares are considered to be a form of debt with an embedded derivative known as an equity instrument in respect of the option for shareholders to convert.
The Group has therefore split the value of the shares between a financial liability which is shown within liabilities and an equity instrument which is shown within equity.
Interest costs increase as a charge will arise in relation to the financial liability shown within liabilities.
The effect of this accounting is to reduce the Groups net assets, reduce profits and increase liabilities.
There is no effect on the 2004 amounts as the Group has decided to apply IAS 32 and 39 with effect from 1 January 2005 as allowed by the standards.
However, finance charges increase by 13.2 million in 2005, as a result of this change in accounting policy.
b Interest rate hedges and other derivatives Under IFRS and as from 1 January 2005 the Group is required to recognise the fair value of its derivatives including interest rate hedges and currency swaps on the balance sheet and movements in those values within the income statement.
Previously these were disclosed but not recognised in the Groups accounts.
The Groups interest rate hedges and currency swaps do not meet the strict criteria set out in the standard for hedge accounting.
Although the Group is satisfied that, economically, all of its interest rate hedges do indeed offset interest rate exposures, the practical difficulty in forecasting accurately the amount and timing of cash receipts and payments associated with investment portfolio transactions means that the IAS 39 tests on hedge effectiveness may not be met.
In addition, in many cases, the length of the hedge could exceed the remaining term of the Groups committed bank facilities.
As a result shareholders funds have been reduced by 2.9 million at 1 January 2005.

Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards continued c Available-for-sale investments Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for its available-for-sale investments at the lower of cost and market value and these were shown in current assets on the balance sheet.
Profits and losses arising from their disposal were taken to income.
Under IAS 39, these investments are carried at fair value and classified in the balance sheet as available-for-sale investments under non-current assets.
Movements in fair value are taken directly to equity and recycled through the income statement when the investments are realised.
SIC-15 Operating leases incentives The cost of rent free periods and other incentives given to tenants under operating leases are spread over the term of the lease rather than, as under UK GAAP, to the first review to market rents.
Further, there are no transitional provisions so that incentives granted before IFRS came into effect have now been brought back into account.
This will change the timing but not the aggregate amount recognised in relation to lease incentives.
IFRS 3 Business combinations Goodwill arising on acquisitions is not amortised under IFRS, but is subject to impairment review at each reporting date.
The Groups property acquisition arising from the exchange of properties with Land Securities Group plc has been treated as an acquisition of assets rather than a business combination.
Adjustments have therefore been made in 2004 to remove the negative goodwill of 4.7 million and deferred tax of 4.1 million created under UK GAAP.
IFRS 2 Share-based payment IFRS 2 requires the cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration to employees and directors to be recognised through the income statement.
The Group has used the Black-Scholes option valuation model and the resulting fair value is being charged through the income statement over the vesting period of the options.
Fair value takes account of the likelihood of the options becoming in the money in the future.
This results in a credit to the income statement in the year of 0.4 million, which is net of provisions previously made by the Group in respect of the cost of certain of the share-based compensation arrangements.
Only share based transactions after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005 have been restated, as permitted by the Standard.
