The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, are set out below.
Change in accounting policies The company has adopted FRS 17 Retirement benets which, in general, requires the company to recognise its share of the actuarial valuation for the dened benefit scheme operated by The Davis Service Group Plc.
This is a change from the previous approach permitted by SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs applied by the company in previous years.
The cumulative effect of this change in accounting policy relating to previous years has been recognised in the financial statements as a prior year adjustment.
The effect has been to reduce distributable reserves by 29.6 million in 2004 and 9.7 million in 2005.
Details of the deferred tax effect of adopting FRS 17, including the impact on the comparative gures, are given in note 37c.
The company has adopted FRS 20 Accounting for share based payments which requires the company to recognise an expense in relation to awarded share options to employees.
The cumulative effect of this change in accounting policy relating to previous years has been recognised in the financial statements as a prior year adjustment, the effect of which is minimal to these financial statements.
Fixed assets Land and buildings are shown at original historical cost or subsequent valuation.
Other xed assets are shown at cost.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life, as follows: Straight line % Plant and machinery 10 50 Motor vehicles 25 Investments Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided on a full provision basis, without discounting, on all timing differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Except where otherwise required by Accounting Standards, no timing differences are recognised in respect of: a Property revaluation surpluses where there is no commitment to sell the asset: b Gains on sale of assets where those gains have been rolled over into replacement assets: c Additional tax which would arise if profits of overseas subsidiaries were distributed, and d Deferred tax assets except to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Pension costs It is the policy of the company to fund dened pension liabilities, on the advice of external actuaries, by payments to schemes controlled by independent trustees.
Pension costs are charged against profits on a systematic basis over the service lives of the eligible employees, based on payroll, actuarial methods and assumptions, in accordance with the actuaries advice.
The costs of dened contribution schemes or pension arrangements of a similar nature are charged against income as contributions become payable to the relevant scheme or arrangement.
The companys pension cost charged to the profit and loss account is in accordance with FRS17 Retirement Benets.
The FRS 17 valuation has been carried out at mid-market price.
Derivatives and other financial instruments Interest expense reects the underlying cost of borrowing arising from interest rate swaps.
Net payments and receipts under interest rate swap contracts are accrued over the period to which they relate and added to or credited against interest expense.
No accounting entries are required for the principal amount of interest rate swaps as it is purely a notional gure and does not represent an asset, a liability or a contingency.
Employee share schemes In accordance with the FRS 20 Accounting for share based payments, an expense is recognised in the profit and loss account for the award to employees of shares in the companys UK Inland Revenue approved Sharesave Scheme.
Cash ow statement and related party disclosures The parent company is included in the consolidated financial statements, which are publicly available see note 17.
Consequently, the company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash ow statement under the terms of the FRS 1 revised 1996.
The company is also exempt under the terms of the FRS 8 from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of The Davis Service Group Plc or investees of The Davis Service Group Plc.
