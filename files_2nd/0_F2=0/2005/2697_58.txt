Changes and Proposed Changes to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles In November 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No.
151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No.
SFAS 151 requires idle facility expenses, freight, handling costs and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognised as current period charges.
It also requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities.
SFAS 151 will be effective for such costs incurred during the fiscal years beginning after 15 June 2005.
The Group is in the process of evaluating the impact of this standard on its financial statements.
In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No.
153 SFAS 153, Exchanges of Non-Monetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion No.
29, Accounting for Non-monetary Transactions, APB 29 by eliminating the exception to the fair value principle for exchanges of similar productive assets.
SFAS 153 also eliminates the APB 29 concept of culmination of an earnings process.
The amendment requires that an exchange on non-monetary assets be accounted for at fair value if the exchange has commercial substance and fair value is determinable within reasonable limits.
SFAS 153 is effective for non-monetary transactions occurring in fiscal periods beginning after 15 June 2005.
The impact of SFAS 153 will depend on the nature and extent of any exchanges of non-monetary transactions after the effective date, but the Group does not currently expect SFAS 153 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In February 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No.
155 SFAS 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No.
SFAS 155 nullifies the guidance from the FASBs Derivatives Implementation Group DIG in Issue D1, Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets, which deferred the application of the bifurcation requirements of SFAS 133 for certain beneficial interests.
SFAS 155 provides a fair value measurement option for certain hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation and requires that beneficial interests in securitised financial assets be analysed to determine whether they are freestanding derivatives or whether they are hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation.
SFAS 155 also provides clarification on specific points related to derivative accounting.
SFAS 155 is effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 September 2006.
The Group does not currently expect SFAS 155 to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In June 2005 EITF 05-05 Accounting for Early Retirement or Post-employment Programs with Specific Features Such As Terms Specified in Altersteilzeit Early Retirement Arrangements EITF 05-05 was issued.
EITF 05-05 provides specific guidance on how to account for such features and is effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2005.
The Group does not currently expect EITF 05-05 to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, introduces new disclosures to improve the information about financial instruments.
It requires the disclosures of qualitative and quantitative information about exposure to risks arising from financial instruments, including specified minimum disclosures about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, including sensitivity analysis to market risk.
It replaces disclosure requirements in IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation.
IFRS 7 is effective for fiscal years beginning 1 January 2007.
The Group will apply IFRS 7 and the amendment to IAS 1 from annual periods beginning 1 January 2007, and it is not expected to have a material effect on its disclosures.
IFRIC 4, Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, requires the determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease to be based on the substance of the arrangement.
IFRIC 4 is effective for fiscal years beginning 1 January 2006.
The Group does not currently expect IFRIC 4 to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
