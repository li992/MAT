Annual report 2005 Notes 2 Segmental analysis continued As a result of the refinancing during the year, the Directors have reconsidered the inter-divisional transfer terms, to ensure that products are supplied by WDB Brands to other divisions on an arms length market basis.
The allocation of central overheads was also considered and revised.
Following this review, the operating profit comparatives for each division have been restated.
This has reduced the profit in Pathfinder Pubs by 3.8m, The Union Pub Company by 1.1m, WDB Brands by 3.6m and increased profits in Central by 8.5m.
Turnover originates from operations in the UK and is not materially different from turnover by destination.
Acquisition details are included in notes 27 to 29.
