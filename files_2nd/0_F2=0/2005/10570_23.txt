78 Notes to the Company financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 7 Financial instruments The financial instruments, excluding short-term debtors and creditors are comprised of cash and loan notes.
The directors consider the fair value not to be materially different to the carrying value for financial instruments.
The Company holds part of its cash as sterling deposits with counterparties, which are at a fixed rate based on LIBOR and for periods not exceeding three months.
The objective of placing these deposits with financial institutions approved by the Board is to maximise interest received.
By placing surplus funds with approved counterparties the Companys risk profile is not significantly changed from maintaining funds with the Companys clearing bank.
There are no amounts included within cash at bank and in hand 2004: 8,365,000 which is not accessible within 24 hours without penalty.
During the year under review the Company did not enter into derivative transactions and has not undertaken trading in any financial instruments.
Loan notes Loan notes were issued in 2002 as part of the consideration for the acquisition of Pipeline Constructors Group plc.
Their interest rate is determined by reference to a six month sterling money market deposit and as such varies every six months.
They are redeemable by the loan note holders at six monthly intervals which commenced on 2 January 2003.
Of these, 240,000 were redeemed by loan note holders in 2005 and the remaining 120,000 were redeemed on 2 January 2006.
8 Retirement benefit schemes The Morgan Sindall Retirement Benefits Plan MSRBP was established on 31 May 1995 and operates on defined contribution principles where contributions are invested to accumulate capital sums to provide members with retirement and death benefits.
MSRBP includes some defined benefit liabilities and transfers of funds representing the accrued benefit right of former active and deferred members of pension plans of companies which are part of the Group as it now stands.
These include final salary related benefits for the members of the former Sindall Group Pension Fund in respect of benefits accrued before 31 May 1995.
No further defined benefit membership rights can accrue after that date and consequently there is no service cost for such benefits in the year.
The last triennial valuation of the MSRBP was undertaken on 5 April 2004 and was prepared using the assumptions of the rate of investment return of 6.0% per annum, rate of earnings escalation of 4.0% per annum and rate of inflation of 2.5% per annum.
The ongoing liabilities of the MSRBP were assessed using the projected unit method whereas the assets were taken at realisable market value.
The actuarial valuation referred to showed that the defined benefit liabilities were partly funded and on an ongoing basis, the value of the assets of 3.9m represented 64% of the value of these liabilities.
The actuarial valuation also showed that the realisable market value of the MSRBPs assets was 81% of its minimum liabilities when assessed on the Minimum Funding Requirement basis as defined in the Pensions Act 1995.
The next triennial valuation will be carried out at 5 April 2007 when the funding position will be reappraised.
