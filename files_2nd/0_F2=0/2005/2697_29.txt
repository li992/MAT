The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next four years and extrapolates cash flows for no more than five years, using a steady growth rate applicable to the relevant market.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The carrying amounts of significant goodwill by cash generating unit are as follows: 2005 2004 m m North America Beverages 525 470 USA and Canadian Confectionery 878 784 MECCA Confectionery 287 244 Western Europe Confectionery 227 255 The North America Beverages goodwill arose principally on the acquisition of DPSU, Snapple and Motts.
