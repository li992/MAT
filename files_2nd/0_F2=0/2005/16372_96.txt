On 15 February 2005, after close of trading, NV converted part of the notional value of the 0.05 cumulative preference shares into NV ordinary shares.
Upon conversion, the holders of the preference shares received one NV ordinary share for every 11.2 preference shares held.
This resulted in a total of 18 881 587 NV ordinary shares being transferred to the preference shareholders.
These NV ordinary shares had previously been held as treasury shares by NV.
As a consequence of the conversion, the notional value of the preference shares was reduced to 0.05.

The preference shares were cancelled at midnight on 13 July 2005 and were delisted by Euronext Amsterdam with effect from 14 July 2005.
