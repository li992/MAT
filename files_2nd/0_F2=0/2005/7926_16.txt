DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Executive Directors conditional share awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan continued In respect of the November 2002 November 2005 award, based on EPS to the end of the financial year, 100 per cent of the award will vest on 25 November 2005.
For illustrative purposes only, the share price on 28 October 2005, being the latest practicable date prior to publication, was 15.91 valuing the awards as follows: Award vesting Award vesting Award lapsing no.

The Remuneration Committee regards the November 2003 November 2006 and the November 2004 November 2007 awards to be too distant from maturity to be included in the value projected above.
However, in respect of these awards, the adjusted average EPS has grown by more than 10 per cent per annum in real terms in the performance period to the end of September 2005 and, therefore, if this performance were maintained over the relevant performance periods both awards would vest in full, their illustrative values based on the above share price are as follows.

Share Matching Scheme SMS Annual Scheme Under the SMS, the Remuneration Committee, at its absolute discretion, invites Executive Directors and most of the Groups management to invest any proportion, up to a maximum of 100 per cent, of their gross bonus in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Ordinary Shares to be held by a nominee controlled by the Employee Benefit Trust.
Provided that the shares lodged are left with the nominee for three years, they will be matched on a one for one basis.
However, in respect of investments made by Executive Directors under the SMS from their bonus paid in December 2003, and for future years, a performance criterion will be applied to the matched shares such that matching will only occur if the Group has achieved in excess of an average three per cent real increase in EPS per annum over the three year retention period, being an indicator of sustained ongoing profit delivery.
Achievement measurement is based on the same protocol as that applying to the LTIP.
There is no opportunity to re-test if this performance criterion is not met.
In setting the performance criterion for SMS awards, the Remuneration Committee decided that EPS reflects a key part of the Groups strategy to create sustainable shareholder value.
Under the scheme rules, should Imperial Tobacco be acquired, the performance period would come to an end on the date of acquisition.
Any outstanding awards would vest on a time pro-rata basis, subject to the achievement of any applicable performance criterion.
The performance criterion will be adjusted to ensure consistent measurement during the transition to IFRS.
