The table below presents the changes in fair value of the Group's financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market rates.
The analysis below shows forward-looking projections of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
The sensitivity figures are calculated based on an upward parallel shift of 1% in yield curves and 10% weakening of Sterling against other exchange rates.
This is a method of analysis used to assess and mitigate risk and should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
Actual results and market conditions in the future may be materially different from those projected and changes in the instruments held and in the financial markets in which the Group operates could cause losses to exceed the amounts projected.
