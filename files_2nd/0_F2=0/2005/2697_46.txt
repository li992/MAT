Acquisitions 2005 Acquisitions During the year, the Group purchased Green & Blacks, achieved final settlement on the acquisition of the Adams business in China and completed a number of small acquisitions for a total cash consideration of 38 million.
The acquisition of Green & Blacks, the premium organic chocolate business, occurred on 12 May 2005.
The Group purchased a 5 per cent stake in the company in 2002 and acquired the remaining shares in 2005.
The acquisition of the business adds the UKs fastest growing confectionery brand to the Groups portfolio.
This will enable the Group to benefit from the continued growth of the luxury organic chocolate brand and enhance the international expansion of Green & Blacks.
A brand intangible of 25 million and goodwill of 7 million have been recognised in the financial statements.
The net assets of the companies acquired during the year are not significant in comparison to the Group and there were no other significant provisional fair value adjustments.
The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are provisional due to the timing of the transactions.
Fair value adjustments will be finalised in the 2006 accounts.

This followed the 2003 acquisition of the Adams Confectionery business from Pfizer Inc in all jurisdictions except China.
On 31 October 2004, the Company acquired the rights to produce and distribute Orangina for a number of additional countries, the most significant of which were the UK, Algeria and Croatia.
The total cash paid including acquisition costs amounted to 59 million, on which goodwill of 57 million arose.
