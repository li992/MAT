In June 2005, the Company issued 600m of 4% dated subordinated notes.
The proceeds were swapped into sterling and will be used to repay part of the convertible bond which matures in 2006.
The notes are callable on 8 June 2015 and each year thereafter.

In March 2004, the Company issued 400m of 5.875% undated subordinated notes.
These notes are callable on 1 April 2019 and every five years thereafter.
If not called, the coupon from 1 April 2019 will be reset to the prevailing five year benchmark gilt yield plus 2.33% pa.
Coupon payments on both subordinated issues may be deferred if no dividend is paid on the Groups ordinary shares.
The undated subordinated notes have been classied as equity because their perpetual nature means that in certain circumstances, interest can be deferred indefinitely.

The facility also has two one year extension options at the end of the first two years.
The maturity prole above is calculated on the basis that a facility to renance a maturing loan is not recognised unless the facility and loan are related.
If renancing under the Companys syndicated facility was recognised, then all amounts shown as repayable within one year would be reclassied as repayable between one and five years.
The effective interest rate is the rate which exactly discounts future cash payments over the life of the borrowing and will include all transaction costs and premium or discount on issue.
iii Convertible bonds In December 2001, the Company issued 525m of convertible bonds due in 2006 which generated net proceeds after expenses of 515m.
A coupon of 2.75% per annum is paid semi-annually and the bonds convert into ordinary shares of the Company at a conversion price of 184p per share.
The convertible bonds could have been redeemed in 2005, and thereafter at the option of the Company, at par, provided the price of the ordinary shares of the Company exceed 120% of the conversion price.
The bonds would, if converted, give rise to the issue of 285,326,086 new ordinary shares representing approximately 4.4% of the current issued ordinary share capital.
On conversion, the bonds may be settled in shares or in cash at the option of the Company.
The debt component, net of expenses, of the convertible bond recognised in the balance sheet is calculated as follows: 2005 2004 m m Debt component at 1 January 493 478 Interest expense 30 29 Coupons paid 14 14 Debt component at 31 December 509 493 The fair value of the debt component of the convertible bond at 31 December 2005 amounted to 517m 2004: 505m.
Interest expense on the bond is calculated using the effective interest rate of 5.7% pa on the debt component.

PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENT AND IMPACT OF NEW STANDARDS The prior year adjustment relates to the implementation of FRS 20, FRS 21, FRS 23, FRS 25 and FRS 26.
The adoption of FRS 20 has resulted in an increase in total equity of 8m at 1 January 2005 2004: 3m due to the recognition of the cost of share awards in equity.
The adoption of FRS 21, and the change in the requirements of company law relating to presentation and disclosure of proposed final dividends has resulted in a change to previous practice, under which dividends were accrued in the period to which they related irrespective of when they were declared or approved.
Under the new requirements, final dividends are only accrued when approved by the Companys shareholders at the general meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
This has resulted in an increase in total equity of 224m at 1 January 2005 2004: 216m.
The adoption of FRS 23 has not had an impact on the closing position of 2004. www.
qxd 31 3 06 2:24 am Page 142 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 14.
PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENT AND IMPACT OF NEW STANDARDS continued The adoption of FRS 25 has resulted in the bifurcation of the convertible debt issued by the Company into a debt component and a derivative component.
This has resulted in an increase in total equity of 15m at 1 January 2005 2004: 22m.
In accordance with FRS 26, the derivative is recognised at fair value with movements included within the profit and loss account for the year.
FRS 25 has also required the 400m 5.875% undated subordinated notes to be presented as equity, rather than as a liability.
The change in classication has resulted in an increase in total equity of 394m at 1 January 2005 2004: nil.
Under FRS 25 and FRS 26, the implementation of hedge accounting has resulted in an increase in total equity of 2m at 1 January 2005 2004: 2m.

SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS Full disclosure of the Companys investments in subsidiary undertakings is contained within Note 49 in the consolidated IFRS financial statements of the Group.
EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE On 13 March 2006, the Company entered into a supplementary trust deed in respect of the 400m undated subordinated notes issued in March 2004.
Under the terms of this deed, if regulations change so that the notes no longer qualify to be included in the Groups regulatory capital, the Group cannot exercise its discretion to defer interest.
This has had the effect of changing the classication of the notes from equity to liability and coupon payments on the notes from distributions to interest in 2006.
