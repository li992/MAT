NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 29 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP continued iii Deferred taxation Under UK GAAP, deferred taxation is provided in full on all material timing differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more likely than not.
US GAAP requires deferred taxation to be provided in full, using the liability method.
In addition, US GAAP requires the recognition of the deferred tax consequences of differences between the assigned values and the tax bases of the identifiable intangible assets, with the exception of non tax-deductible goodwill, in a purchase business combination.
Consequently, the deferred tax liability attributable to identifiable intangible assets has been recognised and is being amortised over the useful economic lives of the underlying intangible assets.
iv Derivative financial instruments The Group has entered into certain swap transactions with contractual maturities exceeding those of the underlying debt being hedged, in anticipation of there being additional floating rate debt when the existing debt matures.
Under UK GAAP, derivative financial instruments that reduce exposures on anticipated future transactions may be accounted for using hedge accounting.
US GAAP requires the Group to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
The Group has decided not to satisfy the SFAS No.
133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133 requirements to achieve hedge accounting for its derivatives, where permitted, and accordingly movements in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the profit and loss account.
v Proposed dividends Under UK GAAP, dividends paid and proposed are shown on the face of the profit and loss account as an appropriation of the current years earnings.
Proposed dividends are provided on the basis of recommendation by the Directors and are subject to subsequent approval by shareholders.
Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders.
vi Employee share schemes Under UK GAAP, the cost of employee share schemes is charged to the profit and loss account using the quoted market price of shares at the date of grant less the exercise price of the share options granted.
The charge is accrued over the vesting period of the shares.
SAYE type schemes are exempt from the requirement to recognise a charge to the profit and loss account.
Under US GAAP, the compensation cost is recognised for the difference between the exercise price of the share options granted and the quoted market price of the shares at the date of grant or measurement date and accrued over the vesting period of the options.
For option plans which contain performance criteria, compensation cost is remeasured at each period end until all performance criteria have been met.
The SAYE Scheme is regarded as compensatory and the discount is accrued over the vesting period of the grant.
vii Net income per share The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per ordinary share in accordance with SFAS 128.

IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 102 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 29 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP continued viii US GAAP equity roll forward Shareholders equity roll forward prepared in accordance with US GAAP is as follows: In s million 2005 2004 Balance at beginning of year 1,659 1,467 Net income 680 543 Dividends 373 326 ESOT shares 22 9 Purchase of Treasury Stock 201 Net exchange movements 20 34 Balance at end of year 1,807 1,659 ix Cash flow statements The consolidated cash flow statements have been prepared under UK GAAP in accordance with FRS 1 revised and present substantially the same information as required under SFAS 95.
There are certain differences between FRS 1 revised and SFAS 95 with regard to classification of items within the cash flow statement.
In accordance with FRS 1 revised, cash flows are prepared separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investment, acquisitions and disposals, equity dividends paid, management of liquid resources and financing.
Under SFAS 95, cash flows are classified under operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
Under FRS 1 revised, cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts repayable on demand.
Under SFAS 95, cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less.
A summary of the Groups cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities classified in accordance with SFAS 95 is presented below.
For the purposes of this summary, the Group considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
In s million 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities 931 793 411 Net cash used in investing activities 69 495 108 Net cash used in financing activities 953 345 380 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents 91 47 77 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 8 3 42 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 339 389 424 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year 256 339 389 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year are: Cash at bank and in hand 231 262 321 Current asset investments 25 77 68 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 103 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 29 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP continued x Impact of new accounting standards In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
151, Inventory Costs to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognised as current period charges.
In addition, SFAS 151 requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory values be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.
SFAS 151 is effective for costs incurred in respect of inventories for reporting periods beginning after 15 June 2005.
The adoption of SFAS 151 is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the Group.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.
123 R, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123 R, which is a revision of SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Generally the valuation methods contained in SFAS 123 R are similar to those in SFAS 123, but SFAS 123 R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee share options, to be charged to the statement of income.
Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.
With limited exceptions, the amount charged to the statement of income for share options will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the option amortised over the period to the date of vesting of the award.
SFAS 123 R is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after 15 June 2005.
In March 2005, the SEC issued SAB 107, which offers guidance on SFAS 123 R. SAB 107 was issued to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of SFAS 123 R while enhancing the information that investors receive.
SAB 107 creates a framework that is premised on two overarching themes: a considerable judgement will be required by preparers to successfully implement SFAS 123 R, specifically when valuing employee stock options: and b reasonable individuals, acting in good faith, may conclude differently on the fair value of employee stock options.
Key topics covered by SAB 107 include valuation models, expected volatility and expected term.
The Company will apply the principles of SAB 107 in conjunction with its adoption of SFAS 123 R. The adoption of SFAS 123 R is likely to reduce the annual US GAAP charge to income before taxation by approximately 5m, based on the current structure of the awards.
In May 2005, the FSAB issued SFAS No.
154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which is effective for periods beginning after 15 December 2005.
This statement replaces APB Opinion No.
20, Accounting Changes APB 20 and SFAS No.
3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.
APB 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognised by including, in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle.
SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change.
The adoption of SFAS 154 is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the Group.
xi Current asset classification As disclosed in note 13, 53m and 2m of debtors included within current assets in the UK GAAP balance sheet as at 30 September 2005 and 2004 respectively are due after more than 12 months and would be classified as long term assets in the US GAAP balance sheet.

The profit attributable to shareholders, dealt with in the accounts of the Company, is 299m 2004: 1,095m.
Own shares During the year the Company initiated a share buyback programme purchasing 13,515,000 ordinary shares of 10p each in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC for a cost of 201m including expenses.
The shares, representing 1.9% of issued share capital and having an aggregate nominal value of 1,351,500, have not been cancelled but are held in a treasury shares reserve within the profit and loss account reserve and represent a deduction from equity shareholders funds.
vi Contingent liabilities Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has guaranteed various borrowings and liabilities of certain UK and overseas subsidiary undertakings, including its Dutch and Irish subsidiaries.
At 30 September 2005, the contingent liability totalled 3,783m 2004: 4,053m.
The guarantees include the Dutch subsidiaries which, in accordance with Book 2, Article 403 of The Netherlands Civil Code, do not file separate accounts with the Chamber of Commerce.
Under the same article, Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has issued declarations to assume any and all liability for any and all debts of the Dutch subsidiaries.
The guarantees also cover the Irish subsidiaries, all of which are included in the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 September 2005.
The Irish companies, namely John Player & Sons Limited, John Player Distributors Limited and Imperial Tobacco Mullingar have therefore availed themselves of the exemption provided by section 17 of the Irish Companies Amendment Act 1986 in respect of documents required to be attached to the annual returns for such companies.

We support sensible and fair regulation that recognises we are a legitimate business, producing a legal product.
We continue our approach of constructive engagement with the authorities in the markets in which we operate.

We have never lost or settled any tobacco litigation and will continue to defend ourselves robustly against any further speculative claims.
Identifying and developing tomorrows leaders is a key activity for all businesses.
Several new initiatives were introduced in the year to develop our management team, with the aim of further improving performance and instilling the essence of what makes Imperial Tobacco successful.

IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 18 Effective Cash Management Our five year track record of cash conversion is strong with our operating cash flow after net capital expenditure averaging 92 per cent of adjusted operating profit.
Strong cash generation is a key hallmark of our business and the effective application of our cash is essential in continuing to deliver growth in shareholder value.
Our primary aim is to continue to develop the business through investment in organic growth and by pursuing value creating acquisitions.
In order to keep our balance sheet efficient while we are looking for value creating opportunities we commenced a share buyback programme in February.

The average share price paid was 1475 pence, excluding transaction costs.
Shares were purchased on market on the London Stock Exchange and are held as treasury shares on the balance sheet.
We have, and intend to renew at the 2006 AGM, shareholder approval to buy back up to 10 per cent of our issued share capital.
The Directors choose to exercise this power only when, in light of market conditions prevailing at the time, they believe that the effect of such purchases will be to increase earnings per share and is in the best interest of shareholders generally.
The share buyback programme is ongoing, and in the absence of value creating acquisitions, we intend to spend up to our annual free cash flow.
The impact of the share buyback programme for the financial year ended September 2005 was to increase adjusted earnings per share by 0.4 pence and basic earnings per share by 0.2 pence, after taking into account an increase in the net interest charge of 3 million and a decrease in the tax charge of 1 million.

IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 21 1 Adjusted EPS DPS pence per share 1 Adjusted Operating Profit m OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW United Kingdom We delivered a good performance, building on the progress we have made in recent years and consolidating our position as the undisputed market leader in cigarettes and fine cut tobacco.
Lambert & Butler Golden Virginia Richmond The UKs best selling cigarette An excellent performance The UKs second biggest brand family, with a 16% market from the UKs market leader cigarette brand family had an share.
MARKET DYNAMICS We estimate that the UK cigarette market was down by around 4 per cent to 51 billion cigarettes.
Consumer downtrading continued with growth in both the ultra low price cigarette and fine cut tobacco sectors.
We estimate the fine cut tobacco market grew to 3,000 tonnes 2004: 2,900 tonnes.
We operate in a highly regulated environment in which new point of sale advertising restrictions were introduced in December 2004.
The UK Governments Health Bill was published on 27 October 2005, and states that from the summer of 2007, smoking will be banned in all enclosed public places in England and Wales, apart from private members clubs and licensed premises that do not serve or prepare food.
We anticipate that in Scotland and Northern Ireland a ban on smoking in public places will be implemented on 26 March 2006 and by April 2007 respectively.
OUR PERFORMANCE We delivered a strong improvement in operating profits, up 5 per cent to 477 million as a result of price increases, growth in fine cut tobacco volumes and cost reductions.
Our results reflect the strength of our brand portfolio, which includes the UKs two best selling cigarette brand families, Lambert & Butler and Richmond.
Lambert & Butler performed well, maintaining 16.0 per cent of the market, whilst Richmond had an excellent year, growing its share by 1.5 percentage points to 14.7 per cent.
The combined brand families accounted for over 30 per cent of the UK market in 2005.
Reflecting market dynamics, our market shares of Regal, Embassy and Superkings declined slightly such that our total UK cigarette market share remained broadly stable at 44.5 per cent.
We increased our fine cut tobacco share to 66.3 per cent, with strong growth from Golden Virginia, the UK market leader.
Our excellent performance in this highly regulated environment reflects our continued investment in our skilled salesforce and supporting technology.
Our UK co-marketing and logistics agreement with Philip Morris was renegotiated for an additional five years.
OUTLOOK The UK market continues to make a major contribution to the Groups overall performance.
In the context of moderate market declines and current market sector trends, our strong brand portfolio means we are well placed to build on our market leadership positions in cigarette and fine cut tobacco and to further develop our profits.

West Davidoff JPS West remains the second Davidoff performed well in the An excellent performance largest cigarette brand in premium cigarette sector.
MARKET DYNAMICS Successive tax increases over the past few years continue to impact the overall market size in Germany and we estimate that the total tobacco market in 2005 was down by 4 per cent to 144 billion cigarette equivalents 2004: 150 billion.
The cigarette market decreased by 15 per cent to 101 billion cigarettes partially offset by strong growth in other tobacco products, up by 39 per cent, as consumers sought value brands and products.
Reflecting this trend, the low price branded cigarette sector continued to grow and accounted for 7.5 per cent of cigarette sales in September 2005.
The third and final stage of the current round of tobacco tax increases was introduced in September 2005, following those in March and December 2004.
We passed on this tax increase to consumers which, for the majority of our cigarette portfolio, entailed reducing pack sizes from 19 to 17 cigarettes and lowering prices by 20 euro cents.
In the case between the German Government and the European Court of Justice ECJ regarding the taxation of the Singles make your own product category, the Advocate General published his opinion in July stating that the Singles category should no longer be taxed as fine cut tobacco but at the same higher rate as cigarettes.
The ruling of the ECJ is expected on 10 November 2005.
OUR PERFORMANCE Despite a challenging trading environment, operating profit rose by 24 per cent to 295 million, due to growth in our cigarette share, increased other tobacco product volumes, price increases and the benefits of cost efficiencies in both manufacturing and trading.
We were pleased with the growth in our cigarette share up to 19.4 per cent 2004: 18.9 per cent.
The market share development of JPS was particularly impressive with the brand capturing 1.7 per cent of the cigarette market in the 18 months since its launch, finishing the year at 2.8 per cent.
Davidoff, Peter Stuyvesant and R1 all continued to perform well in the premium sector and West remained the second largest cigarette brand in Germany with market share of 8.5 per cent.
Within other tobacco products our volumes have grown strongly, largely driven by the growth in Singles, up by 36 per cent, although our annual market share in this sector declined to 24.2 per cent as a result of increased competitor activity.
In the second half our share stabilised reflecting good performances from JPS and the recently launched Fairwind.
OUTLOOK The German market will continue to be challenging and particularly if the awaited ECJ ruling is adverse, but we have prepared a variety of portfolio responses depending on the outcome.
Our flexible approach has ensured the improving profitability of our operations in Germany and we believe that this flexibility, combined with our broad product portfolio and our strength in value cigarettes and other tobacco products, will continue to mean we are well positioned.

REGIONAL DYNAMICS We estimate the annual regional cigarette market was down by 3 per cent, but the rate of decline slowed in the second half of the year.
The regional fine cut tobacco market declined by 2 per cent due to increased prices.
Consumers continued to economise, stimulating growth in the value segments of both cigarette and fine cut tobacco.
The debate on smoking in public places has intensified across the region this year most notably in Italy where further restrictions were introduced.
Our experience in Ireland bears out our view that there would be an initial market decline with the impact diminishing over time.
OUR PERFORMANCE The growth in our cigarette shares more than offset the market volume decline.
However operating profit was slightly down at 326 million reflecting the change in sales mix and downtrading within fine cut tobacco.
In the Netherlands, our cigarette market share grew to 4.9 per cent due to the strong performance of West and we introduced JPS Red and JPS Silver in June in the value segment to capitalise on the continued downtrading dynamic.
Our fine cut tobacco market share was impacted by downtrading: however, we have seen encouraging progress since we launched the value brands Zilver and Evergreen during the year.
Our domestic cigarette market share in Belgium improved in the second half of the year with an encouraging performance from Route 66.
In Ireland we grew cigarette market share to 25.0 per cent with growth in Superkings.
Although our overall cigarette share declined slightly in France to 3.3 per cent, we have strengthened our value offering by extending the JPS family.
We maintained our market leading position in the fine cut tobacco sector with our share at 29 per cent supported by a good performance by Interval.
In Greece, despite downtrading, Davidoff continued to perform strongly in the premium sector with 16 per cent volume growth and with the repositioning of West and the launch of Maxim Slims our market share rose to 7.0 per cent.
In Spain our market share grew to 5.1 per cent, mainly due to the success of the JPS brand family.
We are market leaders in the growing fine cut tobacco market and delivered a strong performance with Golden Virginia.
The benefits of investment in a new salesforce in Italy were reflected in our cigarette share which reached 1.6 per cent with growth from Peter Stuyvesant, Route 66 and West.
OUTLOOK Given the current regional dynamics, we believe the breadth of our product portfolio provides us with opportunities for future growth as we continue to strengthen our position in this region.

Conditions remain challenging across the region and we continue to focus on balancing profit and volume, with some encouraging recent brand launches of Paramount, Golden Gate and Moon.
In Eastern Europe, our volumes grew.
Highlights include our Russian market share, up to 5.3 per cent with growth in Maxim, our improved portfolio in the Ukraine with the newly introduced Classic and in the Caucasus, volumes rose by over 70 per cent.

In Africa, our profits grew with positive market share developments in Central and Western Africa, and in the Middle East, Davidoff continued to extend our regional presence with volumes up 27 per cent.
OUTLOOK There are encouraging opportunities for the Group in this region, given the broad spread of markets it encompasses.

 LLP Chartered Accountants and Registered Auditors Bristol 1 November 2005 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 38 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT The Board of Directors the Board remains committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance, which it sees as a cornerstone in managing the business affairs of the Group and a fundamental part of discharging its stewardship responsibilities.
Throughout the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report the Group has complied with the governance rules and best practice provisions applying to UK listed companies as set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code.
Since Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has securities registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC, the Group also complies with those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which are applicable to foreign issuers.
In the light of this ongoing obligation, a programme of activity is currently in place to enable the Group to meet the further requirements with regard to section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act, which will be applicable for our financial year ending 30 September 2006.
Corporate Governance Compliance The Board recognises that it is accountable to shareholders for the Groups standard of governance and seeks to maintain high standards in the management of the affairs of the Group, seeing it as a fundamental part of discharging its stewardship responsibilities.
Accordingly both the Board and the Audit Committee have continued to keep under review the Groups entire system of internal control, encompassing both financial and operational controls as well as compliance and risk management.
Based on these reviews the Board is satisfied that an appropriate internal control framework is in place across the whole Group.
As previously reported, certain investigations were initiated by German authorities in January 2003 into alleged foreign trading and related violations by Reemtsma employees during a period prior to its acquisition by the Group, which resulted in a number of such Reemtsma employees being named in search orders.
Elements of these investigations are continuing.
In May 2005, parts of the investigations into certain of the former Reemtsma employees were terminated by the authorities on terms agreed by the individuals with the authorities, and settlement of any duty payable as a result of certain of the activities being investigated was made at no cost to Reemtsma.
The Group confirms that no criminal charges have been brought against such individuals or Reemtsma in relation to the continuing investigations, which could take several years to be concluded.
A Board Committee, under the Chairmanship of Mr A G L Alexander, established in 2003, continues to monitor the progress and conduct of the investigations on a regular basis and the Groups responses on behalf of the Board.
The German authorities investigations are based on alleged activities prior to the Groups acquisition of Reemtsma and the Committee remains satisfied that, since the acquisition, the Group has not been involved in any activities of a nature similar to those alleged by the German authorities.
As previously reported, information was supplied by Imperial Tobacco and a number of other companies to the UK Office of Fair Trading the OFT in October 2003 in relation to an enquiry into the operations of the UK tobacco supply chain.
Further information was supplied in April 2005 but to date no response to the information submitted has been received from the OFT.
Board and Board Committees The Board of Directors, which meets at least five times a year, currently comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, seven other independent NonExecutive Directors and five Executive Directors, with a clear separation of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive to ensure an appropriate balance of power and authority.
Ms S E Murray and Mr C R Day joined the Board on 8 December 2004 and 25 July 2005 respectively as Non-Executive Directors, having been identified as suitable candidates for appointment by an external search consultancy.
On 9 February 2005 Mr B C Davidson resigned from the Board as Sales and Marketing Director.
His responsibilities for the Groups global sales and marketing activities have been transferred to Mr G L Blashill who was appointed to the Board on 28 October 2005.
As already announced Messrs S P Duffy and S Huismans will be retiring from the Board at the Annual General Meeting the AGM in January 2006.
It is proposed that Mr A G L Alexander will remain on the Board beyond the AGM in 2006 in order to facilitate a smooth transition at senior Board level.
It is also proposed that Mr I J G Napier who was appointed Joint Vice Chairman in December 2004 will become the senior independent Non-Executive Director with effect from the AGM in 2006.
The Board considers that all seven Non-Executive Directors excluding the Chairman are independent for the purposes of the Code and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
During the year, in accordance with the Code and with the assistance of an external consultant, the Board formally reviewed and evaluated its performance, together with the performance of its committees and individual directors.
In addition Mr A G L Alexander met with the Non-Executive Directors as a group, without the Chairman present, to consider the performance of the Chairman.
The Chairman additionally held meetings exclusively with the Non-Executive Directors to consider the performance of the Executive Directors.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 39 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT Board and Board Committees continued Following the disclosure of individual Directors external commitments, as part of the Board performance evaluation conducted during the year, the Board accepted that Mr D W Thursfields increasing level of external commitments was likely to have an adverse impact on his availability for Board and committee matters.
As a consequence the Board accepted Mr D W Thursfields resignation with effect from 28 October 2005.
Over the coming months the Board will be seeking to appoint one or more additional Non-Executive Directors to ensure that the Board and its committees continue to remain suitably balanced.
Remuneration Committee The membership and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are contained in the Directors Remuneration Report which appears on page 43.
Such report, which has been approved by the Board and signed by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, outlines remuneration strategy and policy, details of the Committees activities over the financial year and contains full details of Directors emoluments.
Nominations Committee The Nominations Committee, comprising all the Non-Executive Directors and the Chief Executive who will be stepping down from the Committee following the AGM, with Mr D C Bonham as Chairman, met twice during the year.
Mr M R Phillips the Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Responsibilities of the Committee include the evaluation of the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of the Board, the development of role specifications, the formulation of succession plans and the making of recommendations to the Board with regard to the appointment of Directors.
New Directors appointed by the Board must submit themselves for re-election by shareholders at the AGM following their appointment.
Thereafter all Directors, in accordance with the Code, are subject to re-election at least every three years.
Any Director serving in excess of nine years is subject to annual re-election.
The training needs in respect of new appointments to the Board are assessed and, as appropriate, induction arrangements put in place.
Existing Directors are encouraged to undertake such professional development as considered necessary to assist them in carrying out their duties as directors.
Audit Committee The Audit Committee, consisting exclusively of independent Non-Executive Directors, Mr A G L Alexander who will be stepping down from the Committee with effect from the AGM, Mr I J G Napier, Dr P H Jungels, with Mr S P Duffy who is retiring at the AGM as Chairman, met four times during the year.
All its members, with the exception of Dr P H Jungels, are qualified accountants or have held senior finance positions in PLCs and are therefore well qualified to discharge the responsibilities that Audit Committee membership entails and are regarded as financial experts for the purposes of both the Code and section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Following the retirement of Mr S P Duffy at the AGM it is proposed that Mr C R Day will become a member of and assume the chairmanship of the Audit Committee.
It is also proposed that following the AGM Ms S E Murray will become a member of the Audit Committee.
The Committees terms of reference cover the matters recommended by the Code.
Its duties included monitoring internal control throughout the Group, approving the Groups accounting policies and reviewing the interim and annual financial statements together with the US filing on Form 20F, before submission to the full Board.
The Committee reviews and approves, on an annual basis, the scope and content of the risk assessment and compliance programme implemented by the Group Compliance Function and monitors and critically reviews the authority, effectiveness and level of resource allocated to the activity.
The Finance Director, the Director of Finance and Planning, the Groups General Manager Compliance and other financial management attend each meeting of the Committee by invitation.
The Groups Auditors also attend each meeting.
Standing items on each agenda allow for the General Manager Compliance and then the Auditors to meet formally with the Committee without any Executive Director or other manager being present.
The Group has maintained and regularly reviews its Auditor Independence Policy document, which provides clear definitions of services that the external Auditors can and cannot provide such that their independence and objectivity are not impaired.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 40 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT Internal control The Board acknowledges responsibility for the Groups system of internal control.
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, reviews the effectiveness of the system in accordance with the guidance set out in Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code the Turnbull guidance from information and regular reports provided by management, the internally independent Group Compliance Function and external Auditors.
However, given the size and complexity of the Groups operations, such a system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of meeting internal control objectives by managing rather than eliminating risk.
The Board, either directly or through the Audit Committee which reports its findings for consideration by the Board, regularly reviews the effectiveness of the key procedures which have been established to provide internal control and confirms that an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Groups significant risks operated throughout the year and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report.
The following key features have operated to provide reassurance of both the reliability of information and the safeguarding of assets: Risk assessment A detailed assessment of strategic risks is undertaken by the Executive Directors as part of the medium-term planning and annual and monthly forecasting reporting cycles.
The Audit Committee has delegated responsibility for considering Group-wide operational, financial and compliance risks on a regular basis.
All areas of the business are required to undertake risk-profiling exercises to formally review their principal areas of risk so that all major risks are reviewed at all levels across the Group.
This formal system is based on the annual submission of risk assessment summaries from each of the business operations identifying their major areas of business risk together with the controls embedded in the business processes to mitigate such risks.
Control environment and control activities The Group is organised on a functional basis with manufacturing, sales and marketing and central support functions each having their own management and control structures which satisfy the Groups controls, accounting policies and regulatory responsibilities.
Clearly defined lines of responsibility with appropriate delegations of authority and segregation of duties exist, with personnel of the necessary calibre in place to fulfil their roles.
The Board has formally adopted and recently reviewed a schedule of matters of a strategic, financial, operational and compliance nature, which are required to be brought to it for decision and has established a framework of policies and procedures to which personnel are expected to comply.
A formal policy and arrangements for dealing in confidence with issues of genuine and significant concern raised by employees or others relating to perceived malpractice, improper business practices, management impropriety or other similar matters, whether financial or non-financial commonly referred to as whistleblowing arrangements operates throughout the Group.
Information and communication Each area of the business is required to produce detailed financial plans prior to the start of each financial year, which are reviewed for robustness and realism.
Major variances against these plans are promptly and thoroughly investigated and the achievement of business objectives, both financial and non-financial, is also assessed on a regular basis.
Monitoring A range of procedures is used to review the risk profile and monitor the effective application of internal controls across the Group.
These include independent reviews by the Group Compliance Function together with self-assessment of risks and relevant controls.
Furthermore both the senior operational and financial managers of each business and function annually certify that effective systems of internal control have been maintained within their area of responsibility.
In line with recommendations issued by the US SEC and to meet developing corporate governance best practice in the UK, the Group has also established a Disclosure Committee comprising appropriate senior executives to assist the Chief Executive, Finance Director and, as appropriate, the Audit Committee, in their evaluation of material issues for the purposes of the Groups disclosure obligations.
The Audit Committee confirms it has reviewed and reported to the Board on the system of internal control for the financial year ended 30 September 2005 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report.
This was achieved through the procedural and reporting framework for monitoring business risks and controls, as outlined out above, and review of the Groups financial statements.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 41 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT Going concern The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to meet its operational needs for the foreseeable future.
Pension fund The Groups main pension fund, the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund, is not controlled by the Board but by Trustees, consisting of five nominees from the Company, one member chosen by employees and two by current and deferred pensioners.
The Trustees look after the assets of the pension fund, which are held separately from those of the Group and are managed by independent fund managers.
The pension fund assets can only be used in accordance with its Rules and for no other purpose.
New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements As a listed non-US issuer, the Group is required to comply with some of the New York Stock Exchanges NYSE listing standards relating to the corporate governance practices of listed companies, being exempt from others.
However there is an obligation to disclose any significant ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from those followed by US companies under the NYSE listing standards.
At this time, the Group believes that it is in compliance, in all material respects, with the relevant NYSE listing standards.
However, in respect of the NYSE standards relating to the composition of a Nomination Corporate Governance Committee, it is currently the Groups practice to include the Chief Executive, in addition to all of the Non-Executive Directors, on the Nominations Committee.
However he will step down from the Committee with effect from the forthcoming AGM.
Furthermore it is the Board, not this Committee, that develops, recommends and adopts the corporate governance principles to be applied throughout the Group.
It should also be noted that the role of an internal audit department is incorporated within the general remit of the internally independent Group Compliance Function.
Communication with shareholders Communication with all shareholders is given a high priority and a number of methods are used to promote greater understanding and dialogue with investment audiences.
All material documents including the Annual Report and Form 20F together with announcements, investor presentations and share price information are available online through the Imperial Tobacco website www.
Additionally, there is an opportunity at the Annual General Meeting for individual shareholders to question the Chairman and the chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees.
Historically the Group has indicated the level of proxy votes lodged in respect of each resolution proposed at its AGMs, together with the number of votes for and against each such resolution including details of abstentions, following each vote on a show of hands.
Subsequently the results were also published on the Companys website.
For the 2006 AGM onwards all resolutions at the AGM will be put to a poll, the result of which will be announced after the conclusion of the meeting through a Regulatory Information Service release and on the Companys website.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 42 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT This Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee, in accordance with schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and to meet the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.

Alithos Limited provides no other services for the Group.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 43 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Responsibilities The Board is ultimately responsible for the framework and cost of executive remuneration but has delegated to the Remuneration Committee responsibility for the following activities: Determining the remuneration levels and conditions of service for Executive Directors and members of the Chief Executives Committee: Overseeing the overall policy for senior management remuneration: and Overseeing the Groups employee share or cash based incentive schemes including approval of minor rule amendments, invitations and awards and the allocation or issue of shares or payments under any such schemes.
The Committees approach is fully consistent with the Groups overall remuneration strategy and philosophy that all employees should be competitively rewarded to attract and retain their valued skills in the business, as well as supporting corporate strategy, by directly aligning executive management with the Groups strategic business goals.
Remuneration strategy Imperial Tobacco Group PLC operates in an increasingly competitive, international environment.
For the Group to continue to compete successfully it is essential that the level of remuneration and benefits offered achieves the objectives of attracting, developing, retaining and motivating the necessary high quality pool of talented employees, at all levels, across the Group.
The Group therefore sets out to provide competitive remuneration to all its employees, appropriate to the business environment in those countries in which it operates.
As the Group develops internationally and integrates acquisitions, it continues to need to relocate employees from country to country as the requirements of the business dictate and has developed its remuneration arrangements accordingly.
The remuneration strategy is therefore designed not only to align with the Groups fundamental values of fairness, competitiveness and equity but also to support the Groups corporate strategy, as a significant contributor to its competitive advantage.
A cohesive reward structure across the Group is seen as critical in ensuring that all employees can associate with and strive for the Groups strategic goals.
This structure is consistently applied to all employees and well communicated to ensure each element of the package is understood and the links to corporate performance recognised.
To assist in this communication senior employees are issued with total reward statements.
The Group also seeks to align the interests of shareholders and employees at all levels by giving employees opportunities and encouragement to build a shareholding in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC.
Through a series of share plan initiatives, Sharesave arrangements and Share Matching Schemes, the vast majority of employees of the Company and its subsidiaries have been offered participation in one or more equity-based plans with in excess of 40 per cent of the eligible population taking advantage of those invitations.
Executive remuneration policy The remuneration package for Executive Directors and members of the Chief Executives Committee, as determined by the Remuneration Committee, is designed to attract and retain high quality executives, induce loyalty and motivate them to achieve a high level of corporate performance in line with the best interests of shareholders, while not being excessive.
The package is also in line with the Groups overall strategy, as detailed above, on pay and benefits and, as the Group extends its business internationally, it takes account of market practices outside the UK where the scope of a particular executives role warrants this approach.
The executive remuneration policy combines short term and long term rewards, focusing on performance-related elements that take into account individual, functional and corporate performance.
The main components are base salary, annual cash bonus, share matching scheme SMS, long-term incentive plan LTIP and pension benefits, with an increased weighting towards performance-related variable reward elements.
In the financial year to September 2005, base salary typically represented around 26 per cent of total remuneration for the Chief Executive and Finance Director and around 35 per cent of total remuneration for the other Executive Directors with annual bonus and awards vesting under SMS and LTIP schemes making up the balance.
Following approval of the revised share plans by shareholders at the 2005 AGM, for the financial year to September 2006 base pay will represent around 20 per cent of Executive Directors potential remuneration.
The executive remuneration policy is set to provide base salary at around the median level of its comparator group while providing the Executive Directors and Chief Executives Committee members with the capacity to earn upper quartile total compensation on achievement of superior business performance.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 44 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Percentage of Total Remuneration for the financial year to 30 September 2005 Mr G Davis Mr R Dyrbus Mr D Cresswell Dr F A Rogerson 0 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Salary Benefits Bonus SMS LTIP From the financial year to September 2004, more stringent performance criteria have been and continue to be applied to the performance-related elements as detailed in the annual cash bonus and LTIP sections below and on page 48 both of which form part of this policy statement.
In August 2005 the Remuneration Committee reviewed its executive remuneration policy, including reward policies, performance criteria, relevant comparator groups and vesting schedules and is satisfied that these remain appropriate and support the strategy and objectives of the Group, including the creation of shareholder value.
Base salary Base salary is reviewed annually and is determined by the Remuneration Committee following detailed consideration of a number of factors including individual responsibilities, performance and external market data.
It is set within a range around the market median of the comparator group to reflect the experience, responsibility, effectiveness and market value of the relevant executive.
The comparator group of companies chosen remains the FTSE 50 excluding companies in the Financial and Pharmaceutical sectors.
Base salary is the only element of the package used to determine pensionable earnings.
Annual cash bonus During the period under review, bonus targets related principally to the achievement of Group profit objectives set at the beginning of the financial year.
However, the specific targets are not disclosed since they are considered to be commercially confidential.
For the financial year ended 30 September 2005 the potential maximum bonus was 100 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive and 2 Finance Director and 75 per cent for other Executive Directors.
For all Executive Directors potential bonus representing 66 3 per cent of base salary related to achievement of profit based performance criteria.
The attainment of bonus in excess of this level was subject to achievement of additional stretching and incremental performance criteria.
Performance in the financial year has resulted in bonuses, as detailed in the table on page 47, being awarded to Executive Directors.
These payments represented 76.6 per cent of base salary in respect of the Chief Executive and Finance Director and 69.6 per cent in respect of the other Executive Directors.
Cash bonuses were also earned by other senior executives for achieving performance targets for the financial year to 30 September 2005.
For the financial year ended 30 September 2006 the Remuneration Committee has determined that the potential maximum bonus is 100 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive and Finance Director and 75 per cent per cent for other Executive Directors.
For all Executive Directors 2 potential bonus representing 66 3 per cent of base salary is related to achievement of profit based performance criteria.
The attainment of bonus in excess of this level is subject to achievement of additional stretching and incremental performance criteria.
No element of the bonus is guaranteed.
The Executive Directors may elect to invest some or all of their gross bonus in the SMS as detailed on page 51.

There have been no changes in any Directors holdings since 30 September 2005.
Executive share retention To ensure the interests of management remain aligned with those of shareholders, Executive Directors and senior executives are required to meet minimum shareholding guidelines, by building, over a period of five years from appointment, a holding in the Groups shares to a current minimum value broadly equivalent to three times base salary for the Chief Executive and Finance Director and twice their base salary in respect of the other Executive Directors.
Other executives are expected to invest at a level equivalent to between once and twice their base salary, dependent upon grade.
Failure to meet the minimum shareholding is a factor taken into account when determining eligibility for future LTIP awards.
All Executive Directors currently exceed their required shareholding.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Each year since demerger in 1996, annual awards worth 75 per cent of basic salary have been made to Executive Directors under the LTIP and awards at a lower level have been made to other senior executives.
The awards, which vest three years after grant, are subject to the satisfaction of an applicable performance criterion, as set out below, over a three-year performance period.
All grants are at the absolute discretion of the Remuneration Committee and no employee has a right to receive any such grant.
For the December 2000 to November 2004 awards, the Committee replaced total shareholder return TSR with earnings per share EPS growth as the performance criterion.
This was seen as enhancing the incentive effect of the LTIP by focusing on the financial performance of the business, over which Directors and executives have power to influence.
The LTIP Rules give the Committee absolute discretion to ensure that the EPS performance criterion fully reflects the underlying performance of the Group before any awards vest, including maintenance of long-term return on capital employed.
This discretion gives the Committee the power to reduce, but not increase, the extent to which the award vests.
Outstanding awards vest on a sliding scale depending on average growth in basic EPS adjusted for amortisation, based on an agreed protocol to allow appropriate adjustments for exceptional and extraordinary items.
The adjustments are confirmed by the Auditors after adjusting for inflation over the period of the award.
No vesting occurs unless the Companys average real EPS growth is positive.
Full vesting occurs if average real EPS growth is equal to or exceeds 10 per cent per annum.
Between these two points the award vests on a straight-line basis.
In order to ensure that the performance criterion remained challenging the lower threshold was raised in 2003.
Therefore, for the 2003 and 2004 awards, vesting will only occur if average real EPS growth exceeds three per cent per annum.
The upper threshold of 10 per cent per annum real average EPS growth remained unchanged.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 48 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP continued On vesting, a participant is granted a nil cost option to acquire the relevant number of shares.
The option may be exercised at any time up to the seventh anniversary of its date of grant.
There is no opportunity to re-test if the performance criterion is not achieved.
Under the LTIP rules, should Imperial Tobacco Group PLC be acquired, the performance period would come to an end on the date of acquisition.
Any outstanding awards would vest on a time pro-rata basis, subject to the achievement of the applicable performance criteria.
Performance criteria will be adjusted to ensure consistent measurement during the transition to IFRS.
Following the remuneration review in 2004, and subsequent approval by shareholders at the 2005 AGM, the Remuneration Committee has determined that annual awards equivalent to twice salary in respect of the Chief Executive, one and a half times salary for the Finance Director and once salary for other Executive Directors will be made in November 2005, with the performance criteria split into three elements as follows: First element 50 per cent of the award with a performance criterion based on EPS as described above, with 12.5 per cent of this element vesting if average real annual EPS growth equals three per cent and 100 per cent of this element vesting if average real annual EPS growth equals or exceeds 10 per cent.
Between these two points awards vest on a straight-line basis.
Second element 25 per cent of the award with a performance criterion based on TSR relative to the FTSE 100 Index as described below.
The performance criterion for the second element will be based on a sliding scale depending on TSR achieved over the period of the award.
No vesting of this element will occur unless the Companys total shareholder return ranks it in the top 50 of the companies constituting the FTSE 100 Index.
At this performance threshold 30 per cent of this element will vest.
If the return ranks the Company in the top 25 of the Index, this element will vest in full.
Between these thresholds the award will vest on a straight-line basis.
Third element 25 per cent of the award with a performance criterion based on TSR relative to a bespoke comparator group also described below.
The performance criterion for the third element will also be based on a sliding scale depending on TSR achieved over the period of the award.
No vesting of this element will occur unless the Companys TSR exceeds that of the bottom six companies constituting a bespoke comparator group comprising of 12 tobacco and alcohol companies as detailed in the table below.
At this performance threshold, 30 per cent of the third element will vest.
If the return ranks the Company in the top three of the comparator group, this element will vest in full.
Altadis S A Altria Group Inc British American Tobacco PLC Carlsberg A S Diageo PLC Gallaher Group PLC Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Interbrew SA Pernod Ricard SA Reynolds American Inc SABMiller PLC Scottish & Newcastle PLC If one of the comparator group companies is acquired prior to the granting of an award, a suitable replacement will be made.
Allied Domecq PLC, a company included in the comparator group approved at the 2005 AGM, has been acquired by Pernod Ricard SA who replace them in the comparator group.
For any corporate actions affecting a comparator company during an award period the current intention would be to mirror the actions of a passive investor, e. g. for an equity bid the new shares offered in exchange for the original company would be held for the remainder of the award period.
The TSR calculations will use share prices averaged over a period of three months to determine both the initial and closing prices rather than those ruling on a single day.
It is assumed that the cash flow of dividend payments is recognised on the date the shares are declared ex dividend.
This method is considered to give a fairer and less volatile result since improved performance has to be sustained for several weeks before it effectively impacts on the TSR calculations.
All share prices and dividend flows will be converted to sterling on the applicable date to ensure that the calculations reflect the return achievable by a UK based investor.
The TSR calculations themselves will be performed independently by Alithos Limited and approval sought from the Remuneration Committee prior to the TRS elements vesting.
There will be no opportunity to re-test if any of the performance criteria are not achieved.
Each element will operate independently and will be capable of vesting regardless of the Companys performance in respect of the other elements.
However, the Remuneration Committee may vary, but not increase, the extent to which the award vests to ensure that it only vests, and at an appropriate level, if there has been an improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company, including the maintenance of long-term return on capital employed.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 49 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT In setting three elements to the performance criteria for LTIP awards, the Remuneration Committee decided that these were the most important measures that drive or measure sustainable improvement in shareholder value.
The TSR criteria reflect comparative performance against the appropriate FTSE sector and a bespoke comparator group of companies.
The EPS criterion reflects a key part of the Groups strategy to create sustainable shareholder value.
Under the LTIP rules, should Imperial Tobacco be acquired, the performance period would come to an end on the date of acquisition.
On vesting, a participant is granted a nil cost option to acquire the relevant number of shares.
It is anticipated that the first awards on the basis set out above will be made during November 2005.
An amendment to the LTIP Rules will be proposed at the 2006 AGM to remove the current rule that no award can be granted within three years of the Plan retirement date currently age 65 and replace this with a rule that no awards can be made within six months of expected retirement.
Further details of the proposed amendment are contained in the accompanying notice of the 2006 AGM.
During the year, the November 2001 November 2004 award vested in full.
Annual growth in EPS over the period averaged 21.77 per cent exceeding the average of 10 per cent, the threshold at which the award maximises.
There have been no changes in any Directors awards since 30 September 2005.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 50 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Executive Directors conditional share awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan continued In respect of the November 2002 November 2005 award, based on EPS to the end of the financial year, 100 per cent of the award will vest on 25 November 2005.
For illustrative purposes only, the share price on 28 October 2005, being the latest practicable date prior to publication, was 15.91 valuing the awards as follows: Award vesting Award vesting Award lapsing no.

The Remuneration Committee regards the November 2003 November 2006 and the November 2004 November 2007 awards to be too distant from maturity to be included in the value projected above.
However, in respect of these awards, the adjusted average EPS has grown by more than 10 per cent per annum in real terms in the performance period to the end of September 2005 and, therefore, if this performance were maintained over the relevant performance periods both awards would vest in full, their illustrative values based on the above share price are as follows.

Share Matching Scheme SMS Annual Scheme Under the SMS, the Remuneration Committee, at its absolute discretion, invites Executive Directors and most of the Groups management to invest any proportion, up to a maximum of 100 per cent, of their gross bonus in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Ordinary Shares to be held by a nominee controlled by the Employee Benefit Trust.
Provided that the shares lodged are left with the nominee for three years, they will be matched on a one for one basis.
However, in respect of investments made by Executive Directors under the SMS from their bonus paid in December 2003, and for future years, a performance criterion will be applied to the matched shares such that matching will only occur if the Group has achieved in excess of an average three per cent real increase in EPS per annum over the three year retention period, being an indicator of sustained ongoing profit delivery.
Achievement measurement is based on the same protocol as that applying to the LTIP.
There is no opportunity to re-test if this performance criterion is not met.
In setting the performance criterion for SMS awards, the Remuneration Committee decided that EPS reflects a key part of the Groups strategy to create sustainable shareholder value.
Under the scheme rules, should Imperial Tobacco be acquired, the performance period would come to an end on the date of acquisition.
Any outstanding awards would vest on a time pro-rata basis, subject to the achievement of any applicable performance criterion.
The performance criterion will be adjusted to ensure consistent measurement during the transition to IFRS.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 51 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Centenary Scheme To encourage employees to acquire and retain a shareholding, and to mark the centenary of the founding of The Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland Limited, all employees of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries employed on 10 December 2001, the date of the centenary, were invited to purchase up to 3,000 worth of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Ordinary Shares and lodge them with the Employee Benefit Trust.
Provided these shares are left in the Trust, the lodged shares will be matched on a sliding scale from 20 per cent for one years retention to a maximum of 100 per cent if they are retained for the full five years to August 2007.
There have been no changes in any Directors contingent rights since 30 September 2005.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 52 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Executive Directors contingent rights to shares under the Share Matching Scheme continued During the year, annual bonuses earned in 2000 2001 and lodged under the SMS for a three-year period matured in January 2005, providing matched shares for participants on a 1:1 basis.
In respect of annual bonuses earned in 2003 2004, the Executive Directors elected to invest their entire bonus in January 2005 in the form of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Ordinary Shares under the SMS.
These will be matched with additional shares, equal in number to the original shares, provided they are both left in the SMS for three years and if the Company has achieved in excess of an average of three per cent real increase in EPS per annum over the retention period.
These additional shares are shown within contingent rights above.
It is anticipated that the Executive Directors will again invest their entire bonus in February 2006 in the form of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Ordinary Shares under the SMS.
Share options The Company does not operate an executive share option scheme.
However, Executive Directors are eligible along with all employees of the Company and any participating subsidiary of the Group to participate in Imperial Tobacco Group PLCs savings-related Sharesave Plan.
Under this Plan options are granted, at a discount of up to 20 per cent to the closing mid-market price on the day prior to invitation, to participants who have contracted to save up to 250 per month over a period of three or five years.
There were no aggregate gains during the year 2004: 5,694.
2 Any option not exercised by the end of the range of exercisable dates will expire.
3 Or date of resignation from the Board if earlier.
4 No options were granted to or exercised by the Directors during the year.
There have been no changes in any Directors share options since 30 September 2005.
The Companys middle market share price at the close of business on 30 September 2005 was 16.24 and the range of the middle market price during the year was 12.25 to 16.24.
Full details of the Directors share interests are available for inspection in the Register of Directors Interests at the Companys registered office.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 53 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Employee Benefit Trust The Imperial Tobacco Group Employee and Executive Benefit Trust the Executive Trust and the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2001 Employee Benefit Trust the 2001 Trust have been established to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company, by subscription or purchase, from funds provided by the Group to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise of share options and on the vesting of the SMS and LTIP awards.
As potential beneficiaries of the Executive Trust, each of the Executive Directors is deemed to have a contingent interest in the 929,837 Ordinary Shares of the Company held by that Trust at 30 September 2005.
Details of the shareholdings by the Employee Benefit Trusts are as follows: Balance Purchased Distributed Balance Shares under at during during at Award at Surplus 1 1 10 2004 year year 30 9 2005 30 9 2005 Shortfall Executive Trust 828,432 353,073 251,668 929,837 876,241 53,596 2001 Trust 3,235,921 359,727 1,498,948 2,096,700 5,258,773 3,162,073 1 As at 30 September 2005, the Company also held 13,515,000 shares in Treasury which could be used to satisfy awards under the share plans.
Share Plan Flow Rates The Companys policy has always been to satisfy all awards under its share schemes from market purchased shares through the Trusts.
The Trust Deeds and the Rules of all schemes contain provisions limiting awards to five per cent in five years and 10 per cent in 10 years for all employee schemes with an additional restriction to five per cent in 10 years for executive schemes.
Currently an aggregate total of only 0.9 per cent of the Companys issued share capital is subject to awards under all the Groups executive and all employee share schemes.
In future the Trust may also be provided with shares held by the Company in Treasury in order to satisfy vesting awards.
Since demerger in 1996 the cumulative awards under all of the Companys share plans totals under 2.7 per cent of its issued share capital.
Following initial grants on demerger, subsequent annual grants have averaged 0.3 per cent of issued share capital.
Executive Directors Pensions The Executive Directors are all members of the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund, the principal defined benefit scheme operated by the Group.
For members who joined prior to 1 April 2002 the fund is non-contributory with a normal retirement age of 60.
The fund allows members to achieve the maximum pension of two-thirds of their salary at normal retirement age after 32 years service.
Pension commutation to enable participants to receive a lump sum on retirement is permitted within Inland Revenue limits.
For death before retirement, a capital sum equal to four times salary is payable together with a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members expected pension at retirement.
For death in retirement, a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members pre-commutation pension is payable.
Dependant children will also receive allowances.
Pensions increase by the lesser of 10 per cent and the increase in Retail Price Index, together with an option under the rules to surrender part of a pension for pension increases in line with the general index of retail prices of up to 15 per cent.
All Executive Directors earn benefits on the standard scale with a normal retirement age of 60.
The Remuneration Committee is reviewing its policy for current Executive Directors pensions in light of proposed UK legislation due to be published in November 2005.
Once this legislation has been finalised the Remuneration Committee intends to conclude its review.
Simultaneously the Remuneration Committee will be reviewing its policy for future Executive Directors in light of the final legislation, market competitiveness and its overall remuneration policy.
The following table provides the information required by both the Listing Rules and schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and gives details for each Director of: the annual accrued pension payable from normal retirement age, calculated as if he had left service at the year end: the increase in accrued pension during the year, excluding any increases for inflation in respect of the disclosure required under the Listing Rules: and the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension calculated in accordance with the actuarial guidance note GN11.
None of the Directors has made additional voluntary contributions.

2 In respect of Mr G Davis and Dr F A Rogerson, their accrued pension and transfer values of accrued pension at 1 October 2004 included a small historic pensionable car allowance which was waived, without compensation, by them during the year.
3 Restated to reflect recalculation of transfer values at 1 October 2004.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual Director.
Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
Benefits The principal taxable benefits for Executive Directors are the provision of cars and health insurance.
Remuneration from other Non-Executive Directorships The Company recognises that external non-executive directorships are beneficial for both the Executive Director concerned and the Company.
Executive Directors are permitted, at the discretion of the Board, to retain fees received in respect of any such non-executive directorship.
Each serving Executive Director is restricted to one external non-executive directorship and may not serve as chairman of a FTSE 100 company.
Mr G Davis serves on the Board of Wolseley PLC and currently receives fees of 58,000 per annum.
Executive Directors Service Agreements It is the Groups policy to appoint Executive Directors under service agreements terminable by either party giving 52 weeks notice, as shown in the table below.
The service agreement of Mr G L Blashill, who was appointed to the Board on 28 October 2005, is terminable by either party giving a maximum of 52 weeks notice.
There are no predetermined provisions for compensation on termination within Executive Directors service agreements.
However, the Group is unequivocally against rewards for failure.
The circumstances of the termination and an individuals duty and opportunity to mitigate loss are taken into account in every case.
The Groups policy is to stop or reduce compensatory payments to former Directors to the extent that they receive remuneration from other employment during the compensation period.
Under the rules of the LTIP and SMS, outstanding awards vest on termination for certain reasons, such as death, retirement, redundancy or on a change of control, on a time-related pro-rata basis subject to satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria.
If, however, the termination of employment is for a reason other than one of those specified in the rules an individuals full award lapses.

Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors Fees for Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole with regard to market practice and within the restrictions contained in the Companys Articles of Association.
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The Non-Executive Directors do not take part in discussions on their own remuneration.
They receive no other material pay or benefits with the exception of reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with their directorship of the Company and provision of administrative support including the use of Company offices by the Chairman Mr D C Bonham and Joint Vice Chairman Mr A G L Alexander, do not participate in the Companys share schemes, bonus schemes or incentive plans and are not eligible for pension scheme membership.
To align further the interest of the Non-Executive Directors with those of shareholders, it was agreed that a proportion of their fees be applied, after tax, to purchase shares in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC.
These shares are to be held by a nominee during the term of each Non-Executive Directorship.
Exceptionally in respect of Mr D C Bonham and Mr A G L Alexander, this requirement has been waived due to their continued level of investment, as detailed above.
Furthermore given the impending retirement, at the forthcoming AGM, of Messrs S P Duffy and S Huismans this requirement has also been waived in respect of their emoluments paid during the financial year commencing 1 October 2005.
Mr S Huismans is also a member of Supervisory Boards within the Reemtsma Group for which he received additional remuneration for fulfilling such non-executive roles.
Non-Executive Directors Letters of Appointment The Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements with the Company.
The terms of their appointments are reviewed annually and upon them reaching 65 years of age.
These terms were reviewed for all Non-Executive Directors and confirmed on 1 February 2005.
The letters of appointment are available for viewing at the Companys registered office during normal business hours and prior to and at the AGM.
Under the terms of the Articles of Association of the Company, Non-Executive Directors stand for reappointment at the first Annual General Meeting following appointment, are subject to triennial reappointment by shareholders and retire subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 at the Annual General Meeting following their reaching 70 years of age.
There are no provisions in their letters of appointment regarding notice periods or compensation on early termination.
The letters of appointment detail the time commitment expected of each Non-Executive Director.
Although there is no current maximum term of appointment for Non-Executive Directors, the Board is supportive of the best practice provisions contained in the Code.
Messrs S P Duffy and S Huismans will be retiring from the Board at the AGM in February 2006, having both been on the Board since demerger in August 1996.
However where the Board considers a Non-Executive Director is making a particularly valuable contribution they may be invited to remain on the Board in excess of nine years.
In such instances the length of tenure of the Non-Executive Director would be relevant to the Companys deliberations as to the independence of the Non-Executive Director and he she would also be subject to annual reelection at the AGM.
Such re-elections will be subject to the overall independence of the Board not being compromised.
It is proposed that Messrs D C Bonham and A G L Alexander, who have also been on the Board since demerger in August 1996, will continue to serve on the Board and will therefore offer themselves for re-election annually.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 56 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Remuneration Arrangements for Former Directors Mr S T Painter Following his retirement in May 2000, Mr S T Painter entered into a consultancy agreement with Imperial Tobacco Limited, the Groups principal operating company.
The agreement, as amended in October 2001 and May 2004, runs to March 2007.
Under the terms of the agreement he provides consultancy services as required and receives fees at a day rate of 1,000 with a minimum fee based on 100 days service for each 12 month period ending on 30 June, and 67 days for the period 1 July 2006 to 6 March 2007.
The agreement is terminable by either party giving 12 months notice.
He is also entitled to reimbursement for the use of his car.
Mr Painter is also a member of Supervisory Boards within the Reemtsma Group for which he receives additional remuneration for fulfilling such non-executive roles.
Mr M A Hussler In respect of Mr M A Hussler, subsequent to his resignation as a Director of the Company with effect from 9 July 2003, he remained as an employee receiving his full contractual remuneration until his resignation from the Company on 30 April 2005.
His base salary included the payment of a pension allowance of 5,980 which was neither eligible for bonus nor share schemes and was not pensionable.
Mr Hussler is currently in receipt of an annual retirement pension, that has been reduced because it has been taken before he reached his normal retirement age.
His service agreement with the Group provided that he would receive similar overall pension benefits to those that he would have received had he remained in the Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH pension arrangement.
This was, broadly, a pension for life equivalent to 42 per cent of his fixed annual salary at age 63.
For death in retirement, a spouses pension for life of 60 per cent of that amount would be payable.
The pension is made up of three parts: one part of the pension is payable from the unfunded pension arrangement of Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, another part is payable from the separately funded Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund and the difference, which is not separately pre-funded, is paid by the Company.
The pension payable under the Reemtsma arrangement and from the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund may be increased annually in accordance with the rules of those arrangements or as is required by law.
Mr B C Davidson In respect of Mr B C Davidson, subsequent to his resignation as a Director of the Company on 9 February 2005, he remained an employee receiving his full contractual remuneration until he left the Company on 30 April 2005.

Such principles differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States US GAAP.
A summary of principal differences and additional disclosures applicable to the Group is set out below.
Explanation In s million reference 2005 2004 Profit attributable to shareholders under UK GAAP 570 445 US GAAP adjustments: Pensions i 10 3 Amortisation of goodwill ii 198 196 Amortisation of brands trade marks licences ii 100 99 Deferred taxation iii 42 57 Mark to market adjustments due to non designation of hedge accounting per SFAS 133 iv 35 50 Employee share schemes charge to the profit and loss account vi 5 9 Net income under US GAAP 680 543 Explanation In pence reference 2005 2004 Amounts in accordance with US GAAP Basic net income per ordinary share vii 94.2 75.0 Basic net income per ADS vii 188.4 150.0 Diluted net income per ordinary share vii 93.8 74.6 Diluted net income per ADS vii 187.6 149.2 Explanation In s million reference 2005 2004 Equity shareholders funds under UK GAAP 121 118 US GAAP adjustments: Pensions i 355 343 Goodwill, less accumulated amortisation of 584 m 2004: 386 m ii 636 839 Brands trade marks licences, less accumulated amortisation of 361m 2004: 261m ii 2,645 2,762 Deferred taxation iii 884 932 Mark to market adjustments due to non designation of hedge accounting per SFAS 133 iv 72 37 Proposed dividend v 278 253 Employee share schemes vi 9 Shareholders funds under US GAAP 1,807 1,659 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 64 SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UK AND US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GAAP i Pensions Under UK GAAP, pension costs are accounted for under the rules set out in Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
Its objectives and principles are broadly in line with those set out in the US accounting standard for pensions, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
87, Employers Accounting for Pensions SFAS 87.
However, SSAP 24 is less prescriptive in the application of the actuarial method and assumptions to be applied in the calculation of pension costs.
Under US GAAP, the annual pension cost comprises the estimated cost of benefits accruing in the period as determined in accordance with SFAS 87.
Under SFAS 87, a pension asset representing the excess of Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund assets over benefit obligations has been recognised in the balance sheet.
ii Business combinations Both UK and US GAAP require purchase consideration relating to a business combination to be allocated to the net assets acquired at their fair value on the date of acquisition Intangible assets Under UK GAAP fair values are assigned to identifiable intangible assets only if the identifiable intangibles are capable of being disposed of or settled separately, without disposing of a business of the entity.
Under US GAAP, identifiable assets are separately valued and amortised over their useful lives.
The separately identifiable intangible assets included in the US GAAP balance sheet are principally comprised of brand rights, which are being amortised over periods between 25 to 30 years.
Goodwill amortisation Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising and separately identifiable and separable intangible assets acquired on acquisitions made on or after 27 September 1998 are capitalised and amortised over their useful life, not exceeding a period of 20 years.
Prior to 27 September 1998, all goodwill and separately identifiable and separable intangible assets were written off to reserves on acquisition.
The Company adopted SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142 with effect from 1 July 2001 and accordingly goodwill arising on acquisitions after this date are not amortised.
For purchase transactions prior to 1 July 2001, goodwill was capitalised and amortised over its useful life.
From 29 September 2002, in accordance with SFAS 142, the Company no longer amortises goodwill but rather tests such assets for impairment on an annual basis or where there is an indicator of impairment.
The Company completed an annual impairment review under SFAS 142 at 30 September 2005 and no impairment of goodwill was indicated.
For the purposes of the annual impairment review, goodwill has been allocated to the following reporting units of the Group: Manufacturing, UK Sales and Marketing and International Sales and Marketing.
iii Deferred taxation Under UK GAAP, deferred taxation is provided in full on all material timing differences.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 65 SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UK AND US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GAAP iv Derivative financial instruments The Group has entered into certain swap transactions with contractual maturities exceeding those of the underlying debt being hedged, in anticipation of there being additional floating rate debt when the existing debt matures.
The SAYE scheme is regarded as compensatory and the discount is accrued over the vesting period of the grant.
vii Net income per share Basic net income per ordinary share has been computed using US GAAP net income and weighted average ordinary shares.
Diluted net income per ordinary share has been calculated by taking into account the weighted average number of shares that would be issued on conversion into ordinary shares of options held under employee share schemes.
There would be no significant dilution of earnings if outstanding share options were exercised.
Each American Depositary Share ADS represents two Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares.
