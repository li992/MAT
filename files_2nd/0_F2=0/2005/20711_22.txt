fees, and costs directly attributable and incremental to setting up the loan, over the expected life of the mortgage.
Fee and commission income Fees and commissions are generally recognised on an accruals basis when the service has been provided.
Fees integral to the loan yield are included within interest income and expense as part of the effective interest rate calculation.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency monetary transactions are translated into sterling using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions, and are re-translated at year end exchange rates.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into, and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative.
Derivatives can be designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges.
Cash ow hedges A cash flow hedge is used to hedge exposures to variability in cash flows, such as variable rate financial assets and liabilities.
The effective portion of changes in the derivative fair value is recognised in equity, and recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
The fair value gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Fair value hedges A fair value hedge is used to hedge exposures to variability in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, such as fixed rate loans.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement.
The carrying value of the hedged item or in the case of a portfolio hedge, the separate caption fair value macro hedge is adjusted for the change in the fair value of the hedged risk.
Such changes in the fair value of the hedged item are also taken to the Income Statement.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity.
If derivatives are not designated as hedges then changes in fair values are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
The Group issues share options and other equity-settled payments to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value at date of grant using a binomial option pricing model.
The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest.

Assets and liabilities have been allocated to time bands by reference to the earlier of the next interest rate reset date and the contractual maturity date.
Financial assets and liabilities with a floating rate are exposed to cash flow interest rate risk, and this risk is reflected predominantly in the time bands below twelve months.
Financial assets and liabilities with a fixed rate are exposed to fair value interest rate risk, which is reflected predominantly in the time bands beyond twelve months.
Financial assets and liabilities not directly exposed to interest rate risk will appear in the non-interest bearing time band.
The table takes account of derivative financial interests whose effect is to alter the interest basis of Group assets and liabilities.
The trading book and non-interest bearing balances have been included in a separate column.
An interest rate repricing analysis for 31 December 2004 under UK GAAP is given in Note 51 on page 88. iii Trading book The following table sets out the change in the value of the trading book arising from a 1% change in market interest rates, for the year ended 31 December 2005 with all other variable remaining consistent.

Excludes 820.9m designated as at fair value through profit or loss 3.
Excludes 6,540.1m designated as at fair value through profit or loss Due to and from banks The fair value of floating rate and overnight deposits is approximately equal to their carrying amount.
The estimated fair value of fixed rate loans and deposits is based on discounted cash flows using prevailing money market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and remaining maturity.
Loans and advances to customers and due to customers Floating rate loans and advances and deposits are recorded in the balance sheet using the effective interest rate method, less provisions for impairment.
This value is considered to be a good approximation for fair value.
For fixed rate loans and advances and deposits the fair value is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows on the instruments at current market interest rates.
Net investment in finance leases and hire purchase contracts The fair value of floating rate assets is approximately equal to their carrying amount.
The estimated fair value of fixed rate assets is based on discounted cash flows using prevailing money market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and remaining maturity.
Investment securities, debt securities in issue, and other borrowed funds Fair values are based on quoted market prices.
For instruments where quoted market prices are not available, the market price is based on discounted cash flows using interest rates for securities with similar credit, maturity and yield characteristics.
The comparative figures at 31 December 2004 are prior to the adoption of IAS 32 and so do not fall within its disclosure requirements.
Fair values for financial assets and liabilities that were listed, publicly traded or for which a liquid and active market existed, are disclosed in Note 51 on page 87.
4 Critical accounting estimates Some asset and liability amounts reported in the accounts are based on management estimates and assumptions.
There is therefore a risk of significant changes to the carrying amounts for these assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Impairment provisions The level of potential credit losses is uncertain and depends on a number of factors such as unemployment levels, interest rates, house price levels and other general economic conditions.
The Group bases impairment provisions on estimates based on historical loss experience.
Actual cash flows on financial assets may differ from management estimates, resulting in an increase or decrease in impairment charges and provisions.
Effective interest rate calculations IAS 39 requires certain financial assets and liabilities to be held at amortised cost, with income recognised using the Effective Interest Rate EIR methodology.
In order to calculate EIR, it is necessary to estimate the level of repayments that will be made before the contractual due date.
For residential mortgages the estimated level and timing of redemptions is critical to the EIR calculation.
If customers leave earlier than anticipated, this will generally lead to a reduction in the balance sheet carrying value, and a corresponding charge to the income statement.
Retirement benefit obligations The income statement cost and balance sheet liability of the defined benefit pension scheme and post-retirement medical benefits are assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
Assumptions are made for inflation, the rate of increase in salaries and pensions, the rate used to discount scheme liabilities, the expected return on scheme assets and mortality rates.
Changes to any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on the balance sheet liabilities, and to a lesser extent the income statement costs.
5 Segmental reporting The business is comprised of three sectors: Retail Banking This comprises the Core 4 products of mortgages, personal loans, current accounts and savings and the Partner 4 products of credit cards, life assurance, general insurance and long term investments.
Wholesale Banking This comprises the four core business lines of money transmission, lending, business banking and treasury.
Group Items This includes corporate overheads, and capital not allocated to business units.
Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2005 59 Statutory Accounts Notes to the Accounts 5 Segmental reporting continued Transactions between the sectors are on normal commercial terms and conditions.
Internal charges and transfer pricing adjustments, based on the usage of central functions, have been reflected in the performance of each sector.
Capital is allocated to the business sectors on the basis of 6.5% equity tier 1, 0.75% non-equity tier 1 and 2.25% subordinated debt.
In 2004 capital was allocated on the basis of 7% equity tier 1 and 3.5% subordinated debt.
No geographical analysis is presented because substantially all of the Groups activities are in the UK.
A more detailed breakdown of sector results is given within the unaudited Financial Review on pages 18 to 26.

Some accounting volatility arises on these items due to accounting ineffectiveness on designated hedges, or because hedge accounting has not been adopted or is not achievable on certain items.
The loss is primarily due to timing differences in income recognition between the derivative instruments and the economically hedged assets and liabilities.

The underlying effective tax rate for 2005 was 26.5% 2004: 26.9%.
The calculation of the 2005 underlying effective tax rate excludes a tax credit of 0.3m in respect of the 1.0m fair value accounting volatility loss and takes into consideration, as part of underlying profits, the appropriation of profit of 17.5m in respect of non-equity tier 1.
The 2004 underlying effective tax rate excludes a charge of 17.3m in respect 62 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2005 of the 52.0m profit on disposal of operations sale of merchant acquiring business, shown in the income statement after operating profit and takes into consideration, as part of underlying profits, the coupon of 13.7m in respect of non-equity tier 1.
Further information about deferred tax is presented in Note 31 on page 72.
The Group expects to maintain an underlying effective tax rate below the statutory rate of corporation tax, but above that achieved in 2005, as it will continue to carry out its commercial activities and structure its business in a tax efficient manner.
The effective rate of tax for the year of 25.6% is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30%, where the Group generates substantially all its profits.

Contract amount indicates the amount of business outstanding at the balance sheet date and does not represent amounts at risk.
The replacement cost represents the cost of replacing contracts, calculated at market rates current at the balance sheet date, and reflects the Groups exposure should the counterparty default.
No account is taken of any offsetting position with the same counterparty.
The SPVs, owned by charitable trusts, are funded by Asset Backed Commercial Paper and invest in AAA rated assets.
In addition to these loans the Group provides liquidity facilities to the SPVs, amounting to 1,132m at 31 December 2005.
The SPVs are not consolidated into the Group accounts on the basis that the SPVs are not controlled by the Group and the benefits the Group receives from the SPVs are restricted to interest and fees relating directly to the loans and liquidity facilities provided.

The Fair Value Option is used by the Group where Treasury assets or liabilities would otherwise be measured at amortised cost, the associated derivatives used to economically hedge the risk are held at fair value, and it is not practical to apply hedge accounting.
The Group has also designated certain financial instruments containing embedded derivatives at fair value through profit or loss.
At 1 January 2005 assets of 466.1m and liabilities of 551.6m were designated at fair value through profit or loss.
The table below shows the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities that upon initial recognition, or at 1 January 2005 on the adoption of IAS 39, were designated at fair value through profit or loss, and the net gains or losses on these instruments.

New employees joining the Group on or after 1 April 1998 were eligible to join a defined contribution section of the Scheme.
The principal scheme is an exempt approved pension scheme under which retirement and death benefits are provided for Group employees.
The funds of the Scheme are administered by trustees independently of the finances of the participating employers.
In addition, benefits are provided by the Company on an unfunded unapproved basis to a number of senior staff recruited since June 1989 whose benefits would otherwise be restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.
The Group has adopted the revised IAS 19, published in December 2004.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in full, through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2005.

Alliance & Leicester plc is the sponsoring employer for the Scheme.
There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for recharging the defined benefit cost to other companies in the Group.
Therefore, in accordance with IAS 19, the Company recognises the whole defined benefit liability of the Scheme.

These are described below, with further details given in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 36 and 37. i ShareSave Scheme This Scheme is open to all employees.
Participants may elect to save up to 250 per month under a three or five year savings contract.
An option is granted by the Company to buy shares at a price based on 80% of the market value of the shares at the time of grant.
At the end of the savings contract, a tax free bonus is applied to the savings and the option becomes exercisable, for a period of six months.
Options are exercisable earlier if an employee leaves the Group in special circumstances.
ii Share Incentive Plan SIP free shares Eligible employees are awarded free shares each year, based on a percentage of their salary.
There are no performance criteria.
iii Share Incentive Plan partnership shares This Scheme is open to all employees.
Participants may elect to save up to 125 per month under a six month savings contract.
The savings are converted into shares, based on the lower price at the start and end of the six month period.
iv Executive and Senior Manager Share Options Executive Options are normally granted twice a year, after the final results and the interim results announcements.
The number of shares over which options are granted is based on a multiple of the participants salary.
The exercise of options is subject to a performance condition based on Earnings Per Share EPS growth.
For options granted in 2003-2005, the performance condition is that the percentage growth in EPS must exceed the percentage growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 9% over the specified three year period.
Options are exercisable for up to seven years from the vesting date.
v Executive Deferred Bonus Scheme For the 2003 and 2004 bonus schemes executive directors were required to defer 25% of their bonus into shares and were entitled to defer up to 100%.
The deferred bonus may be matched by the Company depending on the Companys relative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance over a three year period against a group of its retail banking peers, to a maximum of 300% of the deferred amount for upper quartile performance.
The rights to shares cannot normally be exercised for three years and lapse if not exercised within seven years.
Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2005 77 Statutory Accounts Notes to the Accounts 38 Share-based payments continued vi Executive Performance Share Plan For 2005 the Deferred Bonus Scheme was replaced with the Performance Share Plan for executive directors.
The annual award is normally shares to the value of 125% of salary.
The performance period is three years with no re-testing.
The vesting of 50% of the award depends on the performance of the Companys TSR relative to a peer group of retail banks.
The vesting of the other 50% of the award depends on the percentage growth in EPS, with vesting starting when adjusted EPS growth exceeds inflation by 3% per annum, and full vesting when adjusted EPS exceeds inflation by 8% per annum.
vii Senior Manager Deferred Bonus Scheme Senior Managers can defer up to 25% of their annual bonus into shares.
The amount of shares to be received are based on double the amount of bonus deferred, based on the market value of the Companys shares at the time.
This amount is then matched on a one for one basis.
The vesting of the options, normally three years later, is not subject to performance conditions.

46,204 SIP partnership shares were issued in January 2004 at a price of 830p per share and 57,074 shares in July 2004 at a price of 815p per share.
The fair value of these awards was between 26p and 52p per share.
The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a binomial option pricing model.

For clarity, the reclassifications are shown in a separate column to the other IFRS impacts which increase or decrease net assets.
ii IFRS requires the consolidation of mortgage securitisation vehicles, compared to linked presentation under UK GAAP.
This results in the inclusion of securitised advances in Loans and advances to customers, comprising most of the increase to that category.
Non-recourse finance, shown as a deduction from Loans and advances to customers under UK GAAP, is included in Debt securities in issue under IFRS and comprises the vast majority of the adjustment to that category.
Due from other banks increases due to the consolidation of bank deposits in the securitisation vehicle.
Due to customers decreases as loans made by the securitisation vehicle to the Group are now eliminated on consolidation.
iii IAS 17 requires the use of the pre-tax actuarial method of income recognition compared to the post-tax basis in UK GAAP.
IAS 17 results in interest being recognised later than under UK GAAP.
Consequently there is a reduction in the carrying value of Net investment in finance leases and hire purchase contracts on first-time IFRS adoption.
iv IAS 16 and IAS 17 requires the use of straight line depreciation, compared to an annuity basis in UK GAAP.
Depreciation is recognised earlier under IFRS, reducing the carrying value of Operating lease assets.
v Under UK GAAP, there is a SSAP 24 prepayment in relation to the defined benefit pension scheme.
Under IAS 19 the basis of accounting for pension schemes is fundamentally different, and the prepayment is no longer applicable.
vi IAS 10 requires that dividends are not accrued until they are approved.
The reduction in Other liabilities is mainly due to not accruing the final dividend, which was only approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2004. vii The reduction in Deferred tax liabilities reflects the tax impacts arising from changes to assets and liabilities on adopting IFRS for the first time.
viii IAS 19 requires that retirement benefit obligations in the defined benefit pension Scheme are included in the Group balance sheet.
The Group has elected to recognise actuarial gains and losses in full immediately as permitted by the revision to IAS 19 published in December 2004.
The increase of 186.6m reflects the difference between the Scheme assets on a bid price basis and the Scheme liabilities at 1 January 2004. ix IFRS 2 requires that the fair value of share option awards is expensed to the income statement, with a corresponding amount recorded in the Reserve for share-based payments.
x On first-time IFRS adoption, all movements in equity from UK GAAP to IFRS are posted directly to Profit and loss account reserves.
The reduction of 131.1m reflects the sum of the impacts to assets and liabilities at 1 January 2004.

b the reclassification of non-equity tier 1 from liabilities to minority interests, and the reversal of a 2.3m fair value hedging adjustment on the instrument.
c the re-recognition of all financial liabilities at their full contractual amount.
Previously the Group utilised the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 that only required financial liabilities fide-recognised after 1 January 2004 to be re-recognised.
The impact of this is to increase liabilities at 1 January 2005 by 40.7m, which after tax reduces net assets by 28.5m.
Notes i IAS 32 and IAS 39 result in a number of reclassifications between balance sheet categories.
For clarity, the reclassifications are shown in a separate column to the other IAS 32 and IAS 39 impacts which increase or decrease net assets.
ii IAS 39 requires that all derivatives are measured at fair value on the balance sheet, compared to cost under UK GAAP.
iii The EIR rules in IAS 39 require that discounts and incentives, and most fees and commissions receivable and payable, are spread over the average life of the loan.
Under UK GAAP, the Groups policy was to take these items to profit or loss as incurred, except for mortgage products where the customer had an obligation over a period of time to return the incentive if they redeemed the mortgage, and the early redemption fee was closely linked to the incentive cost.
The impact of the EIR rules is an increase in Loans and advances to customers of 142m.
There is a further increase of 21m, resulting from a reduction in impairment provisions under IAS 39, which require more observable evidence of impairment before a provision is made.
iv Debt securities have been reclassified to Investment Securities, split between Available-for-sale, Held-to-maturity, Loans and receivables and At fair value through profit or loss, and Trading securities.
v IAS 39 requires that Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value on the balance sheet, compared to cost under UK GAAP.
vi Held-to-maturity and Loans and receivables are accounted for under the IAS 39 EIR rules.
vii Certain investment securities have been designated by the Group as At fair value through profit or loss.
These securities are shown at fair value on the balance sheet, with subsequent changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
viii IAS 39 permits macro-hedging of financial assets and liabilities.
The resulting fair value adjustment to the underlying assets and liabilities is not allocated to individual assets and liabilities.
ix Under UK GAAP 23.3m of deferred mortgage incentives were included in prepayments and accrued income.
These are eliminated under IAS 39 as these incentives are accounted for as part of the EIR rules.
x The increase in amounts due to customers results from the requirement in IAS 39 to record financial liabilities at their contractual value.
xi Some debt securities in issue are fair value hedged, as permitted by IAS 39 and the Group has elected to designate some debt securities at fair value through profit or loss.
The movement reflects fair value adjustments.
xii Under UK GAAP income was being deferred on a swap transaction.
Under IFRS the income is recognised earlier and not deferred.
xiii The increase in Deferred tax liabilities reflects the tax impacts arising from changes to assets and liabilities on adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 for the first time.
xiv The movement in Other borrowed funds reflects the retranslation of foreign currency subordinated loans and fair value hedging adjustments.
xv In accordance with IAS 32, this instrument has been reclassified within Minority interests.
xvi In accordance with IAS 32, this instrument has been reclassified to Debt securities in issue.
xvii On adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, all movements in equity are posted directly to reserves.
The increase of 76.0m reflects the sum of the impacts to assets and liabilities at 1 January 2005.

This changes the income recognition profile on finance lease assets, and the funding cost profile on finance lease liabilities.

iii IAS 10 requires that dividends are not accrued until they are approved.
The reduction in Other assets is mainly due to not having a dividend debtor for dividends due from Group undertakings.
iv Under IAS 17 land leases are now normally treated as operating lease assets.
The reduction in Other liabilities is mainly due to not accruing the final dividend, which was only approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2004. vii The increase in Deferred tax assets reflects the tax impacts arising from changes to assets and liabilities on adopting IFRS for the first time.
viii IAS 19 requires that retirement benefit obligations in the defined benefit pension scheme are included in the Company balance sheet.
The Company has elected to recognise actuarial gains and losses in full immediately as permitted by the revision to IAS 19 published in December 2004.
The increase of 186.6m reflects the difference between the scheme assets on a bid price basis and the scheme liabilities at 1 January 2004. ix IFRS 2 requires that the fair value of share option awards is expensed to the income statement, with a corresponding amount recorded in the Reserve for share-based payments.
The reduction of 161.2m reflects the sum of the impacts to assets and liabilities at 1 January 2004.
