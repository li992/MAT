Explanation of transition to IFRS This is the first year that the company has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The following disclosures are required in the year of transition.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued a Reconciliation of equity at 1 January 2004 date of transition to IFRS continued The US GAAP figures as at 1 January 2004 have been restated to reflect an adjustment to goodwill of $130,000 in respect of a 2003 acquisition.
In addition, a reclassification of $1,186,000 has been made between share premium and translation reserves to reflect the appropriate treatment of foreign exchange translation of share capital.
Under US GAAP, FAS 86, internally generated intangible assets were capitalised during the year ended 31 December 2004.
This included general overheads which are not allowed under IFRS, while FAS 86 leaves the capitalization of these costs up to professional judgement.
As a result the amount capitalised was reduced by $509,000 and charged in the income statement.
Under IFRS a deferred tax asset is computed based on the applicable tax deductions for the tax benefits related to share based payments as of the end of each period for outstanding share options.
The adjustment of $1,731,000 relates to the tax benefits related to share based payments as of 31 December 2003 and 2004.
Under IFRS, invoiced amounts in respect of contractual arrangements for future support and maintenance arrangements are recognized as deferred revenue with a corresponding asset until the point in the future at which the relevant service is delivered.
The differences to do not affect the income statement.
During the years ended 31 December 2003 and 2004 the company repurchased its own shares, which were subsequently cancelled.
Under US GAAP, these amounts were debited to common stock, issued capital APIC and retained earnings, as prescribed within the guidance.
Under IFRS these amounts are required to be debited entirely to Retained Earnings.
Under IFRS 2, Share Based Compensation, a share based compensation charge is recorded in relation to share option grants based on the fair value of the grant at the time of the award.

Explanation of transition to IFRS continued c Notes to the reconciliation of equity at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 continued The corresponding entries in relation to each of the above entries is processed through retained earnings.
Under IFRS stock compensation charges are required to be recognised for all share options granted based on the fair value of the options on date of grant.
The US GAAP charge related to options issued at below market value which are required to be expensed.
All other options were issued at market value and were therefore captured within the FAS 123 disclosures rather than expensed.
This adjustment eliminates the US GAAP charge and processes the charge of $512,000 under IFRS 2.
In addition, this is allocated to each functional area as required under IAS 1.
Both of the above adjustments have been tax affected.
f Explanation of material adjustments to the cash flow statement for 2004 There are no material adjustments to the cash flow.
The only differences between US GAAP and IFRS in respect of cash flow relate to presentational changes.
