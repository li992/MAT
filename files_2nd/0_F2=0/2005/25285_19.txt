3 Analysis of profit before tax continued Restatement of prior year As a result of the increasing prominence of rolled-up interest in mezzanine, the directors believe that it is now appropriate to modify the accounting presentation of the amount payable under the Medium Term Incentive Scheme with respect to rolled-up interest.
It is now shown in full separately under administrative expenses in the profit and loss account and creditors in the balance sheet, whereas previously, it was shown as a reduction to interest income and investments.
As a result, both interest income and administrative expenses have increased by 2.7m for the year ending 31 January 2004 and 1.1m for the year ending 31 January 2005.
Investments and creditors have both increased by 8.4m at 31 January 2004 and 9.5m for the year ending 31 January 2005.
Core income, profit before tax and net assets are unaffected in all periods.
