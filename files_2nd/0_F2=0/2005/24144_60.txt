Staff pension schemes a Introduction The Group operates several defined benefit schemes: the Friends Provident Pension Scheme FPPS, to which the majority of the Group's UK Life & Pensions employees belong, and various schemes operated by F&C.
In addition, the Group operates two defined contribution schemes: the scheme operated by F&C and the scheme operated by FPI.
Lombard does not operate a pension scheme.
b Total schemes Under IAS 19 Employee Benefits, the pension liability is recognised in provisions in the balance sheet and has been grossed up for deferred tax.
The market value of the schemes assets exclude units held in internal linked funds classified as non-transferable assets.
This presentation has no impact on shareholders' equity as the internal investment contract liability is also excluded.
However, non-transferable assets are taken into account in determining the pension liability in the actuarial valuation.
A reconciliation of the Group pension liability included in the consolidated balance sheet and the net pension liability as determined by actuarial valuations is set out below.

Staff pension schemes continued ii Mortality assumptions To recognise the increasing longevity of pensioners, the mortality assumption basis was changed to the medium cohort basis for 2005.
'Medium' relates to three scenario tables produced by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau of the Institute of Actuaries to reflect the uncertainty of future longevity experience of annuitants: 'short', 'medium', and 'long', which vary based on how long the improvements in mortality are projected to last.
'Cohort' refers to the idea suggested by some surveys that mortality varies by year of birth.
With respect to FPPS the mortality assumptions are projected forward, to take account of future improvements in mortality, according to each individual's year of birth.
For 2004, the PM FA92 tables were used for mortality assumptions.
The tables, published in 1999, are based on investigations carried out between 1991 and 1994.
With respect to FPPS these are projected forward, to take account of future improvements in mortality to 2040 for all future pensioners and 2010 for all current pensioners.
For future pensioners the projections are rated down one year.
The cost of strengthening mortality assumptions in 2005 to the medium cohort basis was 35m.
The mortality assumptions provide the following life expectancies of members retiring at the age of 60: Life expectancy 2005 2004 Basis - future pensioners PM FA92BMC PM FA92C2040-1 Basis - current pensioners PM FA92BMC PM FA92C2010 Expected age at death of future male pensioner 88 87 Expected age at death of future female pensioner 90 90 Expected age at death of current male pensioner 87 84 Expected age at death of current female pensioner 90 87 projected according to individuals year of birth The present value of providing an annuity from the age of 60, based on the above life expectancies, for every one pound of pension accumulated, is as follows: Cost of annuities 2005 2004 Male annuity 22.72 22.30 Female annuity 22.29 21.90 These rates assume a monthly payments model with a discount rate of 4.75% 2004: 5.50%.
The rates also assume 2 3rds of the members benefit will be paid to the spouse a 5-year guarantee is provided and pensions in excess of GMP will increase by 2.70% per annum.

FPPS has three derivative contracts with Merrill Lynch - two inflation swaps and one interest rate floor.
Inflation swaps were set up in order to hedge against reductions in real yields interest rates minus inflation.
In addition, an interest rate floor hedges against the risk of interest rates falling to significantly low levels.
The inflation swaps are 30 year contracts and increase in value by approximately 1.4m for every basis point 0.01% reduction in real yields.
Over the course of 2005, real yields fell by 0.6% with the 30 year swap rate at 31 December 2005 being 4.2% 2004: 4.7% and the corresponding inflation rate being 3.1% 2004: 3.0%.
At 31 December 2005, the swaps were valued at 136m 2004: 56m.
The interest rate floor increases in value as interest rates fall and as implied interest rate volatility rises.
Over 2005, the interest rates fell along with an approximate fall in implied volatility of 1%.
At 31 December 2005, the floor was valued at 17m 2004: 15m.
For the purposes of collateral management, the instruments are valued weekly using market data and pricing models which are also independently verified.
At 31 December 2005, the total collateral held was 136m which consisted of four holdings of UK Treasury and Index-linked stock 2004: 70m consisting of two holdings of UK Treasury and Index-linked stock.

d F&C Asset Management plc pension schemes F&C operates two core defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and one in Portugal.
Both of the UK schemes are closed to new entrants with all new UK employees eligible to benefit from defined contribution arrangements.
The Chairman of F&C, Mr RW Jenkins, was awarded pension benefits by F&C Management Limited prior to completion of the merger of ISIS and F&C in respect of his past service to F&C.
This is an unfunded pensions liability and therefore the Group has made an appropriate provision in its accounts.
Employees of F&C in The Netherlands and Ireland participate in multi-employer pension arrangements.
The Netherlands scheme is open to new employees.
Plans are currently ongoing to set up separate defined benefit pension schemes in respect of employees in The Netherlands and Ireland.
These new arrangements will maintain the existing benefits of current employees and will be funded by the transfer of assets from the current multi-employer schemes.
Where F&C is unable to separately identify its share of assets and liabilities of overseas multiemployer defined benefit schemes, these schemes are accounted for as defined contribution arrangements.
The details of the individual schemes in summary are as follows: F&C Netherlands BV Employees in The Netherlands participate in the Achmea Pension Plan.
F&C Netherlands BV contributed 930,000 639,000 to the Achmea Pension Plan for the year.
F&C Ireland Limited Certain staff in Ireland participate in the Friends First Retirement and Death Benefits Plan.
F&C Ireland Limited contributed 101,000 69,000 to the Friends First Retirement and Death Benefits Plan for the year.

Staff pension schemes continued ii Mortality assumptions Similarly to FPPS, the mortality assumption basis for the F&C schemes has changed to the medium cohort basis for 2005.
Unlike FPPS, the mortality assumptions have been projected forward, to take account of future improvements in mortality, using a 'typical' year of birth of 1965 for all future pensioners and 1935 for all current pensioners, rather than on an individual basis.
For 2004, the PM FA92 tables were used for mortality assumptions with no projection forward for future improvements in mortality and rated down by 3 years for future pensioners.
The cost of strengthening the mortality in 2005 was 18m.
The mortality assumptions provide the following life expectancies of members retiring at the age of 60: Life expectancy 2005 2004 Basis - future pensioners PM FA92B1965MC-1 PM FA92base-3 Basis - current pensioners PM FA92B1935MC-1 PM FA92base Expected age at death of future male pensioner 88 84 Expected age at death of future female pensioner 91 87 Expected age at death of current male pensioner 86 81 Expected age at death of current female pensioner 89 84 The present value of providing an annuity from the age of 60, based on the above life expectancies, for every one pound of pension accumulated, is as follows: 2005 2004 Cost of annuities Male annuity 24.70 20.40 Female annuity 25.20 20.90 These rates assume a monthly payments model with a discount rate of 4.70% 2004: 5.30% based on the iBoxx over 15 year AA corporate bond index of 4.73% 2004: 5.29%.
The rates also assume 2 3rds of the members benefit will be paid to the spouse, a 5-year guarantee is provided and pensions in excess of GMP will increase by 2.75% per annum.
