Presentation of Income Statement The implementation of FRS 21 and the 2005 SORP has resulted in changes in the presentation of total returns.
Previously dividends paid and payable in respect of a year were disclosed on the face of the Statement of Total Return and the revenue column of that statement was deemed to be the profit and loss account of the Company.
We now present an Income Statement which does not show on its face the distribution in respect of equity shares and whilst it still shows information on capital and revenue returns it is the total return column which is regarded as the profit and loss account of the company.
