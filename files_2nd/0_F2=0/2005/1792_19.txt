Pro forma financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 based on unaudited gures As permitted by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of IFRS, the Group has elected to adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial Instruments prospectively from 1 January 2005, and comparative gures have not been restated.
These standards have a significant impact on the Group and particularly affect the accounting for the Companys convertible redeemable preference shares, the hedging activities of the Group and those of the PFI PPP concessions, and the assets and income of the PFI PPP concessions.
Pro forma IFRS financial statements, which include the impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39 as if the Group had adopted them for the year ended 31 December 2004, are included below with the IFRS financial statements for 2005.
These pro forma statements assume the full adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, and the application of hedge accounting where management believes it is appropriate to assume the relevant accounting criteria regarding documentation and effectiveness could have been met.
The changes which the adoption of IAS 39 and the IFRIC draft interpretations in respect of PFI PPP concessions would have made on the restated IFRS profit for the year and net assets if these standards had been adopted for the year ended 31 December 2004 are summarised below.
