Assumptions The economic assumptions are based upon a long-term view of economic activity in South Africa and are therefore not adjusted for market movements which are considered to be short term.
This approach is considered to be the most appropriate given the long-term nature of the portfolio of products and that the business is located in South Africa.
The economic assumptions are derived by adding appropriate long term risk equity margins to the benchmark gilt i. e. R153 South African government bond.
The principal economic assumptions which have been used are as follows: %% Risk-adjusted discount rate 11.3 12.8 Return on equities gross of tax 10.3 11.8 Return on fixed interest securities gross of tax 8.3 9.8 Return on property investments gross of tax 9.3 10.8 Return on cash held gross of tax 6.3 7.8 Inflation rate 5.3 6.8 Balance sheet The assets of the long-term assurance fund attributable to the shareholder are detailed below: 000 000 Investments 270 777 326 264 Intercompany loans due 21 621 27 842 Other assets 39 349 61 207 Assets of the long-term assurance fund attributable to the shareholder 331 747 415 313 Current liabilities 74 128 71 723 257 619 343 590 Investments shown above comprise: Interest bearing securities 14 818 40 118 Stocks, shares, and unit trusts 93 020 94 448 Investment properties 115 449 76 484 Associate - 58 832 Deposits 47 490 56 382 270 777 326 264
