DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Employee Benefit Trust The Imperial Tobacco Group Employee and Executive Benefit Trust the Executive Trust and the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2001 Employee Benefit Trust the 2001 Trust have been established to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company, by subscription or purchase, from funds provided by the Group to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise of share options and on the vesting of the SMS and LTIP awards.
As potential beneficiaries of the Executive Trust, each of the Executive Directors is deemed to have a contingent interest in the 929,837 Ordinary Shares of the Company held by that Trust at 30 September 2005.
Details of the shareholdings by the Employee Benefit Trusts are as follows: Balance Purchased Distributed Balance Shares under at during during at Award at Surplus 1 1 10 2004 year year 30 9 2005 30 9 2005 Shortfall Executive Trust 828,432 353,073 251,668 929,837 876,241 53,596 2001 Trust 3,235,921 359,727 1,498,948 2,096,700 5,258,773 3,162,073 1 As at 30 September 2005, the Company also held 13,515,000 shares in Treasury which could be used to satisfy awards under the share plans.
Share Plan Flow Rates The Companys policy has always been to satisfy all awards under its share schemes from market purchased shares through the Trusts.
The Trust Deeds and the Rules of all schemes contain provisions limiting awards to five per cent in five years and 10 per cent in 10 years for all employee schemes with an additional restriction to five per cent in 10 years for executive schemes.
Currently an aggregate total of only 0.9 per cent of the Companys issued share capital is subject to awards under all the Groups executive and all employee share schemes.
In future the Trust may also be provided with shares held by the Company in Treasury in order to satisfy vesting awards.
Since demerger in 1996 the cumulative awards under all of the Companys share plans totals under 2.7 per cent of its issued share capital.
Following initial grants on demerger, subsequent annual grants have averaged 0.3 per cent of issued share capital.
Executive Directors Pensions The Executive Directors are all members of the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund, the principal defined benefit scheme operated by the Group.
For members who joined prior to 1 April 2002 the fund is non-contributory with a normal retirement age of 60.
The fund allows members to achieve the maximum pension of two-thirds of their salary at normal retirement age after 32 years service.
Pension commutation to enable participants to receive a lump sum on retirement is permitted within Inland Revenue limits.
For death before retirement, a capital sum equal to four times salary is payable together with a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members expected pension at retirement.
For death in retirement, a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members pre-commutation pension is payable.
Dependant children will also receive allowances.
Pensions increase by the lesser of 10 per cent and the increase in Retail Price Index, together with an option under the rules to surrender part of a pension for pension increases in line with the general index of retail prices of up to 15 per cent.
All Executive Directors earn benefits on the standard scale with a normal retirement age of 60.
The Remuneration Committee is reviewing its policy for current Executive Directors pensions in light of proposed UK legislation due to be published in November 2005.
Once this legislation has been finalised the Remuneration Committee intends to conclude its review.
Simultaneously the Remuneration Committee will be reviewing its policy for future Executive Directors in light of the final legislation, market competitiveness and its overall remuneration policy.
The following table provides the information required by both the Listing Rules and schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and gives details for each Director of: the annual accrued pension payable from normal retirement age, calculated as if he had left service at the year end: the increase in accrued pension during the year, excluding any increases for inflation in respect of the disclosure required under the Listing Rules: and the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension calculated in accordance with the actuarial guidance note GN11.
None of the Directors has made additional voluntary contributions.

3 Restated to reflect recalculation of transfer values at 1 October 2004.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual Director.
Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
Benefits The principal taxable benefits for Executive Directors are the provision of cars and health insurance.
Remuneration from other Non-Executive Directorships The Company recognises that external non-executive directorships are beneficial for both the Executive Director concerned and the Company.
Executive Directors are permitted, at the discretion of the Board, to retain fees received in respect of any such non-executive directorship.
Each serving Executive Director is restricted to one external non-executive directorship and may not serve as chairman of a FTSE 100 company.
Mr G Davis serves on the Board of Wolseley PLC and currently receives fees of 58,000 per annum.
Executive Directors Service Agreements It is the Groups policy to appoint Executive Directors under service agreements terminable by either party giving 52 weeks notice, as shown in the table below.
The service agreement of Mr G L Blashill, who was appointed to the Board on 28 October 2005, is terminable by either party giving a maximum of 52 weeks notice.
There are no predetermined provisions for compensation on termination within Executive Directors service agreements.
However, the Group is unequivocally against rewards for failure.
The circumstances of the termination and an individuals duty and opportunity to mitigate loss are taken into account in every case.
The Groups policy is to stop or reduce compensatory payments to former Directors to the extent that they receive remuneration from other employment during the compensation period.
Under the rules of the LTIP and SMS, outstanding awards vest on termination for certain reasons, such as death, retirement, redundancy or on a change of control, on a time-related pro-rata basis subject to satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria.
If, however, the termination of employment is for a reason other than one of those specified in the rules an individuals full award lapses.

Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors Fees for Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole with regard to market practice and within the restrictions contained in the Companys Articles of Association.
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The Non-Executive Directors do not take part in discussions on their own remuneration.
They receive no other material pay or benefits with the exception of reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with their directorship of the Company and provision of administrative support including the use of Company offices by the Chairman Mr D C Bonham and Joint Vice Chairman Mr A G L Alexander, do not participate in the Companys share schemes, bonus schemes or incentive plans and are not eligible for pension scheme membership.
To align further the interest of the Non-Executive Directors with those of shareholders, it was agreed that a proportion of their fees be applied, after tax, to purchase shares in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC.
These shares are to be held by a nominee during the term of each Non-Executive Directorship.
Exceptionally in respect of Mr D C Bonham and Mr A G L Alexander, this requirement has been waived due to their continued level of investment, as detailed above.
Furthermore given the impending retirement, at the forthcoming AGM, of Messrs S P Duffy and S Huismans this requirement has also been waived in respect of their emoluments paid during the financial year commencing 1 October 2005.
Mr S Huismans is also a member of Supervisory Boards within the Reemtsma Group for which he received additional remuneration for fulfilling such non-executive roles.
Non-Executive Directors Letters of Appointment The Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements with the Company.
The terms of their appointments are reviewed annually and upon them reaching 65 years of age.
These terms were reviewed for all Non-Executive Directors and confirmed on 1 February 2005.
The letters of appointment are available for viewing at the Companys registered office during normal business hours and prior to and at the AGM.
Under the terms of the Articles of Association of the Company, Non-Executive Directors stand for reappointment at the first Annual General Meeting following appointment, are subject to triennial reappointment by shareholders and retire subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 at the Annual General Meeting following their reaching 70 years of age.
There are no provisions in their letters of appointment regarding notice periods or compensation on early termination.
The letters of appointment detail the time commitment expected of each Non-Executive Director.
Although there is no current maximum term of appointment for Non-Executive Directors, the Board is supportive of the best practice provisions contained in the Code.
Messrs S P Duffy and S Huismans will be retiring from the Board at the AGM in February 2006, having both been on the Board since demerger in August 1996.
However where the Board considers a Non-Executive Director is making a particularly valuable contribution they may be invited to remain on the Board in excess of nine years.
In such instances the length of tenure of the Non-Executive Director would be relevant to the Companys deliberations as to the independence of the Non-Executive Director and he she would also be subject to annual reelection at the AGM.
Such re-elections will be subject to the overall independence of the Board not being compromised.
It is proposed that Messrs D C Bonham and A G L Alexander, who have also been on the Board since demerger in August 1996, will continue to serve on the Board and will therefore offer themselves for re-election annually.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 63 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Remuneration Arrangements for Former Directors Mr S T Painter Following his retirement in May 2000, Mr S T Painter entered into a consultancy agreement with Imperial Tobacco Limited, the Groups principal operating company.
The agreement, as amended in October 2001 and May 2004, runs to March 2007.
Under the terms of the agreement he provides consultancy services as required and receives fees at a day rate of 1,000 with a minimum fee based on 100 days service for each 12 month period ending on 30 June, and 67 days for the period 1 July 2006 to 6 March 2007.
The agreement is terminable by either party giving 12 months notice.
He is also entitled to reimbursement for the use of his car.
Mr Painter is also a member of Supervisory Boards within the Reemtsma Group for which he receives additional remuneration, for fulfilling such non-executive roles.
Mr M A Hussler In respect of Mr M A Hussler, subsequent to his resignation as a Director of the Company with effect from 9 July 2003, he remained as an employee receiving his full contractual remuneration until his resignation from the Company on 30 April 2005.
His base salary included the payment of a pension allowance of 5,980 which was neither eligible for bonus nor share schemes and was not pensionable.
Mr Hussler is currently in receipt of an annual retirement pension, that has been reduced because it has been taken before he reached his normal retirement age.
His service agreement with the Group provided that he would receive similar overall pension benefits to those that he would have received had he remained in the Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH pension arrangement.
This was, broadly, a pension for life equivalent to 42 per cent of his fixed annual salary at age 63.
For death in retirement, a spouses pension for life of 60 per cent of that amount would be payable.
The pension is made up of three parts: one part of the pension is payable from the unfunded pension arrangement of Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, another part is payable from the separately funded Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund and the difference, which is not separately pre-funded, is paid by the Company.
The pension payable under the Reemtsma arrangement and from the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund may be increased annually in accordance with the rules of those arrangements or as is required by law.
Mr B C Davidson In respect of Mr B C Davidson, subsequent to his resignation as a Director of the Company on 9 February 2005, he remained an employee receiving his full contractual remuneration until he left the Company on 30 April 2005.

The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, are set out below.
Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts incorporate the audited accounts of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC and its subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiary undertakings are all entities over which the Group has the power to control the entitys financial and operating policies.
There are no unconsolidated subsidiary undertakings.
The results of businesses are included from the effective date of acquisition and businesses sold are included up to the date of disposal.
The principal operating subsidiary undertakings are listed on pages 110 and 111.
US filing and corresponding amounts The financial statements incorporate additional financial information which will be incorporated in the Companys US Form 20-F filing requirements.
The information disclosed in these financial statements includes three year profit and loss account and cash flow statement information.
Intangible fixed assets goodwill Businesses acquired have been dealt with in the consolidated accounts using acquisition accounting.
Upon the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired that reflect the condition at the date of acquisition and any required adjustments made to bring the accounting policies of the businesses acquired into alignment with those of the Group.
Where the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is treated as goodwill.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made on or after 27 September 1998 is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, a period not exceeding 20 years.
Previously all goodwill was written off against reserves in the period of acquisition.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a previously acquired business, the profit or loss on disposal is determined after including the attributable amount of purchased goodwill previously written off to reserves.
Intangible fixed assets trade marks and licences Trade marks and licences are included at cost and amortised in annual equal instalments over a period which does not exceed 20 years.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are shown at cost less depreciation.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Depreciation of other fixed assets is calculated to write off their cost less residual values over their expected useful lives as follows: Freehold and leasehold buildings up to 50 years straight line Plant and equipment 2 to 20 years straight line reducing balance Fixtures and motor vehicles 2 to 14 years straight line Impairment of fixed assets Fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is based on the present value of the future cash flows relating to the asset.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows income generating units.
Impairment losses relating to tangible fixed assets are reversed where the recoverable amount increases because of a change in economic conditions or in the expected use of the asset.
Impairment losses in respect of intangible fixed assets are reversed where subsequent external events clearly and demonstrably reverse the effects of the event giving rise to the impairment in a way that was not foreseen in the original impairment calculation or where the intangible asset has a readily ascertainable market value and the market value has increased to an amount higher than the impaired carrying value.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
Cost includes all direct expenditure and an allocation of production overheads based on the normal level of activity.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 69 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided in full on all material timing differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more likely than not.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have not been discounted.
Turnover Turnover represents the amount charged to customers in respect of goods sold, services supplied and licence fees, exclusive of applicable sales taxes or equivalents, but inclusive of excise duty.
Sales of goods are recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer and when collectibility of the related receivables is reasonably assured.
Sales of services which includes fees for distributing third party products are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered.
Licence fees are recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreements.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction, or where forward foreign exchange contracts have been arranged, at the contracted rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, where a contracted rate does not apply, are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date and any exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
The profit and loss accounts of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange ruling during the year.
The balance sheets of the overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Differences between the profit and loss accounts translated at average rates and at balance sheet rates are shown as a movement in reserves and in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The Groups significant overseas equity investments are hedged by borrowings in the currencies in which those assets are denominated.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of the overseas net investments, including goodwill, less exchange differences on the borrowings, to the extent that they finance those investments, are taken to reserves through the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Other exchange gains and losses are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Interest Interest payable and receivable is recognised in the profit and loss account on an accruals basis.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure of foreign exchange and interest rate risks and are not used for trading purposes.
Instruments qualify for hedge accounting where the underlying asset or liability has characteristics which can be directly related to the instrument transacted.
Interest differentials arising under interest rate swaps are taken to the profit and loss account on an accruals basis and included within interest payable or receivable.
Any premiums or discounts received or paid are amortised over the lives of the instruments.
The principal amounts due to be exchanged at maturity under cross currency swaps are revalued at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date and included within borrowings.
Where forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge future transactions, gains and losses are not recognised until the transactions occur.
The Group excludes all short-term debtors and creditors from its derivatives and financial instrument disclosures, other than those on currency risks relating to monetary assets and liabilities.
Pension costs The cost of providing pensions is charged to the profit and loss account over employees service lives.

Such tax would become payable only if the assets were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
The total amount unprovided is 6m and it is not envisaged that this tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, as no dividends have been declared.
The Group currently has no plans to remit dividends which would result in a material tax effect.

It does not operate as a profit centre, nor does it enter into speculative transactions, and is subject to policies and procedures approved by the Board.
On a frequent basis, the Group Treasurer discusses matters with a treasury subcommittee, consisting of senior executives, including the Finance Director and Director of Finance and Planning.
The Group Treasurer reports on a regular basis to the Board, including provision of monthly treasury summaries and an annual review of strategy.
The following table analyses the Groups financial liabilities at the balance sheet date: In s million 2005 2004 Amounts falling due within one year Bank loans and overdrafts 25 97 Other loans 682 622 707 719 Amounts falling due after more than one year Bank loans between one and two years 110 Other loans between one and two years 1,021 686 Bank loans between two and five years 867 436 Other loans between two and five years 369 1,397 Other loans after five years 575 579 2,832 3,208 Total borrowings 3,539 3,927 The Group has loans amounting to 1m 2004: 8m which are secured by charges, mortgages or liens on certain fixed assets.
The loans maturing after five years are the 200m sterling bond which matures in December 2018, and the 350m sterling bond which matures in June 2012. i Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its borrowings and surplus cash.
In order to manage interest rate risk, the Group maintains both fixed and floating rate debt and uses derivatives, including interest rate and cross-currency swaps, to vary the mix.
The following table analyses the currency and interest composition of the Groups financial liabilities at the balance sheet date.

The majority of bank borrowings bear interest at rates fixed in advance for periods of one month by reference to LIBOR in the case of sterling and three months in the case of Australian dollar borrowings and EURIBOR in the case of euro borrowings.
The capital market issuance in place at the year end bears interest post-interest and currency swaps at rates fixed in advance for six months by reference to LIBOR in the case of the US dollar bond and for three months by reference to EURIBOR in the case of the sterling and euro bonds.
The figures shown in the tables above take into account various interest rate and currency swaps.
Hence the US dollar denominated bond issued in 1999 is shown within the sterling balance, and the sterling bonds issued in 2002 and 2003 are shown in the euro balance.
The fixed rate financial liabilities do not take into account forward start swaps, which may become effective after the balance sheet date.
ii Currency risk disclosure The Group is exposed to the translation of the results of overseas subsidiaries into sterling, as well as the impact of transactions in foreign currencies.
On significant acquisitions of overseas companies, borrowings are raised in the local currency to minimise the translation risk.
For transaction risk, where necessary, forward foreign exchange deals are entered into to hedge a proportion of the forecast foreign currency cash flows.
At the year end, 36.1m notional of forward foreign exchange deals were outstanding 2004: 33.0m.

Share Matching Scheme The Share Matching Scheme is designed to encourage employees to acquire and retain Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares.
There was an initiative in 2002 to mark the centenary of the founding of The Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland Limited.
All employees of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries employed on 10 December 2001, the date of the centenary, were invited to purchase up to 3,000 worth of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares and lodge them with the Employee Benefit Trusts.
Provided these shares are left in the Trusts, the lodged shares will be matched on a sliding scale from 20% for one years retention to a maximum of 100% if they are retained for five years.
For Executive Directors and most of the Groups management, individuals may elect to invest any proportion up to a maximum of 100% of their gross bonus in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares to be held by the Employee Benefit Trusts.
Provided that the shares elected for are left in the Trusts for three years, and the individual remains in employment with the Group, the participant would receive the original shares plus additional shares.
The matching ratio for bonuses is 1:1 to encourage Directors and managers to build a meaningful shareholding in the Group.
Employee Share Ownership Trusts ESOTs The Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Employee and Executive Benefit Trust and the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2001 Employee Benefit Trust have been established to acquire ordinary shares in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, by subscription or purchase, from funds provided by the Group to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise of share options and on the vesting of the share matching and performance-related share awards.

None of the ESOT shares have been allocated to employees or Directors as at 30 September 2005.
All finance costs and administration expenses connected with the ESOTs are charged to the profit and loss account as they accrue.
The Trusts have waived their rights to dividends and the shares held by the Trusts are excluded from the calculation of basic earnings per share.

The shares, representing 1.9% of issued share capital and having an aggregate nominal value of 1,351,500, have not been cancelled but are held in a treasury shares reserve within the profit and loss account reserve and represent a deduction from equity shareholders funds.
20 Acquisitions During the year the Group acquired interests in a number of small businesses, including on 14 September 2005 a 43% interest in Skruf Snus AB.
The fair and book value of the net liabilities acquired were 4m, giving rise to goodwill of 18m.
The acquisition price, including costs, estimated at 14m, was satisfied by cash consideration in the year of 6m with deferred consideration of 8m.
The deferred consideration may increase depending on the performance of the company.
The acquisition agreement relating to the 43% interest in Skruf Snus AB includes a commitment to acquire the remaining shares by mid 2009 and provides the Group with control of the operating and financial policies of Skruf Snus AB including its dividend policy.
Accordingly the acquisition has been accounted for as a 100% owned subsidiary to reflect the substance of the transaction.
The contribution to the Groups performance in the year ended 30 September 2005 was not material.

In the opinion of the Groups lawyers, the Group has meritorious defences to these actions, all of which are being vigorously contested.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, the Directors believe that the pending actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of the operations, cash flow or financial condition of the Group.
23 Pensions The Group operates pension schemes in the UK and overseas, principally those operated by Imperial Tobacco Limited, John Player & Sons Limited, Reemtsma Holding GmbH & Co. KG, Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH and Badische Tabakmanufaktur Roth-Hndle GmbH BTM.
The main schemes are of the defined benefit type and the assets are held in trustee administered funds, apart from the German schemes which are unfunded.
The main UK Group scheme, is the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund the Scheme.
An actuarial valuation of the Scheme was made at 31 March 2004.
The assumptions which had the most significant effect when valuing the Schemes liabilities were those relating to the rate of investment return earned on the Schemes existing assets, the rates of increase in pay and pensions and estimated mortality rates.
On the basis that the Scheme is continuing it was assumed that the future investment returns relative to market values at the valuation date would be 5.85% per annum and that pay and pension increases would average 4.5% and 2.75% per annum respectively.
The assets were brought into account at their market value.
At 31 March 2004 the market value of the assets of the Scheme was 2,248m.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 108% of the benefits that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases.
However the assets were not sufficient to cover future service benefits for current members and, as a result of this deficiency, Imperial recommenced payment of Company contributions during the year at the level of 10m per year as set by the Scheme Actuary.
The financial position of the Scheme and the level of Company contributions to be paid will be reviewed at the next actuarial valuation, expected to be carried out at 31 March 2007.
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 93 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 23 Pensions continued The pension cost in respect of the Scheme, for the year ended 30 September 2005, was 5m 2004: nil.
The regular cost of 24m has been offset by 19m in respect of the amortisation of the experience surpluses that are being recognised over ten years, the average remaining service lives of members.
In prior years, the level of surplus in the Scheme has been sufficient to cover the regular cost.
The pension cost has been assessed in accordance with the advice of Watson Wyatt Limited, actuaries and consultants, using the projected unit method.
Prepaid contributions of 5m are included in debtors at the balance sheet date.
Actuarial valuations of the pension liabilities of Reemtsma Holding GmbH & Co. KG, Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH and BTM pension schemes were undertaken at 30 September 2004 and 30 September 2005.
These quantified unfunded past service liabilities of 324m at 30 September 2004 and 376m at 30 September 2005, which have been recognised in the accounts, together with the other German unfunded schemes.
The assumptions which had the most significant effect when valuing the Schemes liabilities were those relating to the rates of increase in pay and pensions.
These were 2.85% for the increase in pay and 1.60% for the increase in pensions.
The pension cost relating to other overseas schemes is calculated in accordance with local accounting principles.
The pension cost for nonUK schemes in the year was 28m 2004: 32m.
FRS 17 disclosures for the year to 30 September 2005 The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
Full implementation of FRS 17 Retirement benefits, which was to be mandatory for the Group for the year ended September 2003, has been deferred by the Accounting Standards Board until accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005.
However, the following transitional disclosures are still required.
