Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a defined contribution group personal pension scheme and contributes to various other personal pension arrangements for certain directors and employees.
The total of contributions made to this scheme during the year was 370,000 2004: 306,000.
The Group also operates defined contribution schemes for overseas employees, for which the total contributions were 450,000 2004: 503,000.
The Group operates two pension schemes providing benefits based on final pensionable pay for executive directors and staff employed by the Company the Rathbone 1987 Scheme and the Laurence Keen Scheme.
The schemes are currently both clients of Rathbone Investment Management Limited, with investments managed on a discretionary basis.
Scheme assets are held separately from those of the Group.
The scheme operated by Rathbone Stockbrokers Limited the Laurence Keen Scheme was closed to new entrants and future pension accrual for the current membership with effect from 1 October 1999.
As from that date all the active members of the Laurence Keen Scheme were included under the Rathbone 1987 Scheme for accrual of retirement benefits for further service.
The Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 31 March 2002.
Both schemes continue on a closed basis with the existing assets remaining invested thereunder.
com Report and accounts 2005 Page 67 The schemes are valued by independent actuaries every three years using the projected unit credit method which looks at the value of benefits accruing over the years following the valuation date based on projected salary to date of termination of services.
The valuations are updated at each balance sheet date in between full valuations.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at: Latest full actuarial valuation as at: Rathbone 1987 Scheme 31 December 2004 Laurence Keen Scheme 31 December 2002 The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The principal actuarial assumptions used, which reflect the different membership profiles of the schemes, were: 2005 2004 2005 2004 Laurence Laurence Rathbone Rathbone Keen Keen 1987 1987 Scheme Scheme Scheme Scheme Rate of increase in salaries 4.05% 3.65% 4.05% 3.65% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.80% 2.70% 2.80% 2.70% Rate of increase of deferred pensions 2.80% 2.90% 2.80% 2.90% Discount rate 4.90% 5.50% 4.90% 5.50% Expected return on scheme assets 5.99% 6.18% 7.06% 7.29% Inflation assumption 2.80% 2.90% 2.80% 2.90% 5% for service prior to April 2001 The assumed life expectancy for the membership of both schemes is based on the PA92 actuarial tables.
In 2005, the assumption for life expectancy was updated to take account of recent and expected future improvements in life expectancy by using the Medium Cohort projection, rated up by 2 years.
The assumed life expectancy for a male currently aged 60 is 24.6 years under the actuarial tables used in 2005.

The expected rate of return on debt instruments is based on long term yields at the start of the year, with an adjustment for the risk of default and future downgrade in relation to corporate bonds.
Cash has been assumed to generate a similar return to short dated bonds.

Additional lump sum contributions amounting to 1,000,000 were also paid in 2005 2004: nil.
With effect from 1 January 2006, employer contributions to the Rathbone 1987 Scheme have been increased to a rate of 15.5% of pensionable salaries.
With effect from 1 April 2006, each active member of the scheme will be required to elect either to maintain their current rate of contributions but receive a lower benefit accrual rate or to pay a higher rate of contributions whilst maintaining their current benefit accrual rate.
The Group has committed to make additional payments to reduce significantly the current funding deficit and it is expected that these payments will be made during the course of 2006 and 2007.
Given that after 31 March 2002 the Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants, the current pension cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The total contributions made by the Group to the Laurence Keen Scheme during the year were 562,000 2004: 562,000.
Employer contributions of 562,000 p. a. will be paid to the Scheme for ten years from 2004.
As the Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 1 October 1999, the current pension cost will increase as the members of the Scheme approach retirement.
