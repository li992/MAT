Goodwill 2005 2004 m m Cost At 1 January 148.8 143.9 Recognised on acquisition of a subsidiary see note 26 6.7 4.9 At 31 December 155.5 148.8 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: 2005 2004 m m Business Services 80.8 80.8 Infrastructure Services 68.0 68.0 Project Services 6.7 155.5 148.8 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates applied.
Discount rates are estimated by management using post-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
Consequently a post-tax discount rate of 7.6% has been applied to each CGU that is not considered to be exposed to a materially different level of risk.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management for the next three years where the growth rates applied are based on industry growth forecasts.
The forecast cash flow position is extrapolated based on an estimated growth rate of 2.25%.
This rate does not exceed the long term average growth rate for the relevant markets.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.

Savings related share options are normally exercisable during the six-month period following completion of either a three year or five year savings contract.
Awards made under the Restricted Share Plan are normally able to vest between three and seven years from the date of initial award, subject to the Company achieving specific performance targets.
Vesting may be deferred for a further period of three years, during which the shares are held in the Employee Benefit Trust and may become eligible for matching under the rules of the Restricted Share Plan.
On the occasion of the sale of the Homes business, the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion by subjecting all outstanding awards to the performance test.
With the exception of the awards made on 17 July and 29 October 1997 which achieved vesting at 144.79%, the Companys performance was measured as achieving 150% maximum vesting at 1 October 2001.
The proportion of each award deemed to have tested successfully calculated by reference to the proportion of the three year restricted period that had elapsed at 1 October 2001 was then banked until the third anniversary of the grant date, and only the balance of the award has been subjected to subsequent performance tests.
The growth in the Groups earnings per share after adjustment to reflect the disposal of the Homes business over the three year period ending on 2 May 2005 exceeded the Retail Price Index by more than the requisite 9%.
Consequently, 448,500 shares representing 224,250 awards for which vesting had been deferred in May 2002, together with the corresponding matching shares, were released to participants on 16 June 2005.

The expected vesting life is the average expected period to exercise.
The forfeiture rate has been based on the numbers of options forfeited within each scheme over the last three years due to the impacts of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

Alfred McAlpine plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 73 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Other reserves include 53.3m 2004: 53.3m of merger reserve and 8.3m 2004: 8.3m of capital redemption reserve.
The EBT reserve represents the cost of shares in Alfred McAlpine plc purchased in the market and held by the Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy options under the Groups share option schemes.
Cumulative goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings prior to 1 January 1998 of 6.6m 2004: 6.6m remains written off to reserves.
Financial instruments The Groups approach to managing exposures to interest rate, currency and liquidity risks are set out in the financial risk management section on page 54.
Short term debtors and creditors Short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than the currency risk disclosures.
Allowances are made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods and services of 1.8m 2004: 6.6m as determined by reference to past default experience.
Fair values Other than the preference shares, the book value of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at the balance sheet date approximated to their fair value.
The book value of the preference shares was 4.5m 2004: 4.5m compared with a fair value based on market value, of 6.4m 2004: 5.4m.
The fair value of the Groups bank loans approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the loans are floating, with payments reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
The fair value of short term deposits, cash and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of other financial assets approximates to the carrying amount because of the ongoing trading nature of these items and the effect of increasing expected recovery offsetting the effect of discounting.
The fair value of other financial liabilities reflects the discounting of the liabilities at an effective rate of interest of 5%.
Floating rate cash earns interest based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents.

In addition to the above, the Groups provisions of 0.6m 2004: 0.6m for vacant leasehold properties note 18 meet the definition of financial liabilities.
These financial liabilities are considered to be floating rate financial liabilities as, in establishing the provisions, the cash flows have been discounted and the discount rate is re-appraised at each half-yearly reporting date to ensure that it reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The average interest rate in both 2004 and 2005 for preference shares is 9%, and for other fixed rate liabilities is 6.0%.
This is fixed for an indefinite period for the non-redeemable preference shares and for a weighted average period of 4.4 years 2004: 3.0 years for other fixed rate liabilities.
Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates, based on relevant LIBOR equivalents, which are fixed in advance for periods up to three months.
The weighted average period until maturity of financial liabilities on which no interest is paid is 2.0 years 2004: 1.5 years.
The preference shares have the following rights: a a fixed cumulative preference dividend of 9% per annum payable half yearly on 30 April and 31 October: b they rank with regard to dividend including any arrears to the commencement of a winding up and return on capital in priority to ordinary shares.
On a return of assets on liquidation or reduction in capital, there is a premium entitlement calculated in accordance with the terms and conditions of the articles of association but no further right to participate in the profits or assets: c there is no redemption entitlement: and d where any preference dividend is in arrears, holders are entitled to attend any general meeting, with the right to vote on a show of hands or by poll, with one vote for each share held.
At 31 December 2005 there were no bank loans outstanding under the committed revolving credit facilities 2004: nil.
The undrawn elements of the Groups committed borrowing facilities at 31 December 2005 total 105m.
These facilities expire in November 2007 and incur commitment fees at fixed contractual rates.
Since the year-end facilities of 125m have been renegotiated and expire in February 2011.
Currency exposures There are no significant external monetary assets and liabilities held by Group companies in currencies other than their local currency.

Lodge Park post-acquisition profits after tax included in the Group accounts were 2.2m.
Had the acquisition taken place at 1 January 2005, the combined revenue and profit of the Group would have been 1,044.7m and 36.8m respectively.
The fair valuation of net assets acquired is provisional and ongoing, and will be finalised in the 2006 financial statements.

Explanation of transition to IFRS This is the first year that the Group has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The following disclosures are required for the first published results under IFRS.
Reconciliation of equity at 1 January 2004 UK GAAP Effect of transition to IFRS as previously reported IAS 19 IFRS 2 IAS 18 IFRS 3 IAS 10 IFRS m m m m m m m Notes 12345 Non-current assets Property, plant and equipment 53.0 53.0 Goodwill 143.9 143.9 Investments in joint ventures and associates 19.6 19.6 Deferred income tax assets 8.5 32.8 0.4 0.7 25.4 208.0 32.8 0.4 0.7 241.9 Current assets Inventories 24.2 24.2 Construction and other long term contracts 100.1 2.3 97.8 Trade and other receivables 122.8 122.8 Cash and cash equivalents 72.5 72.5 319.6 2.3 317.3 Non-current assets held for sale Total assets 527.6 32.8 0.4 1.6 559.2 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 219.9 1.4 6.5 214.8 Current corporation tax liabilities 2.6 2.6 Obligations under finance leases 1.8 1.8 Preference shares Loans and overdrafts 5.9 5.9 230.2 1.4 6.5 225.1 Non-current liabilities Trade and other payables 1.8 1.8 Retirement benefit obligations 25.8 109.2 83.4 Obligations under finance leases 2.8 2.8 Provisions and other liabilities 2.6 2.6 18.6 109.2 90.6 Total liabilities 211.6 109.2 1.4 6.5 315.7 Net assets 316.0 76.4 1.0 1.6 6.5 243.5 The above figures exclude the impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39 relating to financial instruments as these are only applied from 1 January 2005 see note below.
The Group has adopted IAS 19 Employee Benefits in respect of its defined benefit pension schemes.
The balance sheet impact of the implementation of this standard is to recognise a pension liability of 83.4m in the Groups IFRS balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 in place of the 25.8m SSAP 24 net prepayment previously held under UK GAAP.
Net of the deferred tax associated with both of these balances, the net impact is to reduce consolidated net assets by 76.4m.
Under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment the fair value of the liability for the cash settled elements of share-based payments has been accrued on the balance sheet.
The effect of this is to increase trade and other payables by 1.4m and to reduce consolidated net assets by 1.0m.
IAS 18 Revenue Recognition requires that elements of deferred revenue held on the balance sheet be measured at fair value.
The discounting of such items has reduced the amounts recoverable on construction contracts by 2.3m and consolidated net assets by 1.6m.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations no longer permits the amortisation of goodwill.
Instead goodwill is carried at cost and is subject to regular impairment reviews.
As there is no impairment of goodwill required at 1 January 2004 this has been frozen at UK GAAP levels.
As required by IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, no provision is made within these accounts for the final proposed dividend because at the balance sheet date it was still subject to approval and is thus not considered to be an adjusting event.
The result is a 6.5m increase in reported net assets due to the removal of the 2003 final proposed dividend.
As permitted by IFRS 1 the Group has decided to apply UK GAAP in the comparative information in relation to financial instruments within the scope of IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Had the comparative information been prepared in full compliance with IAS 32 and IAS 39, the main adjustment would have been to the share of reserves consolidated in respect of PFI joint venture arrangements reflecting the fair value of interest rate swaps entered into within these special purpose companies offset by any financial assets held as available for sale assets at fair value.
This would result in a change in the net asset carrying value for these investments and an equal change in consolidated reserves.
In addition, under IAS 32, the Groups 9% cumulative preference shares are classified as borrowings and the dividend payments within net finance costs.

The impact of the transition to IFRS in the year to 31 December 2004 is to increase profit from operations by 1.8m and net finance costs by 3.0m.
The tax charge is reduced by 0.4m.
As required by IFRS 2 Share-based Payment an increase in the cost of share schemes of 0.2m has been charged to profit from operations recognising the fair value of outstanding share options and awards granted since 7 November 2002.
The fair value has been calculated using a variety of valuation models relevant to the nature of the options and is charged to income over the relevant vesting periods, adjusted to reflect actual and expected levels of leavers.
IAS 18 requires revenue to be recognised at its fair value to the Group.
Elements of deferred revenue have been discounted resulting in a reduction in revenue by 0.3m, non-recurring costs by 2.0m, net finance costs by 1.2m and an increase in cost of sales by 2.4m and tax expense by 0.1m.
The impact in the year to 31 December 2004 is a reversal of the amortisation charge of 8.2m.
There are no associated tax impacts.
As permitted within IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and IAS 28 Investments in Associates the Group has opted to equity account for its interests in joint ventures.
Whilst this is a continuation of the equity accounting adopted under UK GAAP, there is a presentational change under IFRS that requires the presentation of the net result after tax as part of the profit from operations.
There is no net profit impact but the result is to reduce profit from operations by 10.0m, net finance costs by 8.9m and tax expense by 1.9m.

The balance sheet impact of the implementation of this standard is to recognise a pension liability of 81.9m in the Groups IFRS balance sheet as at 31 December 2004 in place of the 27.3m SSAP 24 net prepayment previously held under UK GAAP.
Net of the deferred tax associated with both of these balances, the net impact is to reduce consolidated net assets by 76.5m.
The effect of this is to increase trade and other payables by 1.0m and to reduce consolidated net assets by 0.7m.
The discounting of such items has reduced the amounts recoverable on construction contracts by 1.6m and consolidated net assets by 1.1m.
Consequently consolidated net assets increase by 8.2m.
As required by IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date no provision is made within these accounts for the final proposed dividend because at the balance sheet date it was still subject to approval and is thus not considered to be an adjusting event.
The result is a 7.0m increase in reported net assets due to the removal of the 2004 final proposed dividend.
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations allows the reclassification of certain non-current assets as non-current assets held for sale.
All such assets are likely to be sold within 12 months of the balance sheet date and are available for immediate sale in their present condition.
Under UK GAAP, the deferred tax recognised in respect of share-based payments reflected 30% of the accruals on the balance sheet, with no account taken of the intrinsic value of the share options.
Under IAS 12, the deferred tax that is recognised reflects the intrinsic value of the share options as the tax deduction available to the Group reflects the share price at the date the share options are exercised.
The impact of this different methodology of recognised deferred tax on share-based payments is that an additional 0.4m of deferred tax asset is recognised on the balance sheet under IAS 12.
The effect of applying IAS 32 and IAS 39 at 1 January 2005 is: firstly to reduce the carrying value of investments in respect of PFI joint venture arrangements by 2.1m reflecting the fair value of interest rate swaps entered into within these special purpose companies: and to increase non-current liabilities by 4.5m because the Groups 9% cumulative preference shares have been classified as borrowings.
