Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity.
Amounts deferred in this way are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged firm commitments or forecast transactions are recognised in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument recognised in equity are retained until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Liabilities in respect of option agreements Option agreements that allow the Companys equity partners to require the Company to purchase the minority interest are treated as derivatives over equity instruments and are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value.
The fair values of such options are re-measured at each period end.
The movement in the fair value is recognised as income or expense within finance charges in the income statement.
The Company recognises its best estimate of the amount it is likely to pay, should these options be exercised by the minority interests, as a liability in the balance sheet.
