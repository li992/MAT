39 Events after the balance sheet date At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company on 27 January 2006, the shareholders voted to approve the disposal of the Hilton International Hotels Division to HHC.
Completion of the disposal is expected in the first quarter of 2006.
40 Explanation of transition to IFRS This is the first year that the Group has presented its accounts under IFRS.
The following disclosures are required in the year of transition.
The last accounts under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 December 2004 and the date of transition to IFRSs was 1 January 2004.
Notes to the reconciliation of equity and of profit or loss extract from the 2004 accounts : IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 19 requires separate recognition of the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension schemes in the income statement and permits two different approaches for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
The Group has adopted the IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards transitional exemption and recognised the full actuarial pension deficit in equity at the date of transition.
The Group has recognised actuarial gains and losses immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The impact of this policy is to recognise an additional pension liability, net of deferred tax, of 81.3m in the Groups IFRS opening balance sheet at 1 January 2004, 71.2m at 30 June 2004 and 91.1m at 31 December 2004.
The impact of the policy on operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 is a reduction of 1.6m, with a 1.9m charge to net interest and a related tax credit of 1.1m.
For the six months to 30 June 2004, operating profit is increased by 3.4m with interest and related tax charge each increased by 0.8m.
Annual Report and Accounts 87 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS continued 40 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued IAS 12 Income Taxes IAS 12 requires entities to calculate deferred taxation based on temporary differences, which are defined as the difference between the carrying amount of assets liabilities and their tax base.
As a result, the Group has provided an additional 242.4m of deferred tax liabilities in its opening balance sheet that were not required under UK GAAP.
These comprise a 154.7m provision for deferred tax on acquired brands and licences, a 3.5m provision in respect of all rolled over capital gains and a 84.2m provision arising from the potential tax gains on the revaluation of fixed assets.
Where required, deferred tax has been provided on all other IFRS adjustments.
IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments In accordance with IFRS 2 and the transitional exemption permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has recognised a charge reflecting the fair value of outstanding share options granted to employees since 7 November 2002.
The fair value has been calculated using a binomial valuation model and is charged to profit over the relevant option vesting period, adjusted to reflect actual and expected levels of vesting.
The impact of this change has been a charge of 2.0m to operating profit for the year to 31 December 2004 and of 1.0m for the six months to 30 June 2004.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations IFRS 3 prohibits the amortisation of goodwill.
The standard requires goodwill to be carried at cost with impairment reviews both annually and also when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has chosen to apply IFRS 3 prospectively from the date of transition and has chosen not to restate all previous business combinations.
Therefore, goodwill is stated in the opening balance sheet at its UK GAAP carrying value of 1,183.1m with subsequent 2004 amortisation being reversed.
The impact on operating profit after exceptional items and goodwill amortisation is a credit of 71.2m for the year to 31 December 2004 and a credit of 35.4m for the six months to 30 June 2004.
IAS 37 Provisions Under IAS 37, a provision should only be recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation to transfer resources.
For Hilton Group plc, no such obligation to pay a dividend exists until the shareholders give formal approval at the annual general meeting.
Therefore under IFRS, the Group will no longer accrue unapproved dividends at period ends.
This has resulted in an increase in net assets of 87.4m at the opening balance sheet date, 57.0m at the 30 June 2004 and 95.3m at 31 December 2004.
