These statements relate to analyses and other information which are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable.
These statements include, without limitation, those concerning: BTs transformation strategy and its ability to achieve it: expected cost savings: growth of, and opportunities available in, the communications industry and BTs positioning to take advantage of those opportunities: expectations regarding competition, market shares, prices and growth: expectations regarding the convergence of technologies: growth and opportunities in new wave business such as networked IT services, broadband and mobility : BTs network development and plans for the 21st century network: plans for the launch of new products and services: network performance and quality: the impact of regulatory initiatives on operations, including the regulation of the UK xed wholesale and retail businesses: BTs possible or assumed future results of operations and or those of its associates and joint ventures: BTs future dividend policy: capital expenditure and investment plans: adequacy of capital: nancing plans: demand for and access to broadband and the promotion of broadband by third-party service providers: and those preceded by, followed by, or that include the words believes, expects, anticipates, intends or similar expressions.
Due to a number of new and revised Standards included within the body of Standards that comprise IFRS International Financial Reporting Standards, there is not yet a significant body of established practice on which to draw in forming opinions regarding interpretation and application.
Accordingly, practice is continuing to evolve.
At this preliminary stage, therefore, the full financial effect of reporting under IFRS as it will be applied and reported on in the groups first IFRS financial statements cannot be determined with certainty and may be subject to change.
Although BT believes that the expectations reected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these expectations will prove to have been correct.
Because these statements involve risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause differences between actual results and those implied by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: material adverse changes in economic conditions in the markets served by BT and its lines of business: future regulatory actions and conditions in its operating areas, including competition from others in the UK and other international communications markets: selection by BT and its lines of business of the appropriate trading and marketing models for its products and services: technological innovations, including the cost of developing new products and the need to increase expenditures for improving the quality of service: the anticipated benets and advantages of new technologies not being realised: developments in the convergence of technologies: prolonged adverse weather conditions resulting in a material increase in overtime, staff or other costs: the timing of entry and profitability of BT and its lines of business in certain communications markets: significant changes in market shares for BT and its principal products and services: uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates: and general financial market conditions affecting BTs performance.
Certain of these factors are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this annual report including, without limitation, in Risk factors.
BT undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
128 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Additional information for shareholders Listings The principal listing of BT Groups ordinary shares is on the London Stock Exchange.
American Depositary Shares ADSs, each representing 10 ordinary shares, have been issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Depositary for the American Depositary Receipts ADRs evidencing the ADSs, and are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
ADSs also trade, but are not listed, on the London Stock Exchange.
Trading on the New York Stock Exchange is under the symbol BT.
The prices are the highest and lowest closing middle market prices for BT ordinary shares, as derived from the Daily Ofcial List of the London Stock Exchange and the highest and lowest closing sales prices of ADSs, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape.
Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the US dollar affect the dollar equivalent of the pound sterling price of the companys ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange and, as a result, are likely to affect the market price of the ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange.
Capital gains tax CGT The rights issue in June 2001 and the demerger of O2 in November 2001 adjusted the value for capital gains tax purposes of BT shares.
Rights issue An explanatory note on the effects of the rights issue on the CGT position relating to BT shareholdings is available from the Shareholder Helpline see page 139.
Demerger of O2 capital gains tax calculation The confirmed ofcial opening prices for BT Group and O2 shares on 19 November 2001 following the demerger were 285.75p and 82.75p, respectively.
This means that, of the total combined value of 368.50p, 77.544% is attributable to BT Group and 22.456% to O2.
Accordingly, for CGT calculations, the base cost of BT Group shares and O2 shares is calculated by multiplying the acquisition cost of a BT shareholding by 77.544% and 22.456%, respectively.
b Under the BT Group Employee Share Investment Plan, 52 million shares were held in trust on behalf of 84,803 participants who were beneficially entitled to the shares.
136 million shares were held in the corporate nominee BT Group EasyShare on behalf of 127,161 beneficial owners.
c 250 million shares were represented by ADSs.
Analysis by size of holding is not available for this holding.
d 134 million shares were held as treasury shares.
e 13.7% of the shares were in 1,474,873 individual holdings, of which 124,457 were joint holdings, and 86.3% of the shares were in 28,982 institutional holdings.
So far as the company is aware, the company is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or by the UK Government or any other foreign government or by any other natural or legal person severally or jointly.
There are no arrangements known to the company the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of the company.
At 13 May 2005, there were 8,634,629,038 ordinary shares outstanding including 134,277,107 shares held as treasury shares.
At the same date, approximately 25 million ADSs equivalent to 250 million ordinary shares, or approximately 2.9% of the total number of ordinary shares outstanding on that date were outstanding and were held by 2,579 record holders of ADRs.
At 31 March 2005, there were 3,593 shareholders with a US address on the register of shareholders.
Dividends Since shortly after its incorporation in 1984, British Telecommunications plc paid interim dividends annually in February and final dividends in September.
However, as part of BTs debt reduction and restructuring plans, neither a final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2001 nor an interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2002 was paid to shareholders.
A final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2004, was paid on 6 September 2004 to shareholders on the register on 6 August 2004, and an interim dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2005 was paid on 7 February 2005 to shareholders on the register on 31 December 2004.
The dividends paid or payable on BT shares and ADSs for the last five years are shown in the following table.
The dividends on the ordinary shares exclude the associated tax credit.
The amounts shown are not those that were actually paid to holders of ADSs.
For the tax treatment of dividends paid see Taxation of dividends below.
Dividends have been translated from pounds sterling into US dollars using exchange rates prevailing on the date the ordinary dividends were paid.
The US dollar amount of the final dividend of 65 pence per ADS to be paid to holders of ADSs will be based on the exchange rate in effect on 5 September 2005, the date of payment to holders of ordinary shares.
As dividends paid by the company are in pounds sterling, exchange rate uctuations will affect the US dollar amounts received by holders of ADSs on conversion by the Depositary of such cash dividends.
Dividend mandate Any shareholder wishing dividends to be paid directly into a bank or building society account should contact the Shareholder Helpline see page 139.
Dividends paid in this way will be paid through the Bankers Automated Clearing System BACS.

Total shareholder return Total shareholder return TSR is the measure of the returns that a company has provided for its shareholders, reecting share price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends.
It is, therefore, a good indicator of a companys overall performance.
Over the past five years as shown in the TSR chart below, BT Groups TSR as adjusted for the rights issue and demerger was negative 70% compared to a FTSE 100 TSR of negative 12%.
This was primarily due to a fall in BTs share price which, like many stocks in the telecoms, media and technology TMT sector, declined in the first two years of the period.
In the period between the demerger on 19 November 2001 and 31 March 2005, BTs TSR was negative 17%, almost in line with the FTSEurorst 300 Telco Index negative 16%.
However, in the last 12 months, BTs TSR has outperformed both the FTSE 100 and FTSEurorst 300 Telco Index with a 21.8% return compared to a 15.4% return for each of those indices.

Shareholders can choose whether their shares are to be evidenced by share certicates i. e. in certicated form or held in electronic i. e. uncerticated form in CREST the electronic settlement system in the UK.
a Voting rights Subject to the restrictions described below, on a show of hands, every shareholder present in person or by proxy at any general meeting has one vote and, on a poll, every shareholder present in person or by proxy has one vote for each share which they hold.
Voting at any meeting of shareholders is by a show of hands unless a poll is demanded by the chairman of the meeting or by at least five shareholders at the meeting who are entitled to vote or their proxies, or by one or more shareholders at the meeting who are entitled to vote or their proxies and who have, between them, at least 10% of the total votes of all shareholders who have the right to vote at the meeting.
No person is, unless the Board decide otherwise, entitled to attend or vote at any general meeting or to exercise any other right conferred by being a shareholder if he or any person appearing to be interested in those shares has been sent a notice under section 212 of the Companies Act 1985 which confers upon public companies the power to require information with respect to interests in their voting shares and he or any interested person has failed to supply to the company the information requested within 14 days after delivery of that notice.
These restrictions end seven days after the earlier of the date the shareholder complies with the request satisfactorily or the company receives notice that there has been an approved transfer of the shares.
b Variation of rights Whenever the share capital of the company is split into different classes of shares, the special rights attached to any of those classes can be varied or withdrawn either: i with the sanction of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class: or ii with the consent in writing of the holders of at least 75% in nominal value of the issued shares of that class.
At any separate meeting, the necessary quorum is two persons holding or representing by proxy not less than onethird in nominal amount of the issued shares of the class in question but at any adjourned meeting, any person holding shares of the class or his proxy is a quorum.
The company can issue new shares and attach any rights and restrictions to them, as long as this is not restricted by special rights previously given to holders of any existing shares.
Subject to this, the rights of new shares can take priority over the rights of existing shares, or existing shares can take priority over them, or the new shares and the existing shares can rank equally.

d Dividends The companys shareholders can declare dividends by passing an ordinary resolution provided that no dividend can exceed the amount recommended by the directors.

If the directors consider that the profits of the company justify such payments, they can pay interim dividends on any class of shares of the amounts and on the dates and for the periods they decide.
Fixed dividends will be paid on any class of shares on the dates stated for the payments of those dividends.
The directors can offer ordinary shareholders the right to choose to receive new ordinary shares, which are credited as fully paid, instead of some or all of their cash dividend.
Before they can do this, the companys shareholders must have passed an ordinary resolution authorising the directors to make this offer.
Any dividend which has not been claimed for ten years after it was declared or became due for payment will be forfeited and will belong to the company unless the directors decide otherwise.

f Transfer of shares Certicated shares of the company may be transferred in writing either by an instrument of transfer in the usual standard form or in another form approved by the Board.
The transfer form must be signed or made effective by or on behalf of the person making the transfer.

h General meetings of shareholders Every year the company must hold an annual general meeting.

134 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Additional information for shareholders Directors votes A director need not be a shareholder, but a director who is not a shareholder can still attend and speak at shareholders meetings.
Unless the Articles say otherwise, a director cannot vote on a resolution about a contract in which the director has a material interest this will also apply to interests of a person connected with the director.
The director can vote if the interest is only an interest in BT shares, debentures or other securities.
A director can, however, vote and be counted in a quorum in respect of certain matters in which he is interested as set out in the Articles.
Subject to the relevant legislation, the shareholders can by passing an ordinary resolution suspend or relax, among other things, the provisions relating to the interest of a director in any contract or arrangement or relating to a directors right to vote and be counted in a quorum on resolutions in which he is interested to any extent or ratify any particular contract carried out in breach of those provisions.
Directors interests If the legislation allows and the director has disclosed the nature and extent of the interest to the Board, the director can: i have any kind of interest in a contract with or involving BT or in which BT has an interest or with or involving another company in which BT has an interest : ii have any kind of interest in a company in which BT has an interest including holding a position in that company or being a shareholder of that company : iii hold a position other than auditor in BT or another company in which BT has an interest on terms and conditions decided by the Board: and iv alone or through some rm with which the director is associated do paid professional work other than as auditor for BT or another company in which BT has an interest on terms and conditions decided by the Board.
A director does not have to hand over to BT any benefit received or profit made as a result of anything permitted to be done under the Articles.
When a director knows that they are interested in a contract with BT they must tell the other directors.
Retirement of directors Provisions of the legislation which, read with the Articles, would prevent a person from being or becoming a director because that person has reached the age of 70 do not apply to the company.
At every annual general meeting, any director who was elected or last re-elected a director at or before the annual general meeting held in the third year before the current year, shall retire by rotation.
Any director appointed by the directors automatically retires at the next following annual general meeting.
A retiring director is eligible for re-election.
Directors borrowing powers To the extent that the legislation and the Articles allow, the Board can exercise all the powers of the company to borrow money, to mortgage or charge its business, property and assets present and future and to issue debentures and other securities, and give security either outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability or obligation of the company or another person.
The Board must limit the borrowings of the company and exercise all the companys voting and other rights or powers of control exercisable by the company in relation to its subsidiary undertakings so as to ensure that the aggregate amount of all borrowings by the group outstanding, net of amounts borrowed intra-group among other things, at any time does not exceed 35 billion.
Material contracts Excluding contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business, no contracts have been entered into in the two years preceding the date of this document by BT or another member of the group which are, or may be, material to the group or contain a provision under which a member of the group has an obligation or entitlement which is, or may be, material to BT or such other member of the group.
Taxation US Holders This is a summary only of the principal US federal income tax and UK tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs by US Holders as dened below who hold their ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets.
It does not address all aspects of US federal income taxation and does not address aspects that may be relevant to persons who are subject to special provisions of US federal income tax law, including US expatriates, insurance companies, tax-exempt organisations, banks, regulated investment companies, financial institutions, securities broker-dealers, traders in securities who elect a mark-to-market method of accounting, persons subject to alternative minimum tax, investors that directly, indirectly or by attribution own 10% or more of the outstanding share capital or voting power of BT, persons holding their ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a straddle, hedging transaction or conversion transaction, persons who acquired their ordinary shares or ADSs pursuant to the exercise of options or otherwise as compensation, or persons whose functional currency is not the US dollar, amongst others.
Those holders may be subject to US federal income tax consequences different from those set forth below.
For purposes of this summary, a US Holder is a beneficial owner of ordinary shares or ADSs that, for US federal income tax purposes, is: a citizen or individual resident of the United States, a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes created or organised in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust if a US court can exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more US persons are Additional information for shareholders BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 135 authorised to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
If a partnership holds ordinary shares or ADSs, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.
A partner in a partnership that holds ordinary shares or ADSs is urged to consult its own tax advisor regarding the specic tax consequences of owning and disposing of the ordinary shares or ADSs.
In particular, this summary is based on i current UK tax law and UK Inland Revenue practice and US law and US Internal Revenue Service IRS practice, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury regulations, rulings, judicial decisions and administrative practice, all as currently in effect, ii the United Kingdom United States Income Tax Convention that entered into force on 25 April 1980 and the protocols thereto in effect until 31 March 2003 the 1980 Convention, iii the United KingdomUnited States Convention relating to estate and gift taxes, and iv the new United KingdomUnited States Tax Convention that entered into force on 31 March 2003 and the protocol thereto the New Convention, all as in effect on the date of this Annual Report, all of which are subject to change or changes in interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect.
US Holders should be aware that the New Convention generally will have effect in respect of dividends paid in 2004 and all subsequent years.
However, a US Holder entitled to benets under the 1980 Convention could have elected to have the provisions of the 1980 Convention continue until 1 May 2004 if the election to apply the 1980 Convention would have resulted in greater benets to the Holder.
If a US Holder made a valid election in 2003, the discussion below with respect to dividend payments made pursuant to the 1980 Convention would apply to dividends paid by BT prior to 1 May 2004.
The discussion below notes instances where the relevant provisions of the New Convention will produce a materially different result for a validly electing US Holder.
US Holders should note that certain articles in the New Convention limit or restrict the ability of a US Holder to claim benets under the New Convention and that similar provisions were not contained in the 1980 Convention.
US Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the applicability of the Conventions and the consequences under UK, US federal, state and local, and other laws, of the ownership and disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs.
Taxation of dividends The UK currently does not apply a withholding tax on dividends under its internal tax laws.
For US federal income tax purposes, a distribution including any additional dividend income arising from a foreign tax credit claim as described below will be treated as ordinary dividend income.
The amount of the distribution includible in gross income of a US Holder will be the US dollar value of the distribution calculated by reference to the spot rate in effect on the date the distribution is actually or constructively received by a US Holder of ordinary shares, or by the Depositary, in the case of ADSs.
A US Holder who converts the British pounds into US dollars on the date of receipt generally should not recognise any exchange gain or loss.
A US Holder who does not convert the British pounds into US dollars on the date of receipt generally will have a tax basis in the British pounds equal to its US dollar value on such date.
Foreign currency gain or loss, if any, recognised by the US Holder on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the British pounds generally will be US source ordinary income or loss.
Dividends paid by BT to a corporate US Holder will not be eligible for the US dividends received deduction.
For dividend payments subject to the 1980 Convention as described above, a US Holder of ordinary shares or ADSs who is a resident of the US and is not a resident of the UK for the purposes of the 1980 Convention generally is entitled to receive, in addition to any dividend that BT pays, a payment from the UK Inland Revenue in respect of such dividend equal to the tax credit to which an individual resident in the UK for UK tax purposes would have been entitled had that individual received the dividend which is currently equal to one-ninth of the dividend received reduced by a UK withholding tax equal to the amount not exceeding 15% of the sum of the dividend paid and the UK tax credit payment.
At current rates, the withholding tax entirely eliminates the tax credit payment but no withholding in excess of the tax credit payment will be imposed upon the US Holder.
Thus, for example, a US Holder who receives a 90 dividend will also be treated as receiving from the UK Inland Revenue a tax credit payment of 10 one-ninth of the dividend received but the entire 10 payment will be eliminated by UK withholding tax, resulting in a net receipt of 90.
The effect on each US Holder will depend on circumstances that are particular to that Holder.
The foreign tax deemed paid generally will be available as a US credit or deduction.
A US Holder validly electing under the 1980 Convention could elect to receive a foreign tax credit or deduction with respect to any UK withholding tax on IRS Form 8833 Treaty-Based Return Position Disclosure Under Section 6114 or 7701 b.
For purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit, dividends paid on the ordinary shares or ADSs will be treated as income from sources outside the United States and generally will constitute passive income or, for certain Holders, financial services income.
The rules relating to the determination of the foreign tax credit are very complex.
US Holders who do not elect to claim a credit with respect to any foreign taxes paid in a given taxable year may instead claim a deduction for foreign taxes paid.
A deduction does not reduce US federal income tax on a dollar for dollar basis like a tax credit.
The deduction, however, is not subject to the limitations applicable to foreign credits.
There will be no right to any payment from the UK Inland Revenue and no notional UK withholding tax applied to a dividend payment made under the New Convention.
Therefore, it will not be possible for US Holders to claim a foreign tax credit in respect of any dividend payment made by BT in 2004 or from 1 May 2004 in the case of a US Holder who effectively elected to extend the applicability of the 1980 Convention.
US Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine whether the US Holder is eligible for benets under the 1980 Convention and the New Convention, and whether, and to what extent, a foreign tax credit will be available with respect to dividends received from BT.
The US Treasury has expressed concern that parties to whom ADSs are released may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits for US Holders of ADSs.
Accordingly, the analysis of the creditability of British withholding taxes in the case of the US Holder who properly elected to apply the 1980 Convention could be affected by future actions that may be taken by the US Treasury.
136 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Additional information for shareholders Certain US Holders including individuals are eligible for reduced rates of US federal income tax currently at a maximum rate of 15% in respect of qualied dividend income received in taxable years beginning before 1 January 2009.
For this purpose, qualied dividend income generally includes dividends paid by a non-US corporation if, among other things, the US Holders meet certain minimum holding periods and the non-US corporation satisfies certain requirements, including that either i the shares or ADSs with respect to which the dividend has been paid are readily tradeable on an established securities market in the United States, or ii the non-US corporation is eligible for the benets of a comprehensive US income tax treaty such as both Conventions which provides for the exchange of information.
BT currently believes that dividends paid with respect to its ordinary shares and ADSs should constitute qualied dividend income for US federal income tax purposes.
The US Treasury and the IRS have announced their intention to promulgate rules pursuant to which holders of ADSs or ordinary shares, among others, will be permitted to rely on certications from issuers to establish that dividends are treated as qualied dividend income.
Each individual US Holder of ordinary shares or ADSs is urged to consult his own tax advisor regarding the availability to him of the reduced dividend tax rate in light of his own particular situation and regarding the computations of his foreign tax credit limitation with respect to any qualied dividend income paid by BT to him, as applicable.
Taxation of capital gains Unless a US resident carries on a trade through a branch or agency if an individual, or through a permanent establishment if a company in the UK, and the disposal of ordinary shares and or ADSs is related to the activities of that trade, neither UK capital gains tax nor corporation tax is normally charged on US residents who dispose of ordinary shares and or ADSs.
For US federal income tax purposes, a US Holder generally will recognise capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs in an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realised on the disposition and the US Holders adjusted tax basis determined in US dollars in the ordinary shares or ADSs.
Such gain or loss generally will be US source gain or loss, and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the ordinary shares have been held for more than one year at the time of disposition.
Capital gains recognised by an individual US Holder generally are subject to US federal income tax at preferential rates if specified holdings periods are met.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations.
Passive foreign investment company status A non-US corporation will be classied as a Passive Foreign Investment Company a PFIC for any taxable year if at least 75% of its gross income consists of passive income or at least 50% of the average value of its assets consist of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income.
BT currently believes that it did not qualify as a PFIC for the taxable year ending 31 March 2004 for US federal income tax purposes.
If BT were to become a PFIC for any taxable year, US Holders would suffer adverse tax consequences.
These consequences may include having gains realised on the disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs treated as ordinary income rather than capital gains and being subject to punitive interest charges on certain dividends and on the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares or ADSs.
Furthermore, dividends paid by BT would not be qualied dividend income and would be subject to the higher rates applicable to other items of ordinary income.
US Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules to BT.
US information reporting and backup withholding Dividends paid on and proceeds received from the sale, exchange or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and backup withholding at a current rate of 28%.
Certain exempt recipients such as corporations are not subject to these information reporting requirements.
Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a Holder who provides a correct taxpayer identication number or certicate of foreign status and makes any other required certication or who is otherwise exempt.
US persons who are required to establish their exempt status generally must furnish IRS Form W-9 Request for Taxpayer Identication Number and Certication.
Non-US Holders generally will not be subject to US information reporting or backup withholding.
However, such Holders may be required to provide certication of non-US status in connection with payments received in the United States or through certain US-related financial intermediaries.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax.
Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a Holders US federal income tax liability.
A Holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely ling the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.
UK stamp duty A transfer of an ordinary share will generally be subject to UK stamp duty or UK stamp duty reserve tax at 0.5% of the amount or value of any consideration provided.
A transfer of an ordinary share into a clearance service or American depositary system gives rise to a 1.5% charge of either the amount of the consideration provided or the value of the share issued.
No UK stamp duty will be payable on the transfer of an ADS assuming it is not registered in the UK, provided that the transfer documents are executed and always retained outside the UK.
UK inheritance and gift taxes in connection with ordinary shares and or ADSs Where an individual holder, who is not a UK national, of ordinary shares and or ADSs falls within the scope of the UK US Estate and Gift Tax Convention, US-domiciled holders of ordinary shares and or ADSs will not generally be subject to UK inheritance tax on a gift of ordinary shares and or ADSs if the gift is subject to US federal gift tax.
Similarly, Additional information for shareholders BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 137 ordinary shares and or ADSs passing on the death of a US-domiciled shareholder, who is not a UK national, will not generally be subject to UK inheritance tax if the estate is subject to US estate tax.
The rules and scope of domicile are complex and action should not be taken without advice specic to the individuals circumstances.
Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders There are currently no government laws, decrees or regulations in the United Kingdom that restrict the export or import of capital, including, but not limited to, UK foreign exchange control restrictions, or that affect the remittances of dividends or other payments to non-resident holders of the companys ordinary shares, except as otherwise described in Taxation US Holders above.
There are no limitations under the laws of the United Kingdom restricting the right of non-residents to hold or to vote shares in the company.
