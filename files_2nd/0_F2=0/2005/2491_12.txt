qxd 14 3 06 1:02 pm Page 99 Directors Report and Accounts 2005 British American Tobacco 99 QUARTERLY ANALYSES OF PROFIT The gures shown below have been produced using average rates of exchange on a quarterly basis since the beginning of the year.
Thus the discrete quarters have not been restated for subsequent movements in foreign exchange rates during the year, which are reected in the results for subsequent quarters.
However, these results differ in two respects from those reported at each quarter during 2005: a In December 2005, the International Accounting Standards Board issued a clarification on IAS21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Intercompany balances between any subsidiary which may itself be a foreign subsidiary and a foreign subsidiary may form part of the Groups investment in that foreign subsidiary and therefore, subject to certain other tests, the exchange impact can be taken directly to equity rather than to net finance costs in the income statement.
Previously only balances between certain companies qualied for this treatment.
The quarterly results have been adjusted accordingly from those published during the year.
b In the quarterly results reported during 2005, the Group noted that it was reviewing the appropriate treatment of certain fair value changes for derivatives and certain exchange differences, which arise under IFRS, in the context of the adjusted earnings per share calculations.
As described on page 45 note 7, the Group has now decided to make certain adjustments and the adjusted diluted earnings per share below have been adjusted accordingly from those published during the year.
