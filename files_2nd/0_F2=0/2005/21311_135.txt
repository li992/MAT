Economic capital Economic capital Barclays assesses capital requirements by measuring the Group risk profile using both internally and externally developed models.
The Group assigns economic capital primarily within seven risk categories: Credit Risk, Market Risk, Business Risk, Operational Risk, Insurance Risk, Fixed Assets and Private Equity.
The Group regularly enhances its economic capital methodology and benchmarks outputs to external reference points.
The framework has been enhanced to reflect default probabilities during average credit conditions, rather than those prevailing at the balance sheet date, thus seeking to remove cyclicality from the economic capital calculation.
The framework also adjusts economic capital to reflect time horizon, correlation of risks and risk concentrations.
Economic capital is allocated on a consistent basis across all of Barclays businesses and risk activities.
A single cost of equity is applied to calculate the cost of risk.
Economic capital allocations reflect varying levels of risk.
The total average economic capital required by the Group, as determined by risk assessment models and after considering the Groups estimated portfolio effects, is compared with the supply of economic capital to evaluate economic capital utilisation.
Supply of economic capital is calculated as the average available shareholders equity after adjustment and including preference shares.
The economic capital methodology will form the basis of the Groups submission for the Basel II Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP.

Note a Calculated using a five-point average over the year.
b Average economic capital demand for Absa relates to five months of 2005.
As at 31st December 2005 the capital demand amounted to 950m.

e Average goodwill relates to purchased goodwill and intangible assets from business acquisitions.
Absa goodwill is included for five months of 2005.

Barclays PLC Annual Report 2005 303 Economic capital Economic capital supply The Group has determined that the impacts of IFRS should be modified in calculating available funds for economic capital.
This applies specifically to: Cashflow hedging reserve to the extent that the Group undertakes the hedging of future cash flows, shareholders equity will include gains and losses which will be offset against the gain or loss on the hedged item when it is recognised in the income statement at the conclusion of the future hedged transaction.
Given the future offset of such gains and losses, they are excluded from shareholders equity upon which the capital charge is based.
Available for sale reserve unrealised gains and losses on such securities are included in shareholders equity until disposal or impairment.
Such gains and losses will be excluded from shareholders equity for the purposes of calculating the capital charge.
Realised gains and losses, foreign exchange translation differences and any impairment charges recorded in the income statement will impact economic profit.
Retirement benefits liability the Group has recorded a deficit with a consequent reduction in shareholders equity.
This represents a non-cash reduction in shareholders equity.
For the purposes of deriving the capital charge, the Group will not deduct the pension deficit from shareholders equity.
The capital resources to support economic capital comprise adjusted shareholders equity including preference shares but excluding other minority interests.
Preference shares have been issued to optimise the long-term capital base of the Group.
