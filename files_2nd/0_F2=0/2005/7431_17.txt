The full year effective tax rate is 28% 2004: 30% applied to profit before taxation.
The underlying tax rate is 29%, which is lower than last year due to the utilisation of brought forward losses in HMV Canada and which has been further reduced to 28% by the first time recognition of a deferred tax asset in Canada.
The current tax charge is reconciled with the standard rate of UK corporation tax as follows: 2005 2004 000 000 Profit before taxation 133,518 117,646 Corporation tax at UK statutory rate of 30% 40,055 35,294 Effects of: Permanent disallowables including overseas income taxed at different rates 183 167 Fair value and goodwill adjustments 332 771 Tax losses brought forward utilised in period 1,444 569 Tax losses for the period not utilised 969 848 Timing differences 1,184 1,633 Prior period over under provision 34 3 Total current tax charge 38,213 36,271 Key factors affecting the tax charge are: i The tax charge is increased by tax losses generated in overseas territories which are not fully utilised and in respect of which no deferred tax asset is recognised and by non-deductible expenses including non-qualifying depreciation.
ii The tax charge is reduced by the utilisation of overseas losses brought forward and profits of certain overseas territories taxed at rates lower than the UK rate.
iii A deferred tax asset has been recognised for the first time in respect of Canada, reflecting the expectation that taxable profits will be available against which future tax relief can be offset.
iv The deferred tax asset on the balance sheet is largely in respect of UK, Japanese and Canadian timing differences.

Borrowings The following disclosures describe the Companys borrowings and facilities at 30 April 2005 and 24 April 2004.
On 31 March 2005 the Company repaid its existing bank facilities and entered into a new five year 260m revolving credit facility.
58.0m of this facility had been drawn down at 30 April 2005 and is included in the borrowings below.
2 Borrowings are stated gross of cash balances, after unamortised deferred financing fees.
Senior Facility Agreement The syndicated bank Senior Facility Agreement existing at 24 April 2004 was cancelled on 31 March 2005 and all outstanding borrowings were repaid.
On the same day, the Company drew down on a new facility, consisting of a 260m revolving credit facility.
The committed facilities under these agreements are as set out below: Total available at 30 April 24 April 2005 2004 Facility m m Sterling amortising term loan facility 225.0 Multi-currency revolving credit facility 260.0 150.0 Total 260.0 375.0 Deferred financing fees totalling 2.7m relating to the arrangement of the previous Senior Facility Agreement have been charged to the profit and loss account as an exceptional finance cost in the year ended 30 April 2005.
Fees totalling 0.7m relating to the arrangement of the new facility have been deferred and are being amortised over the five year term of the facility.
Interest on advances under the Senior Facility Agreement was payable during the financial year at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 0.875%.
Under the new facility interest is payable at a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 0.5%.
61 HMV Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Notes to the financial statements continued 16.
Borrowings continued Security The borrowings under the Facility Agreement are secured by the Guarantors that comprise HMV Group plc and any wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company who accede to the Senior Facility Agreement as Guarantors.
As a condition of the Agreement, the aggregate gross assets, revenue and earnings before interest and tax of the Guarantors must comprise not less than 70% of the total gross assets, revenue and earnings before tax and interest of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The Guarantors currently comprise HMV Group plc, HMV Music Limited, Waterstones Booksellers Limited, HMV IP Limited and HMV UK Limited.
The Company has granted security comprising first ranking fixed and floating charges over all the assets and undertakings of the Guarantors.
Under their banking arrangements, overdraft and cash balances of the Company and of certain subsidiaries are pooled or offset and cross-guaranteed.
Such pooling and offset arrangements are reflected in the Group balance sheet as appropriate.
Derivatives and other financial instruments Objectives, policies and strategies for the role of derivatives and the other financial instruments The Group finances itself through cash generated by operations and bank borrowings.
The financial instruments of the Group comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources, derivatives and various items including trade debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The Group has committed bank facilities comprising a multi-currency revolving credit facility of 260m, which provides funding for its operations in the UK and indirectly to its operations in other territories, through letter of credit provisions.
The Group may also provide funds to overseas subsidiaries by lending intra-Group on commercial terms, or by issuing a guarantee in respect of local bank borrowings.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions and has procedures in place to monitor and control their use.
The Groups use of derivatives is to modify the currency exposure of its debt to match underlying cash flow and assets, to limit borrowing costs and to hedge product purchases.
In all cases underlying exposures justify the use of derivatives.
The financial risks to which the Group is exposed, described below, are managed by Treasury using policies approved by the Board.
Liquidity risk The Group has committed bank facilities comprising a revolving credit facility of 260m, which together with cash on deposit provides sufficient funding for the Groups operations.
The adequacy of the funding arrangements is reviewed regularly.
Interest rate risk The Groups remaining interest rate swaps matured on 20 May 2005.
With reported net debt of 16.6m at 30 April 2005, having repaid all term debt and being historically in a net cash position at the end of the third quarter, the Group currently considers that there is limited interest rate exposure and thus there are no requirements for interest rate hedging.
The net exposure will continue to be monitored throughout the year.
Counterparty risk Treasury deposits any cash balances that arise with counterparties that have a strong credit rating, with an agreed limit for each counterparty, so as to limit the risk of loss arising from a failure.
Counterparties include AAA-rated Liquidity funds, and various banks.
Foreign exchange risk The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of imports where volumes are significant.
However, the Groups operating businesses generally source the majority of their product from suppliers within their country of operation and so the foreign exchange exposure is small.
The Group is also exposed to foreign currency translation risk through its investment in overseas subsidiaries.
This is partially hedged by local debt, but the Group does not hedge the remaining exposure.
Generally, the Group does not hedge any net translation exposure of overseas earnings, although it may in certain circumstances implement hedges to secure short-term financial objectives.
All Group borrowings are stated gross of deferred financing fees as shown in Note 16 on page 61.

Pension arrangements HMV Group employees are members of a number of pension schemes.
The main scheme that covers employees in the United Kingdom is the HMV Group Pension Scheme the Scheme established with effect from July 1998.
The Scheme The Scheme is based in the UK and has two sections the Pension Benefit Section and the Pension Saver Section.
Pension Benefit Section The Pension Benefit Section is of the defined benefit type and is an Inland Revenue exempt approved scheme for the purpose of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
It is contracted out of SERPS.
The benefits it provides are based on final pensionable pay and are guaranteed to increase in payment by 5% per annum or by the increase in the cost of living, if less.
Members contribute at the rate of 4% of pensionable pay.
A qualified actuary made an actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2004.
The valuation was based on an assumed investment return of 6.5% a year, salary increases of 4.25% a year, and annual pension increases of 2.75%, and used the projected unit method.
The result of the valuation was a level of asset cover of 79%, representing a funding deficit of 11.5m.
The market value of the assets of the Pension Benefit Scheme at 30 June 2004 was about 43.9m.
In the light of the deficit of assets over the cost of benefits, the Group has decided to make three special contributions of 4.4m each on 31 March 2005, 31 May 2005 and 31 May 2006.
The total cost of accruing benefits was given by the actuary as 19.9% of pensionable pay including an allowance for administrative expenses.
During the year members of the Pension Benefit Section paid 4.0%, and the Group contributed at a rate of 12.9% of pensionable pay, giving a total of 16.9%.
Therefore from 1 July 2005 the Group has committed to increasing its employers contributions to a rate of 14.9% of pensionable pay, with the members contribution rate increasing to 5% of pensionable pay.
The Scheme was generally closed to new members with effect from 1 January 2002, with the exception of 543 members who transferred into the Scheme on 31 May 2003 from the EMI Group Pension Fund as a result of the Groups flotation on the London Stock Exchange.
The next actuarial review will take place no later than 30 June 2007.
In addition to the special 4.4m contribution paid on 31 March 2005, actual employer contributions to the Pension Benefit Section and the profit and loss account charge for the year ended 30 April 2005 were 3.0m 2004: 3.0m.
Pension Saver Section The Pension Saver Section is of the defined contribution type and is open to all permanent and temporary staff of the Group aged between 18 and 64 years.
Members can choose to pay from 2% to 5% of pensionable pay.
The Group matches the amount paid by the member up to a maximum of 5% of pensionable pay.
Members have a choice of ways to invest their and the Groups contributions in an individual fund to buy pension benefits of their choice.
It also provides life assurance whilst members are employed by the Group.
