Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
The businesses acquired in 2005 contributed 52m a76m to revenue, 7m a10m to adjusted operating profit, reduced net profit by 4m a6m and contributed 8m a12m to net cash inflow from operating activities for the part year under Reed Elsevier ownership.
Had the businesses been acquired at the beginning of the year, on a proforma basis, the Reed Elsevier combined revenues, adjusted operating profit and net profit for the year would have been 5,230m a7,636m, 1,151m a1,680m and 464m a677m respectively.
