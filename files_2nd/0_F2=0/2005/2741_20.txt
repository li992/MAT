62 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS For the year ended 31 December 2005 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of preparation Cairn prepares its accounts on a historical cost basis.
Where there are assets and liabilities calculated on a different basis, this fact is disclosed in the relevant accounting policy.
b Accounting standards Cairn prepares its accounts in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU.
These are the first financial statements of Cairn to have been prepared under IFRS and the disclosures required by IFRS 1 First time adoption of IFRS concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 32.
Relevant new IFRS issued and adopted by the EU but not yet effective and not applied in these financial statements are as follows: Title Change to accounting policy Date of adoption by Cairn Impact on initial application Effective date from 1 January 2006 IFRIC 4 Determining No changes to 1 January 2006 IFRIC 4 provides guidance on determining whether an current accounting whether arrangements that do not take the arrangement contains policy legal form of a lease should, nonetheless, a lease be accounted for in accordance with IAS 17 Leases.
It speci es that an arrangement contains a lease if it depends on the use of a speci c asset and conveys a right to control the use of that asset.
A review of any such arrangements will be undertaken and, if appropriate, accounted for in accordance with IAS 17.
No signi cant impact is expected.
IFRIC 5 Rights to No changes to 1 January 2006 IFRIC 5 provides additional guidance on how interests arising from current accounting to account for expected reimbursements decommissioning, policy from funds set up to meet the costs of restoration and decommissioning plant or equipment or in environmental undertaking environmental restoration and rehabilitation funds rehabilitation.
Cairn is not a participant in any such funds at the present time.
Consequently, no impact is expected to arise.
Effective date from 1 January 2007 IFRS 7 Financial No changes to 1 January 2007 Additional disclosures regarding financial Instruments: current accounting instruments Disclosures and policy amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and presentation Amendment to IAS No changes to 1 January 2007 Additional disclosures required concerning an 1 Presentation of current accounting entitys capital Financial Statements policy Capital Disclosures 63 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED No other IFRS issued and adopted but not yet effective are expected to have an impact on the Groups financial statements.
During the year, Cairn early adopted IFRS 6 Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources which did not become effective until 1 January 2006.
During the year, Cairn adopted IAS 32 Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation and IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
Also during the year, Cairn adopted IFRS 5 Non current assets held for sale and discontinued operations which became effective on 1 January 2005. c Presentational currency The functional currency of Cairn Energy PLC, the ultimate parent company of the Group, is Sterling.
These accounts have been presented in $, the functional currency of most companies within the Group.
This is a change from prior years when the accounts were presented in the functional currency of the parent.
It is deemed to be more appropriate to present the financial statements in line with the functional currency of the majority of the Group.
The Groups policy on foreign currencies is detailed in note 1 p. d Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the results of Cairn Energy PLC and its subsidiary undertakings to the Balance Sheet date.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are included in the Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate.
Cairn allocates the purchase consideration of any acquisition to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Any goodwill arising is recognised as an asset and subject to annual review for impairment.
Business combinations arising prior to the Groups transition date to IFRS 1 January 2004 have not been revisited under the exemption provided by IFRS 1.
Deferred tax liabilities have, however, now been recognised on fair value adjustments that arose from past business combinations in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes.
Cairn has used the exemption granted under s230 1 b of the Companies Act 1985 that allows for the non disclosure of the Income Statement of the parent company.
The loss attributable to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2005 was $11,214,000 2004 restated: loss $22,450,000.
e Joint ventures Cairn participates in several joint ventures which involve the joint control of assets used in the Groups oil and gas exploration and producing activities.
Cairn accounts for its share of the assets and liabilities of joint ventures in which the Group holds a participating interest, classi ed in the appropriate Balance Sheet heading.
f Revenue and other income Revenue from operating activities Revenue represents Cairns share of oil, gas and condensate production, recognised on a direct entitlement basis and tariff income received for third party use of operating facilities and pipelines in accordance with agreements.
Other income Income received as operator from joint ventures is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with joint venture agreements and is included as a deduction from administrative expenses.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis and is recognised within Finance income in the Income Statement.
Other income is not included within Revenue disclosed on the face of the Income Statement but is disclosed in total income as per note 2. g Oil and gas intangible exploration appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment - development producing assets Cairn follows a successful efforts based accounting policy for oil and gas assets.
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately to the Income Statement.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a licence by licence basis.
Costs are held, undepleted, within exploration until such a time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial reserves have been discovered.
64 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued g Oil and gas intangible exploration appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment - development producing assets continued Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining exploration targets is capitalised initially within exploration appraisal assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities.
Exploration appraisal drilling costs are initially capitalised on a well by well basis until the success or otherwise of the well has been established.
The success or failure of each exploration appraisal effort is judged on a well by well basis.
Drilling costs are written off on completion of a well unless the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial.
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction demonstrated, then the related capitalised exploration appraisal costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within development producing assets after testing for impairment see below.
Where results of exploration drilling indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written off to the Income Statement.
All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons has been demonstrated are capitalised within development producing assets on a field by field basis.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development producing asset or replaces part of the existing development producing asset.
Any costs remaining associated with the part replaced are expensed.
Net proceeds from any disposal of an exploration asset are initially credited against the previously capitalised costs.
Any surplus proceeds are credited to the Income Statement.
Net proceeds from any disposal of development producing assets are credited against the previously capitalised cost.
A gain or loss on disposal of a development producing asset is recognised in the Income Statement to the extent that the net proceeds exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs of the asset.
Depletion Cairn depletes separately, where applicable, any signi cant components within development producing assets, such as elds, processing facilities and pipelines which are signi cant in relation to the total cost of a development producing asset.
Cairn depletes expenditure on property, plant & equipment - development producing assets on a unit of production basis, based on proved and probable reserves on a eld by eld basis.
In certain circumstances, elds within a single development area may be combined for depletion purposes.
Impairment Exploration appraisal assets are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment and costs are written off where circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable.
In such circumstances the exploration appraisal asset is allocated to development producing assets within the same geographic segment, as disclosed in the segmental analysis notes to the financial statements, and tested for impairment.
Any such impairment arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the period.
Where there are no development producing assets within a geographic segment, the exploration appraisal costs are charged immediately to the Income Statement.
Impairment reviews on development producing assets are carried out on each cash-generating unit identi ed in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Cairns cash-generating units are those assets which generate largely independent cash ows and are normally, but not always, single development areas.
At each reporting date, where there are indicators of impairment, the net book value of the cash-generating unit is compared with the associated expected discounted future net cash ows.
If the net book value is higher, then the difference is written off to the Income Statement as impairment.
Discounted future net cash ows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using an estimated oil price of $20 bbl 2004: $20 bbl or the appropriate gas price as dictated by the relevant gas sales contract, escalation for prices and costs of 3% and a discount rate of 10% 2004: 3% and 10% respectively.
Forecasted production pro les are determined on an asset by asset basis, using appropriate petroleum engineering techniques.
Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier period that charge will be reversed in a later period where there has been a change in circumstances to the extent that the discounted future net cash ows are higher than the net book value at the time.
In reversing impairment losses, the carrying amount of the asset will be increased to the lower of its original carrying value or the carrying value that would have been determined net of depletion had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.

Investments are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment.
k Inventory Inventories of oil and condensate held at the Balance Sheet date are valued at net realisable value based on the estimated selling price in accordance with established industry practice.
l Financial instruments Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the original invoiced amount less any allowances for doubtful debts.
Other debtors are recognised and measured at nominal value.
Trade and other receivables are recognised when invoiced.
Bank deposits Bank deposits with an original maturity of over three months are held as a separate category of current asset and presented on the face of the Balance Sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Trade payables and other creditors Trade payables and other creditors are non-interest bearing and are measured at cost.
Interest bearing bank loans Interest bearing bank loans represent amounts drawn under the Groups revolving credit facilities, classi ed according to the length of time remaining under the respective facility.
Interest payable is accrued in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs Interest payable and exchange differences incurred on borrowings directly attributable to development projects are capitalised within the development producing asset.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
m Equity Equity instruments issued by Cairn are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, allocated between share capital and share premium.
66 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued n Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on taxable pro t for the year.
Taxable pro t differs from net pro t as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable pro t. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable pro t will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised.
In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable pro t will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that suf cient taxable pro t will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where they arise within the same entity and tax jurisdiction.
o Decommissioning At the end of the producing life of a eld, costs are incurred in removing and decommissioning production facilities.
Cairn recognises the full discounted cost of decommissioning as an asset and liability when the obligation to rectify environmental damage arises.
The decommissioning asset is included within property, plant and equipment development producing assets with the cost of the related installation.
The liability is included within provisions.
Revisions to the estimated costs of decommissioning which alter the level of the provisions required are also re ected in adjustments to the decommissioning asset.
The amortisation of the asset, calculated on a unit of production basis based on proved and probable reserves, is included in the Depletion and decommissioning charge in the Income Statement, and the unwinding of discount of the provision is included within Finance costs.
p Foreign currencies In the accounts of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are taken to the Income Statement except for those incurred on borrowings speci cally allocable to development projects, which are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
Cairn maintains the accounts of all subsidiary undertakings in their functional currency, which for all material subsidiaries is $.
Where applicable, Cairn translates subsidiary accounts into the presentational currency, $, using the closing rate method for assets and liabilities, which are translated into $ at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date, and rates at the date of the transactions for Income Statement accounts.
Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets of Group companies whose functional currency is non $ directly to reserves.
On transition to IFRS Cairn has taken advantage of the exemption offered under IFRS 1 and assumed zero brought forward translation differences on subsidiary undertakings as at 1 January 2004.
67 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Rates of exchange to $1 were as follows: 31 December Average 31 December Average 2005 2005 2004 2004 Sterling 0.578 0.549 0.521 0.546 q Pension schemes Cairn operates fide ned contribution pension schemes in the UK and India.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of Cairn and its subsidiaries.
Cairn also operates an insured bene t scheme for certain Indian employees as required under Indian legislation.
In accordance with IAS 19 Employee Bene ts this is treated as a fide ned contribution scheme.
The pension cost charged represents contributions payable in the year in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
r Leasing commitments Cairn charges rental payable under operating leases to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
s Share schemes The cost of awards to employees under Cairns LTIP and share option plans are recognised over the three year period to which the performance relates.
The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the shares as measured at the date of the award.
The shares are valued using a binomial model.
Shares acquired to meet awards under these shares schemes are held by the ESOP Trust.
The accounts of the ESOP Trust are aggregated into these financial statements.
The costs of awards to employees, in the form of cash but based on share performance phantom options are recognised over the period to which the performance relates.
The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the liability arising from the transaction.
t Exceptional items Exceptional items are those not considered to be part of the normal operation of the business.
Such items are identi ed as exceptional and a full explanation is given in the notes to the accounts.
u Key estimations and assumptions The Group has used estimates and assumptions in arriving at certain gures within the financial statements.

The Groups strategy has been to finance its operations through a mixture of retained pro ts and bank borrowings.
Other alternatives like equity finance and project finance are reviewed by the Board, when appropriate, to fund substantial acquisitions or oil and gas development projects.
The Group treasury function is responsible for managing investment and funding requirements including banking and cash ow monitoring.
It must also recognise and manage interest and foreign exchange exposure whilst ensuring that Cairn has adequate liquidity at all times in order to meet its immediate cash requirements.
Cairn may from time to time, opt to use derivative financial instruments to minimise its exposure to uctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and movements in oil and gas prices.
Derivative financial instruments have not been used throughout 2004 or 2005.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, Cairns policy that no trading in derivative financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from Cairns financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, commodity price risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below.
In addition, a $35m facility is in place to cover the issue of bank guarantees.
Fixed rates of interest apply to this facility.
Liquidity risk Cairn has $240m $40m 7 year and $200m 3 year unsecured committed multicurrency revolving credit facilities available under corporate bilateral agreements to fund its activities.
These revolving credit facilities give the Group exibility to borrow and repay debt as and when appropriate.
No debt was drawn at 31 December 2005 under these facilities 2004: $nil.
The Group currently has surplus cash which it has placed on short and medium term deposit, ensuring suf cient liquidity to enable the Group to meet its short medium term expenditure requirements.
87 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Interest rate risk Surplus funds are placed on short medium term deposit at oating rates.
It is Cairns general policy to deposit funds with a bank or banks that offer the most competitive interest rate at time of issue.
Short medium term borrowing arrangements are available at oating rates.
The treasury function may from time to time opt to manage a proportion of the interest costs on this debt by using derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps.
At this time, however, there is no requirement for such instruments as there is no debt drawn.
Foreign currency risk Cairn manages exposures that arise from receipt of revenues in foreign currencies, by matching receipts and payments in the same currency, and actively managing the residual net position.
In order to minimise Cairns exposure to foreign currency uctuations, currency assets are matched with currency liabilities by borrowing or entering into foreign exchange contracts in the applicable currency if deemed appropriate.
The loan facilities allow loans denominated in $, Sterling, Euro or such other currency as may be agreed between the lenders and Cairn from time to time.
Cairn now reports in $ which, with most assets $ denominated, minimises the impact of foreign exchange movements on the Groups Balance Sheet.
No forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into during 2005.
There were no outstanding foreign exchange contracts at the start of the year or at the end of the year.
Commodity price risk There are implicit product price hedges in place through the pricing mechanisms applicable to Sangu, Lakshmi and Ravva Gas Sales Contracts GSCs.
The requirement for hedging instruments to unwind these pricing mechanisms is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
These implicit product price hedges do not give rise to any embedded derivatives under IAS 39.
Ravva oil sales are required to be made to approved government nominated buyers at oating prices.
No commodity price hedging contracts have been entered into during 2005.
There were no outstanding commodity price contracts at the start of the year or at the end of the year.
Credit risk Cairn has obtained payment guarantees or letters of credit from buyers as payment security on both the Lakshmi and Sangu GSCs.
With respect to Ravva there is no payment security, however the buyers have been nominated by the GoI.
With respect to deposit and treasury arrangements, as a general rule Cairn only use banks that have a Moodys rating for long term deposits of A and above.
Banks rated A offer good credit quality.
The Board will continue to assess the Groups strategies for managing credit risks but at this time they view existing policies as satisfactory for oil and gas sales in South Asia.
At the year end the Group does not have any signi cant concentrations of bad debt risk and overall the exposure to bad debts is not considered to be signi cant.

90 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 30 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Ravva Arbitration The calculation of the GoI share of petroleum produced from the Ravva oil eld has been a matter of disagreement for some years and the disputed issues were put to arbitration in 2002 with a view to binding all parties to the arbitration panels decision.
The arbitration panel opined in October 2004 and Cairn has been willing to be bound by the award, although it was not as favourable as had been hoped.
The GoI, however, has lodged an appeal in the Malaysian courts against one issue the ONGC carry which the panel found in Cairns favour.
This one issue has the largest economic impact.
Cairn has challenged both the GoIs right to appeal, and the grounds of that appeal.
If the GoI were successful on both these points, it is unclear what process would then follow to resolve the original issue under dispute.
Cairn will defend its right to continue to refer to the existing arbitration panel, whose composition and terms of reference were agreed by all parties at the outset.
In the event that the GoIs appeal succeeded and a process then ensued which concluded with the arbitration award on the ONGC carry being reversed in a manner and a forum which Cairn accepted as binding, then Cairn would be due to pay an additional $63.9m.
As the GoI share of pro t petroleum is now agreed by all to have reached maximum entitlement, there would be no additional impact on Cairns oil and gas reserves.

IFRS continued Reconciling items between UK GAAP and IFRS a IFRS 6 adjustments Pre-exploration write-offs Under IFRS 6, costs incurred prior to the legal rights to explore an area being obtained may no longer be capitalised within exploration appraisal assets.
Such costs incurred by Cairn in prior years totalling 18.7m, including general exploration appraisal costs not related to a speci c licence, have therefore been written off through retained earnings as at 31 December 2003.
During 2004 Cairn incurred pre-exploration costs of 37,000 which have been expensed through the Income Statement see h below.
Impairment of exploration appraisal assets Previously under UK GAAP and the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP issued by the Oil Industry Accounting Committee OIAC, where indicators of impairment existed on an asset held within the exploration appraisal cost pool, an impairment test was performed.
Any resulting impairment of an exploration appraisal asset led to a transfer of the impaired amount into the depletable development producing cost pool, the latter being subject to a separate impairment test.
Under IFRS 6, where indicators of impairment exist on an exploration appraisal asset, an impairment test is performed by assigning the asset to the associated development producing assets within the same geographic segment and testing this combined cost against future net discounted cash ows including any associated with the exploration appraisal asset.
Any impairment arising would be recognised directly in the Income Statement for the period.
Where no development producing assets exists, impairment losses arising on the exploration appraisal would be written off immediately to the Income Statement.
As a consequence of this change, previous transfers between Cairns exploration appraisal and development producing cost pools of 4.2m, which arose from the impairment of exploration appraisal assets, have been reversed.
Impairment tests have then been reperformed using the IFRS approach with no impairment losses arising.
b Fair value adjustments Cairn has elected to measure certain development producing assets at the transition date to IFRS at fair value and use this fair value as their deemed cost, as allowable under IFRS 1.
The total of deemed cost calculated by reference to fair value can be seen on the Balance Sheet reconciliations under column b Fair value adjustments on the Property, plant & equipment development producing assets line.
As a result of measuring at fair value at transition date, the exceptional gain on sale under UK GAAP of the sale of the Groups North Sea producing asset in 2004 now results in neither a gain nor a loss being recognised.
c Unsuccessful exploration appraisal costs Cairn previously followed the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas assets.
Under this method, all expenditure incurred in connection with and directly attributable to the acquisition, exploration, appraisal and development of oil and gas assets were capitalised in two geographical cost pools: South Asia and North Sea.
Following guidance from IFRIC in November 2005 it is no longer permissible to continue this treatment for development producing assets.
Cairn has therefore decided to change accounting policies for both exploration appraisal and development producing assets to a successful efforts based policy.
Under the Groups new policy unsuccessful exploration costs previously capitalised subject to impairment reviews are now written off in the period in which they are determined to be unsuccessful.
The adjustments for unsuccessful costs written off in the period have been made against the Balance Sheet classi cations as used under the UK GAAP full cost accounting methodology.
d Depletion and decommissioning The adjustments to depletion and decommissioning re ect the revised carrying value of the development producing assets as a result of the pre-exploration write offs, fair value adjustments and the write off of exploration appraisal costs as per notes a to c above.
Depletion is now charged on a eld by eld basis, with certain elds within development areas being combined where appropriate.
It is also now calculated in the functional currency of $ rather than in Sterling as was previously the case under UK GAAP.
e Foreign currency translation IAS 21 requires that the functional currency for each subsidiary within the Group be determined.
Where the functional currency is different from the Groups Sterling presentational currency, all assets and liabilities of those subsidiaries should be converted to Sterling at closing rates on consolidation.
99 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Given that the Groups income and expenses are mainly received and incurred in $, the majority of the Groups subsidiary undertakings have a $ functional currency.
This includes UK based subsidiaries holding oil and gas exploration appraisal and development producing assets.
These subsidiaries were fully translated from $ to Sterling at the closing rate at the Balance Sheet date on consolidation rather than historic Sterling conversions in the 2004 restated results presented in Sterling.
In accordance with IAS 21, cumulative exchange differences are now recognised as a separate component within equity.
Cairn has taken advantage of the exemptions offered under IFRS 1 and deemed cumulative translation differences to be zero at 31 December 2003. f Taxation Deferred tax liabilities arising from fair value adjustments made in prior business combinations have been recognised on transition to IFRS.
Such liabilities were speci cally excluded from recognition under UK GAAP.
These deferred tax liabilities are only likely to crystallise on disposal of the assets concerned and will reduce as the carrying values of the underlying assets are depleted on a unit of production basis.
A deferred tax asset has been created as at 31 December 2004 due to the lower net book values arising under the successful efforts based accounting policy and the associated recognition requirements under IFRS.
g Share based payments In accordance with IFRS 2, Cairn has recognised a charge for share awards made to employees under its LTIP and share option plans since 7 November 2002.
This charge is based on the fair value of these awards.
The fair value has been calculated using a binomial valuation model and is charged to the Income Statement over the relevant vesting period, adjusted to re ect actual and expected levels of vesting.
In accordance with IFRS, only awards made after 7 November 2002 should be charged through the Income Statement, therefore LTIP charges relating to awards made prior to this date have been reversed.
Share options awarded prior to this date were not previously charged to the Income Statement.
The reconciling credit of 3.7m between the UK GAAP and the IFRS Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2004 is a consequence of the differing fair value methodologies of the binomial valuation model used to fair value LTIP awards under IFRS 2 from that previously used to fair value such awards under UK GAAP, the charge relating to share options awarded post 7 November 2002 and the credit for LTIP charges relating to awards prior to this date.
h Other adjustments 1 Cairn have introduced an accrual of 55,000 at 31 December 2003, increasing to 104,000 at 31 December 2004 relating to employees entitlements to annual leave, as required by IAS 19 Employee bene ts.
2 Pre-exploration costs of 37,000 have been expensed during 2004 see note a above.
3 The following reclassi cations have been made in accordance with IAS 1, which requires separate disclosure of certain assets and liabilities on the face of the Balance Sheet: Oil and condensate inventory of 2.3m at 31 December 2003 and 1.1m at 31 December 2004 has been reclassi ed from trade and other receivables: Current taxation liabilities of 5.7m at 31 December 2003 and 2.9m at 31 December 2004 have been reclassi ed from trade and other payables: and Computer software costs previously held as tangible xed assets and within prepayments have been reclassi ed to intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible assets.
4 In accordance with the Groups revised accounting policy, cash and cash equivalents include only short-term deposits with a maturity of less than three months.
As a consequence, 8.0 million of long term deposits at 31 December 2004 have been reclassi ed to bank deposits.
i Cash flow statements The IFRS Cash Flow Statement, prepared under IAS 7 Cash ow statements, presents cash ows in three categories: cash ows from operating activities, cash ows from investing activities and cash ows from nancing activities.
This is fewer than the previous seven categories under UK GAAP.
Other than the reclassi cation of cash ow items into the new disclosure categories, there are no signi cant differences between the Groups Cash Flow Statement under UK GAAP and IFRS.
