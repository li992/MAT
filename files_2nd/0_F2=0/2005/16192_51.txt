Transition to IFRS For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2004, the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
These financial statements, for the year ended 31 December 2005, are the first the Group is required to prepare in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and the International Accounting Standards Board.
Accordingly, the Group has prepared financial statements which comply with IFRS applicable for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and the significant accounting policies adopted are shown above.
In preparing these financial statements, the Group has started from an opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2004, the Groups date of transition to IFRS, and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements required by IFRS 1 for the first time adoption of IFRS.
This note explains the principal adjustments made by the Group in restating its UK GAAP Balance Sheet as at 1 January 2004 and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The restatement of the Groups 2004 results under IFRS were published on the Tullow website www.
Exemptions applied IFRS 1 allows exemptions from the application of certain IFRS to assist companies with the transition process.
Accordingly the Group has made the following first time accounting policy choices: IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments is applied to all share-based rewards made after 7 November 2002 that did not vest before 1 January 2005 IFRS 3 Business Combinations prior to 1 January 2004 have not been restated IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement will be applied prospectively from 1 January 2005 and as such the 2004 restated information presented excludes adjustments required on adoption of these Standards The Group has availed of the early adoption of IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources with effect from 1 January 2004.
The Standard does not impact on the Groups existing policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure.
The adjustments to the 2004 UK GAAP financial statements can be explained as follows: IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments Tullow is committed to allowing employees the opportunity to participate in the ongoing growth and success of the Company and since 1988 has operated a variety of Share-based schemes including an Executive Share Option Scheme, a Performance Share Plan and Employee Share Incentive Plans.
Under UK GAAP no adjustment was made to the financial statements when options were granted as under the 1988, 1998 and 2000 Executive Share Option Schemes the options were granted at market value.
Adjustments were made to the financial statements only when the options were exercised.
IFRS 2 requires such share-based payments by the Group to employees to be fair valued at grant date using an option pricing model and charged through the income statement over the vesting period of the relevant awards.
The accounting change has reduced profit by 0.33 million in the year ended 31 December 2004.
