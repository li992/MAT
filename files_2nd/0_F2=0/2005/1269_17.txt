co. uk EXTRACTS FROM THE REPORT ON TRANSITION TO IFRS Press release dated 8 September 2005 Summary The main impacts of IFRS on the Groups reported results for the year ended 31 December 2004 are shown below: An increase in profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 10.9 million, principally the result of acquired goodwill no longer being amortised Basic earnings per share for the same period increases from 36.2 pence to 42.6 pence, principally the result of not amortising goodwill.
Earnings per share, excluding goodwill impairment, intangible asset amortisation and exceptional items, increases marginally from 44.9 pence to 45.1 pence Net assets at 1 January 2004 decreased by 107.8 million, mainly arising from: Recognition of obligations in respect of defined benefit pension schemes decrease 174.8 million, and a related intangible asset increase 12.0 million Recognition of fair value of UK land and buildings as deemed cost increase 24.6 million Elimination from liabilities of 2003 final dividend increase 26.1 million Net debt decreases by 7.9 million at 30 June 2004 and by 3.4 million at 31 December 2004 due to the proportional consolidation of joint venture cash.
Impact of key changes Employee benefits: defined benefit pension schemes IAS19 The Group has previously accounted for pensions under UK GAAP using SSAP24.
In addition, the Group has previously made disclosures in its notes to the accounts required by the transitional rules of FRS17.
The Group will not be adopting FRS17 for measurement purposes, and has moved directly from SSAP24 to IAS19 for the year ending 31 December 2005 and restated comparatives for 2004.
The pension charge for the year ended 31 December 2004 was 0.1 million lower under IAS19 than SSAP24.
Group defined benefit schemes IAS19 requires the recognition on the balance sheet of the assets and obligations of the Groups defined benefit schemes in accordance with its own requirements and the fide-recognition of balances relating to SSAP24.
This represents a significant change in balance sheet treatment and at 1 January 2004 results in a reduction in net assets of 162.8 million, net of deferred tax.
Subsequent to the initial recognition above, the pension deficit will be calculated at each year end.
The profit and loss account will be charged with the estimated cost of providing current service benefits, together with a pension finance charge or credit representing the difference between the expected return on the schemes assets and the interest charged on the schemes liabilities.
Both the service cost and pension finance charge credit will be reported as part of net operating expenses.
Movements in the pension deficit arising from actuarial gains and losses and changes to actuarial assumptions will be charged or credited in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense in the period in which they arise.
Railways Pension Scheme Most employees in our UK Trains business are members of certain sections of the Railways Pension Scheme.
The agreement under which the Group operates the Arriva Trains Wales franchise states that all pension obligations to the scheme will cease on expiry of the franchise, and therefore the obligations recognised on the balance sheet under IAS19 should only be those arising during the franchise term.
The amended obligation will be made by way of a franchise adjustment to the pension obligation.
The Groups current franchise commenced operation in December 2003.
At the time, the anticipated contribution levels and investment returns were sufficient to reduce the IAS19 pension deficit to nil by the end of the franchise.
Accordingly there is no franchise adjustment made on transition at 1 January 2004, and the full IAS19 liability of 12.0 million is reported in the balance sheet.
Also on transition, an associated intangible asset has been recognised of the same amount.
This is considered further under the heading Intangible assets below.
At 31 December 2004, the full IAS19 liability is calculated as 13.1 million.
The franchise adjustment, which represents the present value of the IAS19 liability at the end of the current franchise is 2.3 million, resulting in a reported pension obligation of 10.8 million.
UK properties revaluation IFRS1 The Group has elected to use the fair value of the UK land and buildings at 1 January 2004 as deemed cost.
This has resulted in an increase in net assets at transition of 24.6 million, net of deferred tax, and an increase in depreciation for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 0.4 million.
No adjustment has been made to the carrying value of non-UK land and buildings.
Dividends proposed IAS10 IAS10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, does not permit the recognition of a liability for dividends until they have been approved.
On this basis, dividends approved after the year end cannot be recognised as a liability in those year end accounts.
The final dividend declared for the year ended 31 December 2003 was approved in April 2004, and therefore requires reversing in the transitional balance sheet at 1 January 2004.
Net assets are increased on transition by 26.1 million, and at 31 December 2004 by a further 1.4 million.
Arriva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 77 EXTRACTS FROM THE REPORT ON TRANSITION TO IFRS Press release dated 8 September 2005 continued Business combinations IFRS3 On transition, the Group has taken the option under the transitional arrangements not to apply IFRS3 Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations that occurred prior to the transition date.
Accordingly, except for the adjustment required to negative goodwill noted below, the goodwill carried in the balance sheet under UK GAAP at 31 December 2003 has become the opening balance of goodwill under IFRS at 1 January 2004.
IFRS3 does not permit the annual amortisation of goodwill, but does require an annual impairment review of carrying values.
Impairment reviews have been conducted on the carrying value of goodwill arising on business combinations at the transition date and 31 December 2004.
Goodwill amortisation charged to the income statement in 2004 of 15.3 million is reversed under IFRS.
Negative goodwill arose on an acquisition prior to the transition date.
The book value of the negative goodwill at 31 December 2003 was 3.9 million, and has been fully released in the transitional balance sheet at 1 January 2004.
Intangible assets IFRS3, IAS38, IFRS1 For business combinations made after the transition date, the Group has applied the criteria set out in IAS38 Intangible Assets in identifying and measuring the value of intangible assets.
Customer contracts to provide bus and rail services have been identified on the 2004 acquisitions of SAF, PEG and Regentalbahn.
The total value of intangible assets purchased on these business combinations was 34.8 million, and is being amortised over the lives of the contracts to which they relate, resulting in a charge in 2004 under IFRS of 1.8 million.
To the extent of the identification of these intangible assets, goodwill previously disclosed on the acquisitions has been adjusted downwards accordingly.
Deferred tax has been provided on the intangible assets arising from the business combinations, resulting in additional goodwill reported of 12.8 million.
This additional goodwill was reduced when the annual impairment test was applied to it, together with an associated release from the deferred tax provision, as the contracts unwound.
In the year ended 31 December 2004 the impairment charged to the income statement was 0.6 million.
As noted earlier, the Group has recognised a pension deficit in respect of the Railways Pension Scheme of 12.0 million at 1 January 2004.
A detailed consultation process has taken place with our peer group in the UK rail industry as to how to recognise such a deficit whilst also reflecting the position where there is no obligation to fund pensions beyond the expiry of the franchise.
The outcome is the recognition of an intangible asset on transition of 12.0 million reflecting the right to operate the Arriva Trains Wales franchise.
The Group has followed the initial recognition criteria of IAS38 which requires the retrospective assessment of the value of the intangible asset as at the date it was created.
The intangible asset is being amortised over the life of the Arriva Trains franchise resulting in a charge of 0.8 million in the year ended 31 December 2004.
Share-based payments IFRS2 IFRS2 Share-Based Payments requires the Group to charge its income statement with the fair value of equity settled share-based payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005.
The Group has used the Black Scholes model to measure the fair value of options granted.
Profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2004 is reduced by 0.2 million.
Joint ventures IAS31 Under IAS31 Interests in Joint Ventures, proportional consolidation is the preferred basis for representing interests, with equity accounting permitted as an alternative.
The Group has used proportional consolidation to account for joint ventures.
This has led to the restatement of 2004 comparatives for SAF and certain other smaller joint venture arrangements.
Whilst there is no impact on net assets or profit before tax, the inclusion of balance sheet items on a line by line basis has reduced net debt by 3.4 million at 31 December 2004, principally representing the cash balances held in SAF.
Proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets IAS16 Under UK GAAP, the reported turnover for the Vehicle Rental and Bus and Coach distribution businesses included proceeds from the disposals of rental fleet held in fixed assets.
IAS16 Property, Plant and Equipment does not permit the recognition of revenue on disposal of non-current assets.
Accordingly, reported revenue for the year ended 31 December 2004 is reduced by 52.0 million.
Financial instruments IAS32, IAS39 The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to foreign exchange translation risk, interest rate exposure and fuel prices.
The Group has opted to take advantage of the exemption in IFRS1 not to prepare comparative information under IAS32 and IAS39.
The date of transition for IAS32 and IAS39 is therefore 1 January 2005, with net assets increasing by 3.7 million, net of deferred tax, reflecting the fair value of the derivatives at that date.
