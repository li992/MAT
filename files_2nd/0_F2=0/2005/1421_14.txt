Pension costs Associated British Foods pension schemes The group operates pension schemes, the majority of which are of the defined benefit type.
The groups principal UK defined benefit schemes are closed to new members, with defined contribution arrangements in place for these members.
The pension costs in the UK for the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
For the defined contribution schemes, the pension costs are the contributions paid.
The last actuarial valuations of the British Sugar Pension Scheme and the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme were carried out as at 1 October 2004 and 5 April 2005 respectively.
Both valuations were carried out using a market related approach, under which the actuarial values of the assets were taken as their market values at the valuation date.
The valuation assumptions also reflected market conditions at the respective valuation date.
For the British Sugar Pension Scheme, it was assumed that the investment return would exceed price inflation by 3.75% per annum, prior to retirement and by 2.0% per annum, post retirement.
Salary increases were assumed to exceed price inflation by 2% per annum in addition to promotional salary increases.
For the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme, the investment return assumption prior to retirement exceeded the price inflation assumption by 2.5% per annum and post retirement by 1.75% per annum.
Salary increases were assumed to exceed price inflation by 1.75% per annum.
Both schemes mortality assumptions were also amended to reflect expected future increases in longevity.
At the valuation dates the total market value of the assets of the British Sugar Pension Scheme and the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme was 1,869m and the value of these assets for actuarial valuation purposes represented 97% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Following the respective valuations, the group has paid additional contributions in addition to regular monthly contributions totalling almost 15m into its UK pension schemes to address the funding deficits.
58 The group also operates defined benefit pension schemes in Australia and New Zealand, the United States, the Republic of Ireland, Switzerland, Norway, Germany, France and the Philippines.
The charge for the year is based on recommendations by qualified local actuaries.
The most recent actuarial valuations referred to above have been updated to 17 September 2005 by an independent qualified actuary.

Pension costs continued The financial assumptions used to calculate UK scheme liabilities under FRS 17 are: 2005 2004 2003 %%% Rate of general increase in salaries 4.50 4.80 4.50 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.50 2.80 2.50 Rate of increase of deferred pensions 2.80 2.80 2.50 Discount rate of scheme liabilities 5.00 5.60 5.25 Inflation 2.80 2.80 2.50 For some of the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions have been used where recommended by local actuaries.
Because the groups principal UK defined benefit schemes are closed to new members, they have an ageing population.
In accordance with FRS 17, the valuation of the schemes liabilities has been determined using the projected unit method.
In these circumstances the use of this method can lead to the contribution rate implicit in the current service cost increasing in future years.

Acquisitions and disposals continued Acquisition of yeast and bakery ingredients group and herbs & spices business The company acquired the Tones herbs & spices business and the yeast and bakery ingredients business from Burns Philp on 3 September and 30 September 2004 respectively.
The Tones acquisition was accounted for in the groups financial statements for the year ended 18 September 2004.
Although the two acquisitions were the subject of separate contracts they were negotiated concurrently and the group has therefore sought to provide the disclosures required by FRS 6 Acquisitions and Mergers for substantial acquisitions in respect of both transactions.
These disclosures are set out below in Australian dollars and in accordance with Australian GAAP.
It has not been practical to provide a statement of total recognised gains and losses.
