Comparative figures for 2004 have been restated to reflect the adoption of UITF38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts.
In 2000, the Group changed its accounting reference date from 30 September to 31 March resulting in an extended accounting period of 18 months to March 2000.
Results presented above are for years to 31 March and have been calculated using the Groups published interim and full year financial statements.
In order to show the underlying trend of dividend payments, dividends shown in the above table have been adjusted as follows: a to exclude from the dividend for the year to March 1997 the Foreign Income Dividend enhancement of 1.325p per share included in the Interim 1997 dividend: and b to exclude from the dividend of 26.9p per share paid in respect of the 18 months to March 2000 the Final Dividend of 9.1p per share paid in respect of the transitional six-month period to March 2000 with the effect that the dividend of 17.8p per share for the year to March 2000 shown above is presented on an annualised basis.
