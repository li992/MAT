23 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates pension plans throughout the world covering the majority of employees.
These plans are devised in accordance with local conditions and practices in the country concerned.
The assets of the Groups plans are generally held in separately administered trusts or are insured.
A provision of 22.0m 2004 : 21.1m is included in provisions for liabilities and charges to cover the excess of the accumulated pension costs 19.4m and other post-retirement benefits 2.6m over the amounts funded.
The total pension cost for the Group was 13.0m 2004 : 13.1m, of which 11.6m relates to plans in the United Kingdom and the United States which cover 71 per cent of employees within schemes.
Included within the total pension cost is 1.0m for defined contribution arrangements in the USA.
An actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2003 by AON Limited, independent consulting actuaries.
The scheme is valued formally every 3 years, the next valuation being as at April 2006.

This method aims for a stable and regular pension cost for current and expected future employees over their anticipated period of employment.
The surplus of assets relative to liabilities is spread over the average expected remaining service lives of current employees, assessed as 13 years, using the level of percentage of salary method.
Other post-retirement benefits of 0.2m were utilised in the year 2004 : 0.2m.
These benefits relate mainly to healthcare and life assurance for beneficiaries in the United States.
The benefits are covered by an unfunded defined benefit scheme and a provision is carried in the balance sheet for the accumulated liabilities.
These were assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice as at 31 March 1997 using the projected unit credit method.
The assumed discount rate was 7.25 per cent p. a. and annual healthcare costs were assumed to increase by 7.0 per cent p. a.
The Group continues to report pension costs in accordance with SSAP24.
However the Group is following the extended transitional arrangements under which additional disclosure on retirement benefits is required in the notes to the financial statements under FRS 17.
The standard requires pension deficits and surpluses, to the extent that these are considered recoverable, to be recognised in full.
Annual service costs and net financial income or expense on the assets and liabilities of the schemes will be recognised through the profit and loss account.
Other fluctuations in the value of the surplus will be recognised in the Statement of Recognised Gains and Losses.
