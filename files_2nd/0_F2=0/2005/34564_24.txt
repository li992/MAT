Notes to the accounts For the year ended 30 December 2005 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK law and accounting standards and, except for the non-depreciation of investment properties referred to below, with the Companies Act 1985.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of properties and investments and the treatment of negative goodwill, using the following principal accounting policies.
These have been applied consistently.
These financial statements have been prepared for the year ended 30 December 2005.
The comparative figures are for the 364 day period ended 30 December 2004.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Capital & Regional plc and its consolidated entities, associated companies and joint ventures for the year ended 30 December 2005.
Where necessary, the financial statements of associated companies and joint ventures are adjusted to conform with the Groups accounting policies.
Subsidiaries have been consolidated under the acquisition method of accounting and the results of companies acquired during the year are included from the date of acquisition.
The Group also acquired the remaining 50% of Morrison Merlin which it did not already own on 4 October 2005.
From this date Morrison Merlin has been treated as a subsidiary and its results have been consolidated, prior to this date the Groups 50% interest had been treated as a joint venture.
The directors have not applied the one-stage method of calculating goodwill required by Schedule 4A paragraph 9 of the Companies Act as they believe this would fail to give a true and fair view.
Using the method required by the Companies Act to calculate goodwill would have the effect that the gain arising on the original 50% interest in Morrison Merlin would become reclassified as negative goodwill, such that negative goodwill would have increased by 9,599,000.
Therefore the directors have calculated goodwill arising from the purchase of the remaining 50% interest in Morrison Merlin, calculated as the difference between the cost of that purchase and the fair value at the date of that purchase of the identified assets and liabilities attributable to the interest purchased.
The calculation related to that purchase is set out in note 19.
Goodwill Goodwill, being the difference between the cost of businesses acquired and the fair value of their separate net assets, is included in the balance sheet as an intangible asset and is amortised over its useful economic life.
Goodwill is amortised over 12.5 years, on a straight-line basis.
Negative goodwill is similarly included in the balance sheet and will be credited to the profit and loss account in the period in which the acquired nonmonetary assets are recovered through sale.
Joint ventures and associates In accordance with FRS 9, Associates and joint ventures, joint ventures are included in the accounts under the gross equity method of accounting, and associates under the net equity method.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at the lower of cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other than investment properties and land, over their expected useful lives: Long leasehold land and buildings over 50 years, on a straight-line basis.
Fixtures and fittings over three to five years, on a straight-line basis.
Motor vehicles over four years, on a straight-line basis.
Investment properties Investment properties are included in the financial statements at valuation less any unamortised tenant incentives.
The aggregate surplus or temporary deficit below cost arising from such valuations is transferred to a revaluation reserve.
Deficits that are expected to be permanent are charged to the profit and loss account.
The Groups policy is to value investment properties twice a year.
On realisation any gain or loss is calculated by reference to the carrying value at the last financial year end balance sheet date and is included in the profit and loss account.
Any balance in the revaluation reserve is transferred to the profit and loss reserve.
In accordance with SSAP 19, Accounting for investment properties no depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties and leasehold investment properties with over 20 years unexpired.
The Companies Act 1985 requires all properties to be depreciated, but that requirement conflicts with the generally accepted principle set out in SSAP 19.
Depreciation is only one of many factors reflected in the annual valuation of properties and the amount of depreciation or amortisation, which might otherwise have been charged, cannot be separately identified or quantified.
Owner-occupied long-leasehold properties Owner-occupied long-leasehold properties are included in the financial statements at valuation less any unamortised tenant incentives.
The Groups policy is to value owner-occupied long-leasehold properties twice a year.
Capital & Regional 49 Notes to the accounts continued For the year ended 30 December 2005 1 Accounting policies continued Properties under development Interest and directly attributable internal and external costs incurred during the period of development are capitalised.
Interest is capitalised gross before deduction of related tax relief.
Interest is calculated on the development expenditure by reference to specific borrowings where relevant.
A property ceases to be treated as being under development when substantially all activities that are necessary to get the property ready for use are complete.
Refurbishment expenditure Refurbishment expenditure in respect of major works is capitalised.
Renovation and refurbishment expenditure of a revenue nature is expensed as incurred.
Property transactions Acquisitions and disposals are accounted for at the date of legal completion.
Properties are transferred between categories at the estimated market value on the transfer date.
Current property assets Properties held with the intention of disposal and properties held for development are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Tenant incentives Lease incentives which enhance the property are added to the cost of properties.
Where a lease incentive does not enhance the property they are held as a debtor on the balance sheet and are amortised over the period to the earlier of the first rent review, the first break option, or the end of the lease term.
On new leases with rent-free periods, rental income is allocated evenly over the period from the date of the lease commencement to the date of the first rent review.
Loan arrangement costs Costs relating to the raising of general corporate loan facilities and loan stock are amortised over the estimated life of the loan and charged to the profit and loss account as part of the interest expense.
The bank loans and loan stock are disclosed net of unamortised loan issue costs.
Operating leases Annual rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Current taxation Current taxation is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in accordance with FRS 19, Deferred tax, on all timing differences which have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
On disposal of a property, any provision for deferred tax no longer required will be released to the profit and loss account.
Deferred tax is not provided on revaluation gains unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the assets, and the gain or loss arising on sale has been recognised in the financial statements.
Pension costs Pension liabilities, all of which relate to defined contribution schemes, are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they accrue.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP For share schemes that contingently award shares at no cost to the participant, a charge is recognised systematically in the profit and loss account over the LTIP performance period based on the directors estimate of the extent that the related performance criteria will be met, with a corresponding credit in the profit and loss reserve.
Own shares In accordance with UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP trusts own shares held by the Group are shown as a deduction from shareholders funds, and included in other reserves.
The cost of own shares is transferred from other reserves to the profit and loss reserve systematically over the LTIP performance period.
The shares are held in an Employee Share Ownership Trust.
Performance fees Performance fees are recognised in line with the property management contracts.
The 2005 performance fee is paid on 1 December 2006, but relates to outperformance during the three-year period ended on 31 December 2005.
Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date and, unless they relate to the hedging of the net investment in foreign operations, differences arising on translation are recognised in the profit and loss account.
50 Capital & Regional 1 Accounting policies continued Foreign currency continued The result of overseas operations are translated at the closing rates of exchange during the year and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they hedge on the Groups investment in such operations, are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account.
The origin and destination of turnover is not materially different.
