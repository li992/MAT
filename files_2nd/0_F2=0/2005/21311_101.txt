53 Share-based payments The Group operates share schemes for employees throughout the world.
The main current schemes are: Sharesave Eligible employees in the UK may participate in the Barclays Sharesave Scheme.
Under this Scheme, employees may enter into contracts to save up to 250 per month and, at the expiry of a fixed term of three, five or seven years, have the option to use these savings to acquire shares in the Company at a discount, calculated in accordance with the rules of the Scheme.
The discount is currently 20% of the market price at the date the options are granted.
Participants in the Scheme have six months from the date of vest in which the option can be exercised.
Sharepurchase Sharepurchase was introduced in January 2002.
It is an Inland Revenue approved all-employee share plan.
The plan is open to all eligible UK employees, including executive Directors.
Under the plan, participants are able to purchase up to 1,500 worth of Barclays PLC ordinary shares per tax year, which, if kept in trust for five years, can be withdrawn from the plan tax-free.
Matching shares were introduced to the Scheme during 2005 where the purchase of Barclays shares by the participant are matched equally by the Company up to a value of 600 per tax year.
Any shares in the plan will earn dividends in the form of additional shares, which must normally be held by the trustee for three years before being eligible for release.
Executive Share Award Scheme ESAS For certain employees of the Group an element of their annual bonus is in the form of a deferred award of a provisional allocation of Barclays PLC shares under ESAS.
The total value of the bonus made to the employee of which ESAS is an element is dependent upon the business unit, Group and individual employee performance.
The ESAS element of the annual bonus must be held for at least three years and is subject to potential forfeit if the individual resigns and commences work with a competitor business.
Performance Share Plan PSP The Performance Share Plan PSP was approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM to replace the ISOP scheme.
Performance shares are free Barclays shares for which no exercise price is payable and which qualify for dividends.
Performance share awards are communicated to participants as an initial allocation.
Barclays performance over a three-year period determines the final number of shares that may be released to participants.
Incentive Share Option Plan ISOP The ISOP is open by invitation to the employees and Directors of Barclays PLC.
Options are granted at the market price at the date of grant calculated in accordance with the rules of the Plan, and are normally exercisable between three and ten years from that date.
The final number of shares over which the option may be exercised is determined by reference to set performance criteria.
The number of shares under option represents the maximum possible number that may be exercised.
Barclays Global Investors Equity Ownership Plan BGI EOP The BGI Equity Ownership Plan is extended to senior employees of BGI.
The exercise price of the options is determined by the Remuneration Committee of Barclays PLC based on the fair value of BGI as determined by an independent appraiser.
The options are granted over shares in Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Limited, a subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC.
Options are normally not exercisable until vesting, with a third of the options held becoming exercisable at each anniversary of grant.
Options lapse ten years after grant.
Absa Group Limited Share Incentive Trust AGLSIT In terms of the rules of Absa Group Limited Share Incentive Trust the maximum number of shares which may be issued or transferred and or in respect of which options may be granted to the participants shall be limited to shares representing 10% of the total number of issued shares.
Options are allocated to Absa employees according to the normal Human Resources talent management process.
The options issued up to August 2005 had no performance criteria linked to them and vested in equal tranches after three, four and five years respectively.
No dividends accrue to the option holder over the period.
The options expire after a period of ten years from the issuing date.
Options issued since August 2005 have vesting performance criteria associated with them, which require headline earnings per share to exceed an agreed benchmark over a three-year period from July 2005 for the options to vest.
Absa Group Limited Share Ownership Trust AGLSOT AGLSOT enabled all Absa employees to participate in a one-off offer to purchase 200 redeemable cumulative option-holding preference shares.
Options vest after three years and lapse after five years from the date of issue.
Exercise may occur in lots of 100 only and within a price range varying from R48 to R69 4.41-6.35 dependent on the 30-day volume weighted trading price on the JSE Limited.
Options are redeemed by Absa on the final exercise date.
Absa Group Limited Black Economic Empowerment BEE Scheme On 25th June 2004, Absa shareholders approved the allocation of 73,152,300, redeemable cumulative option-holding Absa preference shares to Batho Bonke Capital Limited.
The shares carry the same rights as ordinary shares including voting rights, and receive dividends which are payable semi-annually.
3.5 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2005 211 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31st December 2005 53 Share-based payments continued In addition, options remain outstanding under the following closed schemes: Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS is a long-term incentive scheme and was available by invitation to certain senior executives of the Group with grants usually made annually.
Options were issued at the market price at the date of the grant without any discount, calculated in accordance with the rules of the Scheme, and are normally exercisable between three and ten years from that date.
No further awards are made under ESOS.
Woolwich Executive Share Option Plan Woolwich ESOP Options originally granted over Woolwich PLC shares at market value were exercised in 2001 or exchanged, in accordance with the proposals made under the offer to acquire the Woolwich, for options over Barclays PLC shares.
Under the rules of ESOP, the performance conditions attached to the exercise of options were disapplied on acquisition of Woolwich PLC by Barclays.
Woolwich Save As You Earn Scheme Woolwich SAYE Under this Scheme, employees entered into contracts to save up to 250 per month and, at the expiry of a fixed term of three, five or seven years, have the option to use these savings to acquire the shares in the Company at a discount calculated in accordance with the rules of the Scheme.
The discount was 20% of the market price at the date the options were granted.
The weighted average fair value per option granted during the year is as follows: 2005 2004 Sharesave 1.29 1.48 Sharepurchase 5.57 ESAS 5.03 4.45 PSP 3.99 ISOP 2.78 2.49 BGI EOP 10.41 5.59 AGLSIT 10.13 Fair values for Sharesave, PSP, ISOP, BGI EOP and AGLSIT are calculated at the date of grant using either a Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo model.
Sharepurchase and ESAS are nil cost awards on which the performance conditions are substantially completed at the date of grant.
Consequently the fair value of these awards is based on the market value at that date.
The significant weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the options granted in 2005 are as follows: 2005 Sharesave PSP ISOP BGI EOP AGLSIT Weighted average share price 5.71 5.33 5.73 39.09 8.25 Exercise price 4.44 n a 5.66 39.09 8.41 Expected volatility 24% 20% 34% 25% n a Option life 4 years 3 years 5 years 4 years 5-8 years Implied volatility and dividend yield on the date of grant has been used as inputs into the respective valuation models for Sharesave, PSP and ISOP.
Expected volatility has been determined using historical volatility over the last three years for BGI EOP and AGLSIT applies a five-year rolling period eight years for Executive members.
BBA Libor interest rate curve has been used to derive a risk-free discount rate for all schemes other than BGI EOP and AGLSIT.
The risk-free interest rate for BGI EOP uses the US Treasury rate corresponding to the expected option life at the date of grant.
The risk-free rate on the AGLSIT represents the yield, recorded on date of option grant, on South African government zero coupon bond of a term equal to the expected life of the option.
For the purposes of determining the expected life and number of options to vest, historical exercise patterns have been used, together with an assumption that a certain percentage of options will lapse due to leavers.
The expected dividends for all schemes are assumed to grow in line with the expected increases in share prices for the industry sector until exercise.
