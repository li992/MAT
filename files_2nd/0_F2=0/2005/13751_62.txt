Notes to the consolidated financial statements 33.
Contingent liabilities continued Staff loans and pension guarantees above primarily relate to the present value of Miller pension guarantees.
Miller and Pabst Brewing Company Pabst are responsible for the Milwaukee Brewery Workers Pension Plan.
In connection with Pabsts closure of its Milwaukee, Wisconsin brewery and their contract brewing agreement with Miller, Pabst entered into a withdrawal liability settlement agreement, which requires annual payments by Pabst to this pension plan of approximately US$4 million until 2013.
In the event that Pabst is unable to full its pension plan obligation, the plan would have recourse to all the assets of Pabst and its parent company.
If such assets do not satisfy Pabsts remaining pension obligation, Miller would be required to fund the remaining Pabst withdrawal liability until 2013.
SABMiller and Altria entered into a tax matters agreement the Agreement on 30 May 2002, to regulate the conduct of tax matters between them with regard to the acquisition of Miller and to allocate responsibility for contingent tax costs.
SABMiller has agreed to indemnify Altria against any taxes, losses, liabilities and costs that Altria incurs arising out of or in connection with a breach by SABMiller of any representation, agreement or covenant in the Agreement, subject to certain exceptions.
The group has exposures to various environmental risks.
Although it is difficult to predict the groups liability with respect to these risks, future payments, if any, would be made over a period of time in amounts that would not be material to the groups financial position, except insofar as already provided in the consolidated financial statements.
The group has a number of activities in a wide variety of geographic areas and is subject to certain legal claims incidental to its operations.
In the opinion of the directors, after taking appropriate legal advice, these claims are not expected to have, either individually or in aggregate, a material adverse effect upon the groups financial position, except insofar as already provided in the consolidated financial statements.
The company, with Miller Brewing Company, in common with other participants in the beer and spirits industries in the USA, is a co-defendant in a rising number of putative class action lawsuits alleging that the defendants have intentionally targeted the marketing of certain alcoholic beverage brands to persons under the legal drinking age.
The plaintiffs allege several causes of action, including violations of state consumer protection laws, unjust enrichment, negligence and civil conspiracy.
The complaints seek, on behalf of undefined classes of parents and guardians, an injunction and unspecified money damages including fines, punitive damages and disgorgement of profits relating to underage consumption.
The lawsuits are in pleading stages and, with one exception, defendants motions to dismiss the complaints are pending or shortly to be led.
In the case that is the exception, the defendants motions to dismiss have been upheld by the court and the plaintiffs are appealing this decision.
Currently, the defendants are presenting their preliminary legal defences and strenuously defending the lawsuits.
As these are relatively new developments, there are not yet meaningful bases on which the potential for liability and any quantum of penalty or damages can be determined.
The group has not provided for deferred UK income and foreign withholding taxes relating to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiary undertakings, as remittance of these earnings is not currently anticipated in the foreseeable future.
Pensions and post-retirement benets The group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
These schemes have been designed and are administered in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries concerned and include both dened contribution and dened benefit schemes.
The majority of the schemes are funded and the schemes assets are held independently of the groups nances.
Pension and post-retirement benefit costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualied actuaries.
Generally, the projected unit method is applied to measure the dened benefit scheme liabilities.
The group also provides medical benets, which are mainly unfunded, for retired employees and their dependants in South Africa.
The main assumptions used in calculating the costs were an annual discount rate of 11%, consumer ination of 7% and medical cost ination of 9%.
The last valuation was performed on 31 March 2003.
Miller provides post-retirement, medical and life insurance benets, which are unfunded, to eligible employees and their dependants.
Obligations for post-retirement medical benefit plans were US$346 million at 31 March 2003, the date of the most recent valuation.
The principal assumptions used in calculating the liabilities were an annual discount rate of 8%, consumer ination of 2.75% and medical cost ination of 10%.
The pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs for the years ended 31 March 2005 and 31 March 2004 are as follows: 2005 2004 US$m US$m Dened contribution scheme costs 56 44 Dened benefit scheme costs 13 51 Post-retirement medical benets costs 51 42 Pension accruals 50 42 Provisions for pensions 46 134 Provisions for post-retirement benets 433 404 The group operates various dened contribution and dened benefit schemes.

Pensions and post-retirement benets continued The South African Breweries Staff Provident Fund During the financial year ended 31 March 1998 the South African Breweries Pension Fund was liquidated.
Members of this fund were converted from a dened benefit basis to a dened contribution basis and transferred to the South African Breweries Staff Provident Fund.
On transfer to the Provident Fund, members received an enhancement of 27% of their actuarial reserve value.
The market value of assets as at 1 December 1997 was US$288 million.
The liquidation of the pension fund was approved by the Financial Services Board of South Africa and the transfer of assets was substantially completed on 31 July 1998.
At the liquidation date an actuarial valuation of the pension fund indicated an estimated surplus to the employer of approximately US$55 million.
The main assumptions used in the calculation of the dened benefit liabilities and to calculate the variation cost in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for pensions costs were a long-term investment return of 15% per annum and a real return in excess of salary ination of approximately 1% per annum on average.
The level of funding, being the actuarial value of assets expressed as a percentage of the accrued service liabilities, calculated at the liquidation date, was approximately 128%.
The surplus has been transferred to the Staff Provident Fund and is held separately from members assets as an employer reserve.
In terms of the rules of the fund, this employer reserve was being used to fund a contribution holiday, the benefit of which, in accordance with SSAP 24, was being spread over the period of the average future working lives of the employees, estimated to be 10 years.
During the year ended 31 March 2005, the contribution holiday ceased.
Also during the year ended 31 March 2005, notication was received from the Financial Services Board that the remaining surplus on liquidation after distributions to employees belongs to the employer.
The accrued liability is thus being reversed, in accordance with SSAP 24, over the average future working lives of the employees, estimated to be 10 years.
Details of the major dened benefit schemes are provided below: The ABI Pension Fund The latest valuation of the ABI Pension Fund was carried out at 1 January 2001 by an independent actuary using the attained age method.
The main assumptions were price ination of 8% per annum, a long-term investment return of 12.5% per annum, rate of salary ination of 10% per annum and pension ination of 8% per annum.
The latest actuarial valuation revealed a surplus of US$18 million in the actuarial value of the assets of US$51 million compared to the actuarial value of the liabilities.
This represents a funding level of 154%.
The market value of assets at 1 January 2001 was US$60 million.
Miller pension schemes Salaried employees substantially all salaried employees of Miller are covered by a dened benefit pension plan, a survivor income benefit plan and a long-term disability plan.
Previously the salaried employees of Miller Brewing Company participated in the salaried employees pension scheme of Altria.
On 9 July 2002, Miller Brewing Company established its own pension scheme for salaried employees.
During the year ended 31 March 2005 the Internal Revenue Service approved the Miller plan as a qualied pension plan and assets from the Altria plan were transferred to the Miller plan.
As of 9 July 2002, the salaried employee pension plan had a deficit of US$36 million in the actuarial value of the plan assets of US$364 million compared to the actuarial value of the liabilities.
This represents a funding level of 91%.
Hourly employees eligible hourly employees participate in stand-alone pension plans providing at dollar benets based on years of service.
The most recent actuarial valuations of these plans, and of Millers post-retirement benefit plans, were carried out by professionally qualied actuaries at 1 January 2003 using the projected unit method.
The principal assumptions used in the preparation of the pension valuations were an annual discount rate of 8%, a rate of increase in at dollar benets of 2% and consumer ination of 2.75%.
The latest actuarial valuation revealed a deficit of US$5 million in the actuarial value of the assets of US$180 million compared to the actuarial value of the liabilities.
This represents a funding level of 97%.
During the year changes were made to certain of the Miller pension schemes intended to limit the impact on future costs including the closure of certain schemes to new members.
This has led to a past service credit which is being recognised over the average future working lives of the employees.
Certain of Millers hourly employees participate in the Milwaukee Brewery Workers Pension Plan.
As part of the withdrawal settlement, Pabst, which had participated in the plan prior to 1997, has agreed to make annual contributions of approximately US$4 million to this plan until 2013.
The plans funded status net of the present value of Pabsts withdrawal payments at 31 March 2005 is set out below: US$m Market value of assets 39 Present value of accrued obligations, net of Pabst withdrawal payments 73 deficit 34 Additional disclosures required under Financial Reporting Standard FRS 17 In November 2000, the Accounting Standards Board issued FRS 17 Retirement Benets which changes the way in which companies are required to measure, recognise and disclose their obligations for pension and post-retirement benets, and the related amounts charged to the profit and loss account and statement of recognised gains and losses.
SABMiller has chosen not to early adopt this FRS, but in line with the transitional provisions of this standard, the additional disclosures as at 31 March 2005, and for the year then ended, are set out overleaf.
