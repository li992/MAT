NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2005 1.
Basis of preparation The separate financial statements of the company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
In preparing the financial statements for the current year, the company has adopted FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date, FRS 23 The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and Disclosure, and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Adoption of FRS 21 means that proposed dividends that are not declared before the balance sheet date cannot be accrued as a liability at the year-end.
The 2004 comparative numbers have been restated to reflect the change in accounting policy due to the adoption of FRS 21.
The impact of adopting FRS 21 at 31 December 2004 is to increase shareholders funds by 28.1 million.
The main impact of the adoption of FRS 25 and 26 is to recognise the embedded derivative within the convertible bond on transition to these standards at 1 January 2005.
The embedded derivative within the convertible bond is required to be at fair value on transition, and subsequent movements in fair value are recognised through the income statement.
Significant accounting policies Investments Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost or nominal value of shares issued where merger relief is taken, less any provision for impairment.
Where the recoverable amount of the investment is less than the carrying amount, an impairment is recognised.
Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of the balance sheet.
Exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments Financial instruments in the scope of FRS 26 are classified as either financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, and in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, after taking account of directly attributable transaction costs.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the following exceptions: provision is made for taxable gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold: provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable: and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period on which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Cash flow statement The company has utilised the exemptions provided under FRS 1 Revised and has not presented a cash flow statement.
The cash flow statement has been prepared in the group financial statements.
Related party transactions In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard Number 8: Related Party Disclosures, the company is exempt from disclosing transactions with entities that are part of the UBM group, or investees of the group qualifying as related parties, as it is a parent publishing consolidated financial statements.
