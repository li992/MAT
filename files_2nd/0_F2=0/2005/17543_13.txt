YELL GROUP PLC If the average exchange rate of the US dollar as measured against the pound sterling had been 10% higher or lower, with no change in variable rates of interest, then the interest payable in the 2005 financial year would have been approximately 3.8 million lower or 4.6 million higher, respectively.
Our exposure to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the amount of variable-rate indebtedness that we have outstanding and the extent of any hedging arrangements that we put in place.
Similarly, our exposure to currency fluctuations will depend on the mix of US dollar and pounds sterling-denominated indebtedness and the extent of any hedging arrangements.
Further information on financial instruments and our risk management is discussed in note 17 of the notes to the financial statements.
Significant Differences between UK and US GAAP Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, which differ in certain respects from US GAAP.
Differences result primarily from acquisition accounting, which affects the accounting for directories in progress, goodwill and other intangibles, and taxation.
Timing differences also arise when recognising certain costs associated with directories in progress, interest that is fixed by derivative financial instruments, and deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses in the US.
Differences in accounting for pensions arise from the requirements to use different actuarial methods and assumptions.
Under UK GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in respect of which they are declared in the case of interim or any special dividends or proposed by the Board to the shareholders in the case of final dividends.
Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in which dividends are declared.
See note 28 of the notes to the financial statements on differences between US GAAP and UK GAAP.
Recent US GAAP Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123R, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123R.
This statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services.
This statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
We believe that we already comply with this requirement and do not expect adoption of this revision to the standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
International Financial Reporting Standards In June 2002, the Council of Ministers of the European Union approved a regulation the Regulation requiring all companies that are governed by the law of a Member State of the European Union and whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market of any Member State to prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Regulation is effective for each financial year starting on or after 1 January 2005.
Accordingly, we have adopted IFRS from 1 April 2005.
Our first results under IFRS will be for the three months ending 30 June 2005.
The date of transition to IFRS is 1 April 2004.
We have published separately from this report 2005 conversion statements that set out the effects of the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS on our balance sheet at the date of transition and on the quarterly results since transition.
These statements have been prepared on the basis of our best knowledge of what IFRS may require at 31 March 2006.
The current standards are subject to ongoing review and interpretation.
There is a possibility that IFRS at 31 March 2006 will be different from what we currently expect.
Therefore, the financial information for the 2005 financial year that we publish in our audited accounts for the year ending 31 March 2006 may be different from that published in our conversion statements.
The conversion statements include the three months ended 30 June 2004, six months ended 30 September 2004, the nine months ended 31 December 2004 and the year ended 31 March 2005.
These statements have been prepared on the basis of IFRS expected to be available at 31 March 2006.
These are subject to ongoing review and endorsement by the EU or possible amendment and are, therefore, still subject to change.
We have included our accounting policies as revised under IFRS in the conversion statements.
The primary changes to our published results arise from: Discontinuing goodwill amortisation unless the value of goodwill is impaired Accounting for pensions on a basis similar to what would have been required under FRS17 as described in Note 24 to the financial statements in this annual report Including in employee costs the fair value of equity instruments granted to employees Increasing the tax charge to remove certain benefits recognised under UK GAAP Our unaudited adjusted EBITDA under IFRS for the year ended 31 March 2005 is 2.4% lower than under UK GAAP at 393.0 million.
Unaudited profit before tax is 234.4 million and profit after tax is 162.5 million, 52.5% and 72.5% higher, respectively, primarily due to discontinuing goodwill amortisation.
The adjustments do not affect the reported cash flows from operations.
Addititonal information regarding the effects of IFRS on our 2005 results is provided in our conversion statements, which are on our website www.
54 ANNUAL REPORT 2004 05 UK Regulation In August 2004 the Office of Fair Trading OFT announced a review of Yell UKs undertakings in respect of our Yellow Pages directories.
In November 2004 the OFT announced this review would take the form of a market study under the terms of the Enterprise Act.
At the conclusion of their study in April 2005, the OFT referred what it defined as classified directory advertising services to the Competition Commission for investigation.
In the ten years since the Monopolies and Mergers Commission completed its first review, the classified advertising market has become increasingly dynamic and aggressively competitive.
Recently there have been a number of new entrants into the market.
These include printed directories from BT and Trinity Mirror, more than 80 phone-based services and numerous online services.
We believe that this has served advertisers and users well, and that the market is still evolving.
The Commissions administrative timetable allows for the publication of its final report by the end of June 2006.
It is not bound in the remedies it can apply and therefore a wide range of outcomes is possible.
We are committed to playing a proactive role in the investigation.
Our internal team is supported by appropriate external advisers to ensure that our arguments are properly supported and heard.
Critical Accounting Estimates In general, our accounting policies under UK GAAP are consistent with those generally adopted by others operating within the same industry in the UK.
Our accounting policies are summarised in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, our management has made its best estimates and judgements of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality.
We regularly review these estimates and update them when required.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Unless otherwise indicated, we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below.
We consider the following to be a description of the most significant estimates, which require our management to make subjective and complex judgements, or matters that are inherently uncertain.
Allowance for doubtful debts Debtors are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectable in the future.
We continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified.
We have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience.
Whilst such bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past.
If our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of turnover had been 1.0% higher or lower during the year ended 31 March 2005, then profit before tax would have varied by approximately 13 million.
Goodwill and tangible fixed assets Goodwill and tangible fixed assets are long-lived assets that are amortised over their useful lives.
Useful lives are based on managements estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue.
If the useful economic lives had increased or decreased by an average of one year during the year ended 31 March 2005, then our amortisation charge would have varied by approximately 5 million.
Our depreciation charge would have varied by approximately 6 million if the useful lives had increased by an average of one year, or by approximately 13 million if the useful lives had decreased by an average of one year.
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable and at the end of the first full year following acquisition.
Historically, we have not realised large gains or losses on disposals of fixed assets.
Pensions The determination of our obligation and expense for pensions is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts.
Those assumptions are described in note 24 of the notes to the financial statements and include, amongst others, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation.
Whilst we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect the amount of our future pension obligations, future valuation adjustments in the statement of total recognised gains and losses and our future employee expenses.
Taxes The determination of our obligation and expense for taxes requires an interpretation of tax law.
We seek appropriate competent and professional tax advice before making any judgements on tax matters.
Whilst we believe that our judgements are prudent and appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience may materially affect our future tax charges.
We recognise deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences where we have a taxable benefit or obligation in the future as a result of past events.
We record deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe they are more likely than not to be realised.
Should we determine that we would be able to realise our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made.
In the year ended 31 March 2005, we increased our net profit for the year by 5.8 million when we recognised previously unrecognised deferred tax assets that we believe we will realise in the near future.
At 31 March 2005 we have recognised all our potential deferred tax assets.
Lawsuit Costs The determination of our obligation and expense for the exceptional lawsuits are based on managements best estimates after taking into consideration appropriate advice from legal experts.
55 YELL GROUP PLC Current Trading and Prospects Since 31 March 2005, trading has been in line with our expectations.
We have put in place substantial groundwork to ensure that our growth continues in the current financial year.
Our strong cash generation should allow us to continue to finance acquisitions in the US and grow dividends in line with earnings.
Dividend Policy The total dividend for the year ended 31 March 2005 will be 88.3 million.
An interim dividend of 4.2 pence per share was paid on 17 December 2004 to shareholders registered on 19 November 2004, and a final dividend of 8.4 pence per share will be paid on 19 August 2005 to shareholders registered on 22 July 2005 subject to approval by the shareholders of the company.
Statement of Directors Responsibilities Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements the directors are required to: Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements Prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the financial information, including the Annual Report, on the Yell Group plc website www.
Legislation in the UK concerning the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
56 ANNUAL REPORT 2004 05 Auditors Report Yell Group plc Independent Auditors Report to the Members of Yell Group plc We have audited the financial statements which comprise the consolidated profit and loss account, the balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses and the related notes.
We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 contained in the directors remuneration report the auditable part.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors The directors responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors responsibilities.
The directors are also responsible for preparing the directors remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors remuneration report in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and UK Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Companys members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors remuneration report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
The other information comprises only the chairmans statement, the chief executive officers review, the chief financial officers review, the operating and financial review, the governance and responsibility statements, the five year financial summary and the two year operational summary.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Companys compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the Boards statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Groups corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Basis of Audit Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors remuneration report.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Companys circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors remuneration report are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 31 March 2005 and of the profit and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 those parts of the directors remuneration report required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985  LLP Chartered Accountants and Registered Auditors London 6 June 2005 57 YELL GROUP PLC Consolidated Profit and Loss Account Year ended 31 March Continuing Operations Notes 2004 2005 m m Turnover 2 1,186.9 1,285.3 Cost of sales 552.9 592.3 Gross profit 634.0 693.0 Distribution costs 34.5 38.3 Administrative expenses Ongoing activities 359.0 373.5 Exceptional items 3 90.1 36.5 449.1 410.0 Operating profit 4 150.4 244.7 Net interest payable Ongoing activities 136.1 91.0 Exceptional items 3 58.4 6 194.5 91.0 Loss profit on ordinary activities before taxation 44.1 153.7 Tax credit charge on loss profit on ordinary activities Before exceptional items 44.2 73.2 On exceptional items 3 37.2 13.7 Taxation 7 7.0 59.5 Loss profit on ordinary activities after taxation 51.1 94.2 Dividends 8 62.8 88.3 Loss profit for the financial year 113.9 5.9 Earnings loss per share Basic loss earnings per share 9 8.9 p 13.4p Diluted loss earnings per share 9 8.9 p 13.3p a Earnings per share before exceptional items and amortisation Basic 9 25.6p 30.8p Diluted 9 25.3p 30.4p a Earnings per share before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation for the year ended 31 March 2004 has been adjusted as though our initial public offering and debt refinancing had occurred and non-recurring restructuring costs had been incurred before 31 March 2003.

Basis of Preparation, Consolidation and Accounting Policies Basis of Preparation and Consolidation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the UK and the Companies Act 1985.
These differ significantly to those in the US and a reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles in the US US GAAP is provided in note 29.
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies, which have been consistently applied, is set out below.
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all subsidiaries for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Where the financial statements of subsidiary undertakings do not conform with the Yell Groups accounting policies, appropriate adjustments are made on consolidation in order to present the Yell Group consolidated financial statements on a consistent basis.
All companies within the Yell Group during the period of ownership have coterminous financial years.
All transactions between the Yell Groups businesses have been eliminated in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.
The results of companies and businesses acquired during the period are included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
Intra-group transactions, which have been eliminated on consolidation of the Group, have not been disclosed, as permitted by FRS 8: Related Party Disclosures.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenditure during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates are used principally when accounting for provision for doubtful debts, amortisation of goodwill, depreciation, employee pension, lawsuit costs and taxes.
Brief details of principal subsidiary undertakings at each year end, all of which are unlisted, are shown in note 12 to the financial statements.
Accounting Policies a Turnover Group turnover, after deduction of sales allowances, value added tax and other sales taxes, comprises the value of products provided by Group undertakings.
Turnover from classified directories, Business Pages and other directories, mainly comprising advertising revenue, is recognised in the profit and loss account upon completion of delivery to the users of the directories.
Other turnover, principally from Yellow Pages 118 24 7 and Yell.
com, is recognised from the point at which service is first provided over the life of the contract.
b Cost of sales Cost of sales are the costs incurred in producing directories and other Group products, including costs of the sales force and certain sales overheads dedicated to the sale of advertising.
Charges for doubtful debts are also included within cost of sales and are charged to the profit and loss account as a percentage of turnover based upon the actual bad debt experience as a proportion of total billings.
c Advertising The Group expenses the costs of advertising its own products and services as the costs are incurred.
d Interest Interest payable is charged as incurred on an accruals basis.
e Foreign currencies On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign undertakings are translated into sterling at year-end exchange rates.
The results of foreign undertakings are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange for the period.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation at period-end exchange rates of the net investment in foreign undertakings, less exchange differences on borrowings that finance or provide a hedge against those undertakings, are taken through the statement of total recognised gains and losses to reserves and are also disclosed in note 20.
All other exchange gains or losses are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
61 YELL GROUP PLC f Intangible fixed assets Goodwill arising from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is amortised on a straight-line basis from the time of the acquisition over its estimated useful economic life.
Estimated useful life is determined after taking into account such factors as the nature and age of the business, as well as the typical life span of the acquired products to which the goodwill attaches.
Goodwill in respect of all acquired businesses is amortised over 20 years.
g Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less depreciation.
Cost comprises the purchase price and any other costs of bringing an asset into use.
Depreciation is provided on tangible fixed assets on a straight-line basis from the time they are available for use, so as to write off their costs over their estimated useful economic lives taking into account any expected residual values.
The lives assigned to tangible fixed assets are: Buildings 40 years Leasehold improvements 5 years or life of lease if less than 5 years Office equipment 26 years h Asset impairment Intangible and tangible fixed assets are tested for impairment when an event that might affect asset values has occurred.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount cannot be recovered either by selling the asset or by the discounted future earnings from operating the assets.
Goodwill is subject to an impairment review at the end of the first full year following an acquisition and at any other time when the directors believe that an impairment may have occurred.
i Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings in the financial statements of the Company are carried at Directors valuation and are valued at least once every three years, but earlier if significant acquisitions have taken place.
A deficit on revaluation is charged to the profit and loss account to the extent that it is not covered by a surplus previously credited to the revaluation reserve.
j Leased assets Rentals in respect of operating leases, under which substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor, are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Assets held under finance leases where substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership are transferred to the Group are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and depreciated over their useful economic lives.
The capital element of the future obligations under the leases is included as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets, classified as appropriate as a creditor due within or after one year.
Lease payments are split between capital and interest elements using the annuity method and the interest is then charged to the profit and loss account.
k Stocks Stocks, primarily directories in progress, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Directories in progress mainly comprise sales force costs, artwork and other directory production costs, including appropriate direct overheads, pending completion of delivery of the relevant directories.
Other stock represents paper stock held by the US business.
62 ANNUAL REPORT 2004 05 l Pension schemes The Group currently operates a defined benefit pension scheme for its UK employees employed before 1 October 2001 and operates defined contribution pension schemes for its UK employees employed subsequent to 1 October 2001 and its US employees.
All pension schemes are independent of the Groups finances.
Actuarial valuations of the defined benefit scheme are carried out as determined by the trustees at intervals of not more than three years, the rates of contribution payable and the pension cost being determined on the advice of the actuaries, having regard to the results of these valuations.
In any intervening years, the actuaries review the continuing appropriateness of the contribution rates.
The cost of providing pensions is charged against profits over employees working lives with the Group using the projected unit method.
Payments to the Groups defined contribution schemes are charged against profit as incurred.
The transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements with the relevant disclosures shown in note 24. m Employee share schemes The cost of employee share options, except for options in Inland Revenue approved ShareSave schemes, is measured at the intrinsic value of the options granted on the date of grant and is charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period.
The Group takes advantage of available exemptions in respect of accounting for discounts arising on the grant of options in Inland Revenue approved Sharesave schemes.
When the ESOP trust acquires and holds shares of the Company, the Group presents them as a deduction in arriving at equity shareholders funds.
n Taxation The charge credit for taxation is based on the profit loss for the period and takes into account deferred taxation.
Provision is made in full for deferred tax liabilities that arise from timing differences where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future have occurred by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as more likely than not to be recoverable.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
o Financial instruments All borrowings are initially stated at the fair value of consideration received after deduction of issue costs.
Issue costs are charged to the profit and loss account together with the coupon, as finance costs, on a constant-yield basis over the term of the borrowings, or over a shorter period where the lender can require earlier repayment.
The Group considers its derivative financial instruments to be hedges when certain criteria are met.
For interest rate derivatives, the instrument must be related to assets or liabilities or a probable commitment and must also change the interest rate or the nature of the interest rate by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa.
Interest differentials under interest rate swap agreements are recognised by adjustment of interest payable.
See note 17 for further details on the Groups financial instruments.
p Dividends Dividends are recorded in the period in respect of which they are declared.
Segmental Analysis The Group is a publisher of classified advertising directories in the UK and the US.
Turnover is principally derived from the sale of advertising in such publications.
The geographical analysis is stated on the basis of origin of operations, although it would not be different had it been stated on the basis of customer origin.
The segmental information is based on the segmental operating results regularly reviewed by the Groups chief operating decision maker the CEO.
The Groups operations are split geographically between the UK and the US and have been managed on this basis.
For the purposes of exercising day-to-day managerial and budgetary control, the UK management accounts are divided internally by product but these divisions are not self-standing businesses.
For the purpose of managing the UK business, most common costs are allocated entirely to classified directories.
Control is exercised by comparing performance against budgets that are agreed in advance.
The CEO reviews the turnover and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA before and after exceptional items within geographic segments.

Earnings loss per Share Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive plan.
At 31 March 2005, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the incentive scheme had not been met and consequently the shares in question are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.
Supplementary earnings per share exclude the exceptional costs net of tax and goodwill amortisation: and in 2004 include pro forma interest adjustments net of tax.

For the year ended 31 March 2005, the calculation was based on 701 million shares, the weighted average share capital during the year.
b Group losses for the year ended 31 March 2004 have been adjusted to exclude interest charges on the long-term debt we repaid as a result of the initial public offering as if repaid by 31 March 2003.
Interest has been added back by referring to the effective interest rates applied to the borrowings repaid from the proceeds of the IPO over the period prior to the IPO.
All interest adjustments have been tax effected at the UK corporation tax rate of 30%.
The weighted average number of shares has been adjusted as though the IPO had happened by 31 March 2003. c Exceptional costs are explained in Note 3. d Amortisation charges presented are not adjusted for tax.
If the tax effect from allowable amortisation in the US had been taken into account, then the adjustment would have been 88.0 million, as opposed to 98.6 million and 86.4 million, as opposed to 96.7 million, in 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Accordingly, the adjusted diluted earnings per share would have been 28.9 pence as opposed to 30.4 pence in the year ended 31 March 2005. e Pro forma earnings per share before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation.
For the year ended 31 March 2004 and also as though our initial public offering and debt refinancing had occurred and non-recurring restructuring costs had been incurred before 31 March 2003.
Supplementary basic and diluted EPS have been calculated to exclude the effect of goodwill amortisation.
The adjusted numbers have been provided in order that the effects of goodwill amortisation on reported earnings can be fully appreciated.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management Treasury policy The Groups treasury functions primary role is to fund investments and to manage liquidity and financial risk, including risk from volatility in currency and interest rates and counterparty credit risk.
The treasury function is not a profit centre and its objective is to manage risk at optimum cost.
The board of directors sets the treasury functions policy and its activities are subject to a set of controls commensurate with the magnitude of the investments and borrowings under its management.
Counterparty credit risk is closely monitored and managed within controls set by the board of directors.
Derivative financial instruments, including forward foreign exchange contracts, are normally used only for hedging purposes.
The principal financing and treasury exposures faced by the Group arise from working capital management, the financing of acquisitions and tangible fixed assets, the management of interest rate positions and the investment of surplus cash.
The treasury function manages those exposures with the objective of remaining within ratios covenanted with the senior lenders.
The Group has not purchased or issued any derivative contracts for trading or hedging purposes, except as referred to below.
Up until the initial public offering on 15 July 2003, the Yell Group financed its operations primarily by long-term debt.
Subsequent to the initial public offering, the Yell Group has funded the business largely from cash flows generated from operations.
Details of the Groups borrowings are disclosed in note 16.
All significant cash inflows and outflows associated with the Groups operations in the UK are denominated in pounds sterling, and all significant cash inflows and outflows associated with operations in the US are denominated in dollars.
However, the financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, and changes in the exchange rate between the dollar and pounds sterling will affect the translation of the results of our operations in the US into pounds sterling.
The composition of our debt partially hedges exchange rate fluctuations, because 41.9% of our debt and 35.7% of our net interest expense are denominated in US dollars, thereby reducing our US EBITDA exposure by approximately 18.5%.
The Group does not intend to hedge any foreign exchange rate risk relating to US dollar-denominated notes, although we will continue to review this practice.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and, in order to achieve the objective of managing interest rate risk, partially hedges its risks through the use of interest-rate derivative instruments.
Interest is payable under the senior credit facilities at a variable interest rate.
Under our current senior facilities agreement we were required to have fixed interest on at least 50% of all interest payments during the 21 months following each month end.
This requirement ceased once the Group leverage ratio fell below 3.5 times.
Even so, we have fixed interest on at least 50% of the indebtedness under the senior credit facilities using interest rate swaps over the period to March 2007, with a review of this strategy on a quarterly basis.
During the year ended 31 March 2005, as set out in note 22, net debt decreased from 1,223.0 million to 1,106.1 million, primarily as a result of cash inflows from operating activities.
Other financial instruments The Group also has short-term debtors and creditors that arise in the normal course of business and, therefore, have been excluded from the disclosures which follow.
There has been no change in the role that financial instruments have in creating or changing the Groups risk between 31 March 2005 and the date of these financial statements.
Currency profile and interest rate risk The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities was as shown in the first table on page 80.

Details of currency denomination, interest and maturity profiles of specific borrowings are given in note 16.
There are no material monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than local reporting currencies.
Interest rate profile Details of year-end interest rates on borrowings are set out in note 16.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging future floating interest rate movements.
The Group has fixed interest rates on at least 50% of the interest rate exposure on the indebtedness under the senior credit facilities using interest rate swaps over the period to March 2007.
For the fixed-rate financial liabilities, the average interest rates and the average periods for which the rates are fixed are: At 31 March 2004 At 31 March 2005 Weighted Weighted average average Weighted period Weighted period average for which average for which interest rate is interest rate is rate fixed rate fixed % Years % Years Currency: Sterling 7.1 3.0 6.9 2.8 US dollar 8.5 4.2 8.8 3.8 Total borrowings 7.3 3.4 7.3 3.2 The floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates fixed in advance for periods ranging, at the Groups option, from one month to six months by reference to LIBOR.
The Group expects to continue to fix its floating rate financial liabilities at the end of each month by reference to one month LIBOR at that time.
Borrowing facilities and liquidity risk The Group has maintained committed banking facilities to mitigate any liquidity risk it may face.
There were committed senior debt facilities at 31 March 2005 of 200.0 million 2004 200.0 million of which nil had been drawn down at 31 March 2005 2004 5.0 million.

80 ANNUAL REPORT 2004 05 Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The following table reflects the carrying amount and fair value of the Groups financial instruments at 31 March 2004 and 2005.
The fair values of the financial instruments are the amounts at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in forced liquidation or sale.

A lawsuit filed by Verizon was settled in October 2004.
Following publication of our half year results, Yellow Book USA was served with complaints filed as class actions in five US states and the District of Columbia.
In these actions, the plaintiffs allege violations of consumer protection legislation and are placing reliance on findings of the New York court in the now settled suit brought against Yellow Book USA by Verizon.
On 13 May 2005, the court in New Jersey gave its preliminary approval to a comprehensive national settlement, with no admission of liability.
Notice of the terms of settlement will be published to class members and the final approval hearing is anticipated to be held in late summer 2005.
The total estimated costs of settling these lawsuits is included in exceptional administrative expenses in note 3.
There are no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those referred above and under the section Commitments on page 51 and those arising in the ordinary course of the Groups business.
No material losses are anticipated on liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business.
Pensions SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs Pension costs in respect of the Yell Pension Plan YPP and the defined contribution schemes were: Year ended 31 March 2004 2005 m m Amounts expensed for YPP defined benefit section 8.3 7.9 Amounts expensed for defined contribution schemes 2.4 3.5 Total 10.7 11.4 Yell Pension Plan YPP Defined benefit section There are three defined benefit sections of the YPP, which have been closed to new entrants since 1 October 2001.
There is also an unfunded, unapproved scheme for certain employees.
The pension cost for the year ended 31 March 2005 was based on the valuation at 5 April 2002.
The valuation, carried out by professionally qualified independent actuaries, used the projected unit method in conjunction with a market value of assets.
The principal assumptions used and the results of the valuation are set out below: 5 April 2002 Rates per annum % Valuation method Projected unit Return on existing and future assets 6.0 to 6.5 Average increase in retail price index 2.7 Average future increases in wages and salaries 4.2 Average increase in pensions 2.7 Dividend growth At 5 April 2002 the last valuation date the market value of assets was 102.7 million.
The results of the valuation show that the assets of the scheme were sufficient to cover 102% of the benefits that had accrued to members by that date after allowing for expected future increases in salaries.
The date for the next valuation is expected to be no later than 5 April 2005.
For the year ended 31 March 2005, the Group made regular contributions totalling 7.5 million to the defined benefit section 20048.5 million, together with a 0.4 million contribution to the unapproved scheme.
In addition, a contribution of 0.5 million 20040.9 million in respect of benefit improvements was made and an additional annual contribution of 8.2 million in respect of deficit funding 2004nil.
The Group intends to make an additional annual contribution of approximately 8.5 million in the 2006 financial year.
There are no provisions held on the balance sheet in respect of this plan at 31 March 2005.
The Group has a prepayment of 8.6 million at 31 March 2005 20040.3 million.
The funding policy differs from the accounting policy primarily in that for funding purposes the Group contributes to target a funding level of 105% in the above assumptions.
The YPP assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, fixed interest and index linked securities, deposits and short-term investments.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The trustees set asset allocation targets at 31 March 2004 and 2005 in which approximately 55% of the assets held should be equity investments and 45% should be debt securities.
Defined contribution schemes In addition to the defined contribution section Four of the YPP, Yellow Book sponsor a 401 k plan for the majority of Yellow Book employees in the US.
The plan allows employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax and or after-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines.
Yellow Book matches a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits.
The assets of the plan are held separately from those of Yellow Book in an independently administered fund.
The pension cost in respect of these schemes represents contributions payable to the funds and amounted to 2.9 million in the year ended 31 March 2005 20042.4 million for the Yellow Book scheme, and 0.6 million 2004 0.4 million for Section Four of the YPP.
Outstanding contributions amounted to nil as at 31 March 2005 2004 nil.
90 ANNUAL REPORT 2004 05 FRS 17 Retirement benefits A valuation of the YPP for the purposes of FRS 17 was carried out at 31 March 2002 and updated to 31 March 2004 and 2005 by a qualified independent actuary.
The following key assumptions were used: At 31 March 2003 2004 2005 % per annum % per annum % per annum Discount rate 5.4 5.4 5.4 Salary increases 4.0 4.4 4.4 Pension increases 2.5 2.9 2.9 Inflation rate 2.5 2.9 2.9 The assets in the YPP and the annual expected rates of return were: At 31 March 2003 2004 2005 % m % m%m Equities 7.8 49.9 7.7 66.4 7.7 82.5 Corporate Bonds 5.4 15.8 5.4 3.7 5.4 6.8 Gilts 4.8 28.4 4.7 52.3 4.7 61.2 Total 94.1 122.4 150.5 The expected rates of return were set by reference to yields available on government bonds at the measurement date and appropriate risk margins.
The following amounts as at 31 March 2003, 2004 and 2005 were measured in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17 and show the net balance sheet liability at the year end as if FRS 17 had been adopted: At 31 March 2003 2004 2005 m m m Total market value of assets 94.1 122.4 150.5 Present value of scheme liabilities 141.2 188.8 249.9 Deficit in the scheme 47.1 66.4 99.4 Related deferred tax asset, based on 30% rate of tax 14.1 19.9 29.8 Net balance sheet liability 33.0 46.5 69.6 The following amounts explain the change in the deficit in the scheme for the year ended 31 March 2004 and 2005: At 31 March 2004 2005 m m Deficit in scheme at beginning of year 47.1 66.4 Movement in year: Current service cost 10.4 13.7 Contributions 9.4 16.2 Past service costs 0.8 0.7 Other finance costs 1.5 2.3 Actuarial loss 16.0 32.5 Deficit in scheme at 31 March 66.4 99.4 91 YELL GROUP PLC The full actuarial valuation at 5 April 2002 updated to 31 March 2005 showed a deficit of 99.4 million.
Improvements in benefits costing 0.5 million were made in the year ended 31 March 2005 and contributions of 7.5 million 13.05% of pensionable earnings, plus an additional contribution of 8.2 million in respect of deficit funding were made.
In addition a contribution of 0.8 million in respect of benefit improvements made in the previous year was made on 1 April 2004.
In the year ended 31 March 2005, the Group made contributions at an average rate of 13.05% of pensionable earnings inclusive of expenses and life assurance premiums.
The Groups trustees have agreed that contributions for the next year will continue at the same rate, with an evaluation of future contribution rates after the next full valuation.
The actuarial loss in the year ended 31 March 2005 was primarily the result of changing our assumptions regarding how long scheme members will live after retirement.

Post Balance Sheet Events On 17 May 2005, the Group announced that the US business had entered into a definitive agreement for the purchase the Acquisition of Transwestern Holdings, L. P. Transwestern from Thomas H. Lee Partners, CIVC Partners, LLC and Transwestern management for $1,575 million 829 million in cash.
Transwestern is a leading independent directory publisher in the US, with an extensive footprint in 25 states, including core positions in California and Texas, which complements Yellow Books footprint.
Transwestern published 332 directories during the year ended 31 December 2004.
Transwestern also offers online directory advertising services through WorldPages.
At 17 May 2005, the Group had agreed in principle a new 2 billion credit facility, fully underwritten by ABN AMRO, BNP paribas, Citibank, HSBC and JPMorgan Chase, to refinance all of the existing bank debt of 860 million and to fund the Acquisition, if the Acquisition is completed.
The senior notes remain unaffected.
The acquisition is subject to shareholder approval and Hart Scott Rodino clearance in the USA.
Therefore, completion of the Acquisition can not be assured.
US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles The Groups consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK UK GAAP, which differ in certain respects from those applicable in the US US GAAP.
US GAAP information is provided because US employees have been granted share options.
I Differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles The following are the main differences between UK and US GAAP which are relevant to the Groups financial statements.
a Directories in progress Under UK GAAP, the cost of directories in progress deferred in stock represents direct fixed and variable costs as well as directly attributable overhead costs.
Under US GAAP, the deferred costs associated with directories in progress would only comprise the direct production costs and the incremental direct costs associated with selling and creating the directories.
Directories in progress acquired in a business purchase are valued at replacement value under UK GAAP and at fair value under US GAAP.
Under UK GAAP this difference is included in goodwill.
Under US GAAP, the fair value is charged to the profit and loss upon delivery of the related directories.
b Pensions Under both UK and US GAAP, pension costs are charged against profits over employees working lives.
Differences between the UK and US GAAP figures arise from the requirement to use different actuarial methods and assumptions and a different method of amortising surpluses or deficits, when accounting for a single employer scheme.
97 YELL GROUP PLC c Goodwill and other intangibles Under UK GAAP the purchase price of acquisitions is allocated to the fair market value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets, with the excess recorded as goodwill with an estimated economic life of 20 years.
Goodwill is not amortised under US GAAP and is subject to an annual impairment test.
The Yell Group completed its impairment tests of goodwill as of 31 March 2004 and 2005 and determined that goodwill balances were not impaired.
Under US GAAP the purchase price of acquisitions is allocated to the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets, including acquired customer relationships that are amortised over eight to nine years and brand names that are amortised over five to forty years.
The aggregate amortisation expense for the years ended 31 March 2004 and 2005 and the estimated aggregate amortisation expense for the succeeding five years, assuming a constant US dollar exchange rate, are as follows: m Aggregate amortisation expense For year ended 31 March 2004 86.5 For year ended 31 March 2005 73.0 Estimated amortisation expense For year ending 31 March 2006 60.1 For year ending 31 March 2007 49.9 For year ending 31 March 2008 41.9 For year ending 31 March 2009 35.8 For year ending 31 March 2010 30.6 Goodwill The changes in the net book value of goodwill for the years ended 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2005 are as follows: UK US Yell Group m m m Balance at 31 March 2003 599.4 578.0 1,177.4 Goodwill acquired during year 76.1 76.1 Reversal of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets acquired 8.2 8.2 a Fair value adjustments 3.3 3.3 Currency movements 85.6 85.6 Balance at 31 March 2004 599.4 563.6 1,163.0 Goodwill acquired during year 20.5 20.5 Reversal of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets acquired 16.9 16.9 Fair value adjustments 3.6 3.6 Currency movements 13.9 13.9 Balance at 31 March 2005 599.4 549.7 1,149.1 a The fair value adjustment to goodwill was due to the finalisation of transaction costs in respect of acquisitions in prior years.
98 ANNUAL REPORT 2004 05 Intangible assets under US GAAP comprise: At 31 March 2004 2005 m m Gross book value Acquired customer relationships 498.1 501.3 Brand names 511.6 510.2 Additional minimum liability 1.1 1.7 Goodwill on pension scheme 1,163.0 1,149.1 2,173.8 2,162.3 Accumulated amortisation Acquired customer relationships 224.6 283.3 Brand names 39.6 51.7 Total accumulated amortisation under US GAAP 264.2 335.0 Net book value in accordance with US GAAP 1,909.6 1,827.3 Net book value in accordance with UK GAAP 1,725.3 1,635.0 Estimated UK to US GAAP adjustments 184.3 192.3 Additionally, under US GAAP, the difference between the retail value and net replacement value of directories in progress is included in directories in progress and charged against profits when the directories are delivered.
Under UK GAAP the difference is included in goodwill.
d Derivative financial instruments Certain financial risks are managed through the use of financial instruments, mainly interest rate swaps collars.
These contracts provide economic hedging to the Company: however, they do not qualify as hedges for US GAAP accounting purposes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No 133: Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133, as amended and interpreted.
Derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
Therefore, unrealised gains losses must be recorded in the profit and loss account at each reporting date.
For the interest rate derivative contracts, a gain of 6.1 million would have been recorded for the year ended 31 March 2005 2004a gain of 21.7 million under US GAAP, within interest expense.
The asset at 31 March 2005 would have been 2.9 million 2004a liability of 3.2 million.
These movements reflect the fluctuations in the fair value of the US dollar and pounds sterling floating interest rate swaps since the contracts were agreed, and the unwinding of losses previously recognised under US GAAP which have now been recorded as interest expense under UK GAAP.
e Employee option plans Under UK GAAP, compensation expense on awards of stock options and other share-based compensation is measured based on the intrinsic value of the awards, if any, at the date of grant.
Under US GAAP, compensation expense is measured based on the fair value of the awards at the date of grant.
The fair value of each option grant during the period from 1 April 2003 through June 2003 was estimated at the date of grant using the minimum-value method.
The fair value of each option grant subsequent to June 2003 was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation method.
The total compensation expense for 2005 under US GAAP would have been 6.3 million.
The Group used the following weighted-average assumptions in its estimations of fair value: Year ended 31 March 2004 2005 m m Risk free interest rate 4.4% 4.6% Expected dividend yield 3% 3% Expected volatility 35% 20% Expected life of option 3.7 years 3.6 years f Dividends Under UKGAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in respect of which they are declared.
99 YELL GROUP PLC g Deferred taxation The reconciling adjustment for deferred taxation comprises the tax effects arising from the other UK to US GAAP adjustments listed in the reconciliation below, together with the effect of an adjustment of 16.9 million 20048.2 million to reverse tax benefits associated with the reversal of a valuation allowance recorded on purchase which under US GAAP results in a reduction to goodwill.
At 31 March 2005, the adjustment to decrease shareholders funds deficit of 136.9 million 2004182.9 million decrease included the tax effect of other US GAAP adjustments.
This comprised an adjustment increasing current deferred tax assets by 81.4 million 200435.7 million, increasing non-current deferred tax assets by nil million at 31 March 2005 2004nil which were net of a nil million 20047.7 million, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets arising from operations in the US, and 218.3 million 2004218.6 million of non-current deferred tax liabilities.
Deferred tax assets arising from operations in the UK are considered to be recoverable for all years presented.
h Gross profit under US GAAP presentation Additionally, under UK GAAP, doubtful debt expenses are included in cost of sales.
Under US GAAP, these expenses do not meet the criteria to be classified as cost of sales and thus would be included in administrative costs.
Additionally, distribution costs would be in cost of sales under US GAAP.
II Net loss and shareholders deficit funds reconciliation statements The following statements summarise estimated adjustments, gross of their tax effect, which reconcile loss and shareholders deficit funds from that reported under UK GAAP to that which would have been reported had US GAAP been applied.
