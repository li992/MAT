3 Segmental analysis The Groups primary reporting format is geographical segments and its secondary format is business segments.
The Groups geographical segments are determined by the location of the Groups assets and operations.
The Groups business in each geography is managed separately and held in separate statutory entities.
Each geographical business contains the following three business segments: the Product segment supplies computer hardware and software to large and medium corporate and government customers, and to other distributors: the Technology Solutions segment provides technical and project management skills to enable customers in the corporate and government sectors to implement and integrate new technologies into their infrastructures: the Support and Managed Services segment provides an outsourcing service for specific areas of infrastructure management to customers in the corporate and government sectors.
The sale of goods is reported in the Product segment.
The rendering of services is reported in the Technology Solutions and Support and Managed Services segments.
Transfer prices between geographical segments are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The impact of inter-segment sales on operating profit by segment is not significant.
Geographical segments The following tables present revenue, expenditure and certain asset information regarding the Groups geographical segments for the years ended 31 December 2005 and 2004.

15 Business combinations Further to the German and Austrian acquisition update contained in note 14 of the 2004 Annual Report and Accounts and the outcome of the work of the independent Expert, , the Group has now resolved the tax assets claim noted as a contingent liability in its 2004 Report and Accounts.
On 15 October 2003 the vendors claimed that the Group had breached a provision of the German Purchase Agreement concerning an adjustment relating to tax assets, and issued a claim for 52,165,292 36,892,800 plus interest, for upfront payment of the tax assets as opposed to payment as the assets are utilised.
Following an arbitration hearing, Computacenter reached an agreement with the vendor under which the vendors claim has been withdrawn and Computacenter purchased the tax assets outright.
Although the arbitral tribunal did not render a final decision on the merits of the tax claim, it proposed a settlement which did not allocate value to this claim.
The Net Asset Value claim of 32,448,000 was included as a receivable in trade and other receivables at 31 December 2004: the net result of this agreement is that Computacenter received 40,000,00 26,918,000.
The upfront purchase of the tax assets has resulted in a deferred tax asset on the Group balance sheet.
The resolution of this claim has had no impact in the year on the income statement.
Disposal of subsidiary On 2 January 2005 the Group disposed of its Austrian subsidiary, Computacenter GmbH Computacenter Austria, a company that was a separate geographical segment of the Group.
At 31 December 2004, Computacenter Austria was classified as an asset held for sale, and was stated at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell, and income and expenses for the year ended 31 December 2004 were included within the income statement, details of which are given in note 3.

29 Transition to IFRS For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2004, the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
These financial statements, for the year ended 31 December 2005, are the first that the Group is required to prepare in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
Accordingly the Group has prepared financial statements which comply with IFRS applicable for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and the significant accounting policies meeting those requirements are described in note 2.
In preparing these financial statements, the Group has started from an opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2004, the Groups date of transition to IFRS, and has made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements required by IFRS 1 for the First-time adoption of IFRS.
This note explains the principal adjustments made by the Group in restating its UK GAAP balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Summary of IFRS impact The impact on the profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 is detailed in the table below: Year ended 31 December 2004 Profit before tax, continuing Income tax Discontinued Profit for the operations expense operation year 000 000 000 000 UKGAAP 67,287 19,860 2,642 44,785 Reclassification Discontinued operation 1,568 1 1,567 Adjustments 1a Positive goodwill 282 282 1b Negative goodwill 531 531 2 Share based payment 898 222 676 3 Employee benefits 35 35 4 Accounting for joint venture 185 286 471 Total IFRS adjustments 927 222 286 419 IFRS 67,928 19,639 3,923 44,366 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 COMPUTACENTER PLC 67 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 29 Transition to IFRS continued The impact on total equity and net assets at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003 is shown in the table below: 2004 2003 000 000 UK GAAP 315,138 282,883 Reclassification Discontinued operation Adjustments 1a Positive goodwill 282 1b Negative goodwill 531 2 Share based payment 461 330 3 Employee benefits 883 918 4 Accounting for joint venture 471 5 Proposed dividend 9,785 9,236 Total IFRS adjustments 10,116 9,179 IFRS 325,254 292,062 The adjustments create no material impact on the cash flows of the Group.
Explanatory notes on the impact of IFRS The notes below explain the impact that the adoption of IFRS has had on the Groups consolidated results.
Discontinued operation The discontinued operation relates to the results of Computacenter Austria, which, under IFRS, is classified as held for sale as at 31 December 2004.
For comparative purposes all figures within the 2004 results, in respect of this operation, have been removed from continuing operations.
Under UK GAAP, the relevant amounts were disclosed under discontinued operations in the 2004 year-end accounts only.
Other adjustments 1 IFRS 3 Business combinations: IAS 36 Impairment of assets: IAS 38 Intangible assets IFRS 3 applies to accounting for business combinations for which the agreement date is on or after 31 March 2004.
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations that took place prior to 1 January 2004.
As a result in the opening balance sheet, positive goodwill arising from previous business combinations remains 4.8 million as stated under UK GAAP at 31 December 2003.
The transitional provisions of IFRS 3 have required the Group to carry forward the UK GAAP net book value of positive goodwill as deemed cost under IFRS, and to eliminate the net negative goodwill brought forward under UK GAAP of 531,000 with a corresponding entry in reserves at 1 January 2004.
The adoption of IFRS 3 and IAS 36 has resulted in the Group ceasing annual goodwill amortisation from 1 January 2004.
As a result, the UK GAAP amortisation charge of 282,000 and credit of 531,000, for positive and negative goodwill respectively, have been removed from the Groups 2004 IFRS profit for the year.
2 IFRS 2 Share-based payment IFRS 2 Share-based payment requires an expense to be recognised where the Group buys goods or services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions, or in exchange for other assets equivalent in value to a given number of shares or rights over shares cash-settled transactions.
The main impact of IFRS 2 on the Group is the expensing of employees and Directors share options and other share-based incentives by using an option-pricing model.
The effect of the revised policy has decreased consolidated 2004 profit before tax by 898,000 due to an increase in the employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in equity which is taken to retained earnings.
A corresponding deferred tax movement has also been accounted for.
3 IAS 19 Employee benefits IAS 19 requires the Group to recognise in full liabilities in relation to employee benefits.
As at 1 January 2004, the Group has recognised an additional 918,000 of liabilities for holiday pay and other long-term employee benefits.
The corresponding provision as at 31 December 2004 is 883,000, and as a result, there is an increase in the profit for the year of 35,000 for the year ended 31 December 2004.
68 COMPUTACENTER PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 29 Transition to IFRS continued This introduces seasonality into the Groups result, because the holiday entitlement of employees is typically higher at 30 June than at 31 December.
The additional provision required at 30 June 2004 results in a charge to the half-year income statement of 2,519,000.
4 IAS 31 Interest in joint venture Under UK GAAP the Groups interest in its joint venture was accounted under the gross equity method, which is not a recognised approach under IFRS.
The Group has therefore changed its method of accounting for the joint venture to equity accounting.
During the second half of 2004 the Groups holding in its joint venture was diluted, and its share of the losses exceeded the Groups net investment.
Under UK GAAP the Group was required to continue recognising its share of the losses even though this resulted in a net negative amount in the balance sheet.
Under IFRS the Group only recognises its share of the losses up until the point that its net investment is reduced to zero.
This has resulted in 185,000 of losses and an exceptional charge of 286,000 in respect of the dilution in the Groups holding, both of which were recognised under UK GAAP, not being recognised under IFRS.
5 IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date In accordance with IAS 10, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability in the financial statements as there is no present obligation at the balance sheet date, as defined by IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
Accordingly, the final dividends for 2003 of 9,236,000 and 2004 of 9,785,000 as recognised under previous GAAP are derecognised in the balance sheets for 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2004.
The interim dividend has also been accounted for in this manner.
Other reclassification entries IAS 38 Intangible assets Computer software that is not an integral part of the related hardware is classified as an intangible asset under IFRS, whereas such assets were classified under tangible assets under UK GAAP.
Reclassifications of 2,251,000 have been made between tangible and intangible assets at 1 January 2004, 2,077,000 at 30 June 2004 and 3,167,000 at 31 December 2004 accordingly.
IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates From 1 January 2004, foreign currency translation differences are pulled into a separate reserve.
As stated in note 24, the Group has elected, under the provisions of IFRS 1, to set the historic translation differences on foreign subsidiaries to zero.
Additional changes from 1 January 2005 IAS 32 and 39 Financial instruments: recognition, measurement and disclosure The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IAS 32 and IAS 39 and has not adopted these two standards early.
They have been adopted from 1 January 2005.
The restatement of the balance sheet for the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 is shown in note 30.
The most material changes on adoption of these standards were due to non-recourse financing and accounting for foreign currency forward contracts.
Non-recourse financing For the 2004 comparative numbers, under UK GAAP, the Group adopted a linked presentation of its non-recourse financing, in line with FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions.
Linked presentation is not permitted under IFRS.
Application of IFRS to the non-recourse financing scheme in operation throughout 2004 would have resulted in the financing element being accounted for as borrowings.
There would have been no impact on the 2004 income statement.
Forward currency contracts The Group uses forward currency contracts to hedge material risks associated with movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
In 2004 the material risk related to a 32,448,000 receivable in Euros relating to the purchase of GE CompuNet and GECITS Austria in 2003.
Under UK GAAP the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts were not recognised, and the receivable was recorded at the contract rate.
Under IFRS, foreign currency forward contracts are recognised at their fair value.
The receivable is also recognised at its fair value, and recorded at the spot rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
If IAS 32 and 39 had been applied from 1 January 2004, there would have been an asset of 75,000 on the opening balance sheet, and a net movement in the income statement in 2004, from measuring both instruments at fair value, of a loss of 286,000 before tax.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 COMPUTACENTER PLC 69 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 30 Restatement of balance sheet and equity at 1 January 2005 for the effects of IAS 32 and IAS 39 Under IFRS 1, First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group is not required to present comparative information which complies with IAS 32 and IAS 39.
The Groups hedging strategy is unchanged in respect of covering the risk of foreign currency purchases.

The changes attributable to the fair values of both the hedging instruments and the hedge item are recognised in the income statement at each measurement date.
Under UK GAAP, the Group adopted a linked presentation for its non-recourse debt financing.
This presentation method is not permissible under IFRS and accordingly the finance element has been reclassified as borrowings for 2005.
