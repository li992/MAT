Sensitivity analysis Detailed below for the embedded derivatives is a sensitivity of the fair value to immediate 10% favourable and adverse changes in the key assumptions.
At 31 December 2005 Remaining contract terms 3 to 13 years Contractual notional amount 8,220 million therms Discount rate nominal risk free 4.5% Fair value asset liability $ 2,590 million $ million Natural Gas oil and Discount gas price fuel oil price Power price rate Favourable 10% change 408 30 63 34 Unfavourable 10% change 427 45 58 34 These sensitivities are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance.
Changes in fair value generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of change in assumption to change in fair value may not be linear.
Also, in this table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the embedded derivatives is calculated independently of any change in another assumption.
In reality, changes in one factor may contribute to changes in another, which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
Furthermore, the estimated fair values as disclosed should not be considered indicative of future earnings on these contracts.
The trading result of embedded derivatives held for trading is shown below.

Financial instruments comprise primary financial instruments cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, loans, other investments, trade and other payables, finance debt and provisions and derivative financial instruments interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts, oil price contracts, natural gas price contracts and power price contracts.
Interest rate contracts include futures contracts, swap agreements and options.
Foreign exchange contracts include forwards, futures contracts, swap agreements and options.
Oil, natural gas and power price contracts are those that require settlement in cash and include futures contracts, swap agreements and options.
Oil, natural gas and power price contracts that require physical delivery are not financial instruments.
However, if it is normal market practice for a particular type of oil, natural gas and power contract, despite having contract terms that require settlement by delivery, to be extinguished other than by physical delivery e. g. by cash payment, it is called a cash-settled commodity contract.
Contracts of this type are included with derivatives in the disclosures in Notes 37 and 38.
With the exception of the table of currency exposures shown on page 80, short-term trade and other receivables and trade and other payables that arise directly from the groups operations have been excluded from the disclosures contained in this note, as permitted by FRS 13.

The proportion of floating rate debt at 31 December 2004 was 96% of total finance debt outstanding.
Aside from debt issued in the US municipal bond markets, interest rates on floating rate debt denominated in US dollars are linked principally to London Inter-Bank Offer Rate LIBOR, while rates on debt in other currencies are based on local market equivalents.
The group monitors interest rate risk using a process of sensitivity analysis.
Assuming no changes to the finance debt and hedges described above, it is estimated that a change of 1% in the general level of interest rates on 1 January 2005 would change 2005 profit before tax by approximately $215 million.

Fixed asset investments included in the table above are held for the long term and have no maturity period.
They are excluded from the calculation of weighted average time until maturity.
Similarly, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments, which are highly liquid financial assets, are excluded from the calculation of weighted average time until maturity.
