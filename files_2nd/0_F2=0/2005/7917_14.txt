Implementation of UK Accounting Standards New accounting standards FRS 17 Retirement benefits This standard applies to all types of benefits that an employer provides after employees have completed their service, including pension and postretirement healthcare benefits.
The standard sets out revised requirements for the accounting and disclosure of an employers retirement benefits and related funding.
The transitional disclosure requirements of the standard have been provided in the Group accounts from 2001 to 2004.
The standard has been adopted in full in these financial statements.
Compliance with FRS 17 has reduced the 2004 shareholders funds by 237m reduction in prepayment of 338m, reduction in provisions of 108m and increase in other creditors of 7m and decreased net profit for 2004 by 8m.
FRS 20 Share-based payment The Company operates a range of share-based incentive schemes both awards of options and awards of shares and has applied the requirements of FRS 20 for the first time in these financial statements.
The Company has elected not to adopt the exemption to apply FRS 20 only to awards made after 7 November 2002, instead a full retrospective approach has been followed on all grants not fully vested at the date of adoption to maintain consistency across reporting periods.
Under FRS 20, an expense is recognised in the income statement for all share-based payments calculated based on the fair value at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
Compliance with FRS 20 has reduced the 2004 shareholders funds by nil and decreased net profit for 2004 by 3m.
Net profit for 2005 has also been reduced by 3m.
FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date This standard sets out revised requirements for accounting for events after the balance sheet date.
As a result of this standard, dividends can only be recognised at the balance sheet date if a legal liability exists.
The second interim dividend for 2005 is therefore not recognised until the dividend is declared which is after the balance sheet date.
The 2004 second interim dividend was not declared at 31 December 2004, therefore the dividend charge recognised in the profit and loss and the dividend creditor recognised in the balance sheet have been reversed.
Compliance with FRS 21 has increased the 2004 shareholders funds by 46m.
FRS 22 Earnings per share This standard which was issued on 2 December 2004 and prescribes the basis for calculating and presenting earnings per share in the financial statements.
This standard applies to listed companies that do not prepare consolidated financial statements and therefore will not impact the Companys financial statements.
The statement was effective for years ended after 1 January 2005.
FRS 23 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates This standard which was issued on 2 December 2004 and prescribes how to include foreign currency transactions and foreign operations in financial statements and how to translate financial statements into a presentational currency.
The statement is effective from 1 January 2005.
Following the Companys policy for adoption of FRS 26 see below, the requirements of FRS 23 have been applied prospectively from 1 January 2005.
Compliance with FRS 23 has increased 2005 net profit by 6m.
FRS 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation FRS 25 supersedes FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosure and substantially amends FRS 4 Capital instruments.
The standard is effective from 1 January 2005.
However, as consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the IFRS equivalent standard IAS 32, the parent Company is exempt from the disclosure requirements of this standard.
FRS 26 Financial instruments: Measurement FRS 26 applies to all listed entities for the periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and prescribes new accounting rules relating to financial instruments and hedge accounting.
This standard has been adopted in full in these financial statements and the requirement applied prospectively from 1 January 2005.

For details on dividends paid and payable during the year, see note 27 to the Group accounts.
xiii Commitments and contingencies 2005 2004 m m Commitments for capital expenditure not provided for in these accounts including acquisitions Contracts placed for future expenditure 2 4 Expenditure authorised but not yet contracted 4 5 6 9 Contingent liabilities existed at 31 December 2005 in connection with guarantees and uncalled capital relating to subsidiary and other undertakings and guarantees relating to pension funds, including the solvency of pension funds.
The maximum contingent liability for the Company, mainly on guarantees of borrowings by subsidiaries, was 1,203m 2004 1,123m.
In particular, the Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the debt securities of its wholly owned subsidiary ICI Wilmington, Inc. From time to time, the Company, in the ordinary course of business, also provides guarantees to its wholly owned subsidiaries.
The Company has not adopted amendments to FRS 26 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which will apply for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2006.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts and guarantees the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time that it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the financial statements for the period commencing 1 January 2006. xiv Post-retirement benefits The Company operates defined contribution and multi-employer defined benefit schemes for its employees.
The cost recognised in the period for defined contribution schemes amounted to 45m in 2005 2004 51m.
Outstanding contributions at the balance sheet date amounted to nil 2004 nil.
The principal multi-employer defined benefit schemes in operation in the UK are the ICI Pension Fund and the ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund.
The date of the most recent full actuarial funding valuation for the ICI Pension Fund and the ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund was 31 March 2005.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of these funds.
The deficit on the ICI Pension Fund and ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund amounted to 817m and 140m respectively at 31 December 2005.
Under FRS 17, the Company treats its contributions into these schemes as though they were defined contributions and has consequently not recognised any deficit relating to these schemes.

The Company has applied the requirement of FRS 20 Share-based payment and has elected not to adopt the exemption to apply FRS 20 only to awards made after 7 November 2002, instead a full retrospective approach has been followed on all grants not fully vested at the date of transition in order to maintain consistency across the reporting periods.
The fair value of awards granted is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, refer to note 7 relating to the Group accounts for the fair value assumptions used.
