58.22 PF BACK P5a LM 23 3 06 8:50 pm Page 99 Notes to the financial statements continued 24 Retirement benefit obligations a Pension schemes defined benefit The group and company operate a number of UK based pension schemes.
The two major defined benefit schemes are the Provident Financial Senior Pension Scheme the senior pension scheme and the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme the staff pension scheme.
The schemes cover 79% of employees with company provided pension arrangements and are of the funded, defined benefit type providing retirement benefits based on final salary.
The two defined benefit schemes were closed to new members from 1 January 2003.
Additionally, following a full group review of pension scheme arrangements during 2005, from 1 April 2006 the schemes will provide members with a choice of retirement benefits based on final salary and retirement benefits based on revalued career earnings.
The most recent actuarial valuations of scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 1 June 2004 by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation used for the purposes of IAS 19 has been based on these valuations which have been updated by the actuary to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 December 2005.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value at 31 December 2005.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: Group and company 2005 2004 %% Price inflation 2.80 2.75 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.38 4.34 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.80 2.75 Discount rate 4.80 5.40 Long-term rate of return equities 7.85 7.85 bonds 4.10 4.60 other 4.50 4.80 overall weighted average 6.74 7.17 The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the defined benefit pension schemes are based on the mortality experience of insured pension schemes and allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
For members of the staff scheme it is assumed that members who retire in the future at age 65 will live on average for a further 20 years if they are male and for a further 23 years if they are female.
For members of the senior scheme it is assumed that members who retire in the future at age 65 will live on average for a further 22 years if they are male and for a further 24 years if they are female.
The current mortality assumptions will be re-assessed in 2006 as part of a full actuarial valuation of both schemes.
If assumed life expectancies had been one year greater for both schemes, the charge to the group income statement would have increased by approximately 1.2m and the deficit would have increased by approximately 20.0m.
