This goodwill is being amortised on a straight line basis over 20 years.
This reflects the period over which the Directors estimate that the values of the underlying businesses acquired are expected to exceed the value of the underlying assets.
Negative goodwill relates to the acquisition of Burtonwood see note 27 and is being amortised over the estimated useful life of the fixed assets, being the non-monetary assets.
Following the disposal of certain fixed assets, an impairment review of the remaining goodwill was undertaken in order to reduce it to its estimated residual value.
This resulted in an impairment charge of 1.1m 2004: 1.7m.
