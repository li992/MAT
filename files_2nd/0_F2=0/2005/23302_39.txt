In pursuit of this objective, the Company may be exposed to various forms of risk, as described below.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Investments held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies Cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations Debenture stocks The risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk, which comprises interest rate risk, equity price changes and foreign currency exposure, liquidity risk and counterparty credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Short-term debtors and other short-term creditors are excluded from the following analyses.
Market risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
At each Board meeting the Board considers the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Investment Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk-reward profile.
The Company has the option to invest up to 200m of the debenture stocks in the equity market.
In a rising market the Company would benefit, but in a falling market the impact would be severe.
In order to manage the level of gearing, the Investment Manager invests part of the assets available in the Fidelity Institutional Cash Fund and short-term cash deposits.
This controls the level of net gearing.
As mentioned in the Chairmans statement on page 3 the current policy is that only 90m to 130m of the debenture stocks is invested in the equity market.
Long and short futures positions have been used during the year as a quick and effective means to either increase or decrease the Companys exposure to the equity market.
Due to the movement of markets in the year transactions in short futures have resulted in realised capital losses of 260,000 2004: losses 3,452,000 and transactions in long futures have resulted in capital gains of 19,000 2004: nil.
