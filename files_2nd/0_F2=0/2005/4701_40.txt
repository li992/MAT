Capitalised brands are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives and have not been amortised.
These brands are protected in all of the major markets where they are sold by trademarks, which are renewable indefinitely.
There are not believed to be any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit the useful life.
The nature of the premium drinks industry is that obsolescence is not a common issue, with indefinite brand lives being commonplace and Diageo has a number of brands that were originally created more than 100 years ago.
Accordingly the directors believe that it is appropriate that the brands are treated as having indefinite lives for accounting purposes.
An annual review is carried out by the directors to consider whether any brand has suffered an impairment in value.
The principal acquired brands included above are Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, Crown Royal, Captain Morgan and Windsor Premier.
