NOTES T O THE FINANCIAL ST A T EMENTS 1.
Accounting policies Basis of accounting and consolidation The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable UK accounting standards, applied on a consistent basis, under the historical cost convention modied by the revaluation of certain xed assets.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the holding companys profit and loss account has not been included in these financial statements.
Change in accounting policy The Company has adopted UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts and UITF 17 revised December 2003 Employee share schemes.
Under UITF 38 the Companys own shares held by the ESOP trust are deducted from shareholders funds until they vest unconditionally in employees.
Prior to the adoption of UITF 38, the Companys own shares held by the ESOP trust were recognised as an asset on the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Under UITF 17 revised December 2003 the profit and loss charge for share options and awards is determined with reference to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant.
Prior to the adoption of the revised UITF 17 the profit and loss charge was determined by reference to the cost of shares purchased by the ESOP trust.
Prior year adjustment The change in accounting policy outlined above results in a reduction to investments and equity shareholders funds at 31 March 2004 of 6.4m.
profit for the financial year ended 31 March 2004 is reduced by 0.3m.
profit for earlier financial years is reduced by 0.3m resulting in a total adjustment to the profit and loss account of 0.6m, which is recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
profit for the year ended 31 March 2005 is reduced by 0.7m.
The cash ow statement has been restated to show the exercise of share options within Financing.
Turnover Turnover represents the total amount receivable for the provision of goods and services, excluding value added tax.
Turnover is recognised in the period when the service or supply is provided: a annual fees are recognised over the 12 month period to which the fee relates b admission fees are recognised at the time of admission to trading c data, transaction and Exchange charges are recognised in the month in which the data is provided or the transaction is effected.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies and currency balances at the year end are converted at the rate ruling at the transaction date or year end date respectively, except where covered by an open foreign exchange contract when the contract rate is used.
Intangible assets Intangible assets represent goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, being the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of net assets acquired.
Goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis over a period not exceeding 20 years.
Impairment reviews are performed at the end of the first full year after acquisition and where there is an indication of potential impairment.
Tangible assets and depreciation a Freehold properties, including related xed plant, have been revalued by external chartered surveyors and are included in the financial statements at the revalued amounts.
Following the implementation of FRS 15 no revaluations of freehold properties after March 1997 have been made.
Freehold buildings and related xed plant are depreciated, based on cost or valuation at the beginning of the year plus subsequent additions, over their estimated economic lives.
The economic lives of properties are approximately 50 years, the estimated useful lives of xed plant range from five to 20 years.
b Leasehold properties and improvements are included at cost and depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease or the economic life of the asset.
c Plant and equipment is stated at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are mainly in the range from three to five years.
Third party software costs for the development and implementation of systems which enhance the services provided by the Company are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is an average of three years.
d The Group selects its depreciation rates based on expected economic lives, taking into account the expected rate of technological developments, market requirements and expected use of the assets.
The selected rates are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain appropriate to the Groups circumstances.
Joint ventures The Groups share of profits, less losses, from joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and the Groups share of gross assets and gross liabilities underlying the net equity amount is included in the consolidated balance sheet.
Fixed asset investments Other xed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision required for impairment in value.
Provisions A provision is recognised where there is a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event for which it is probable that a transfer of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Operating leases Rental costs for operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account when incurred.
Lease incentives at commencement of a lease are allocated over the period to the first rent review.
Provision is made in the accounts for lease commitments, less income from sub-letting, for property space which is surplus to business requirements.

Accounting policies continued Pension costs Pension costs for the dened benefit plan are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent actuary.
The accounting cost for providing dened benefit pensions is charged over the period during which the Company benets from the services of employees.
The cost is calculated so as to produce a substantially level percentage of the current and future pensionable payroll.
Pension costs under the dened contribution plan are charged as incurred.
Further details of the Companys pension schemes and the basis upon which the charge to the profit and loss account is determined are set out in note 25 to the financial statements.

Pension costs The Company operates one pension plan which includes separate dened benefit and dened contribution schemes.
The assets of the dened benefit and dened contribution schemes are held separately from those of the Company and the funds are managed by Schroder Investment Management Limited and Legal & General Investment Management Limited respectively.
Dened benefit scheme The dened benefit scheme is non-contributory and provides benets based on final pensionable pay.
Pension costs are determined by an independent qualied actuary on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit method and are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Company.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2003 by an independent qualied actuary.
The market value of the plans assets for the scheme was 159m, representing 88 per cent of the value of benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in salaries.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
The main assumptions for the 31 March 2003 valuation were an investment return of 5 per cent per annum for pension payments in the next 30 years and 7.5 per cent per annum for pension payments thereafter, salary increases of 4.5 per cent per annum and pension increases of 3.7 per cent per annum.
Dened contribution scheme The Companys dened contribution scheme is now the only scheme open to new employees.
A core contribution of eight per cent of pensionable pay is provided and the Company will match employee contributions up to a maximum of six per cent of pensionable pay.
Pension contributions The contribution rate for the dened benefit scheme for 2005 was 23 per cent of pensionable salaries 2004: 23 per cent.
As the dened benefit scheme is closed to new members, under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as members approach retirement.
In addition to the normal contributions to the dened benefit scheme, the Company made additional contributions of 3.2m 2004: 3.2m during the year.
These additional contributions are treated as a prepayment in the accounts and are charged to the profit and loss account over the expected remaining service lives of scheme members.

The following information is provided under the disclosure requirements of FRS 17 - Retirement Benets.
The Accounting Standards Board has deferred the full adoption of FRS 17 until implementation of International Accounting Standards in 2005.
The costs for the dened contribution scheme are unchanged by FRS 17 and are as set out above.
Dened benefit valuation An actuarial review was carried out at 31 March 2003, 2004 and 2005 by an independent qualied actuary to provide the information required by FRS 17.

Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOP Following approval at the 2004 AGM a new Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was introduced during the year.
This scheme has two elements, a conditional award of Performance Shares and an award of Matching Shares linked to investment by the executive of annual bonus in the Companys shares.
Vesting of these awards is dependent upon the Companys total shareholder return performance.
Further details are provided in the Remuneration report on pages 27 to 33.
Under the Companys previous share option plan approved by shareholders in 2002, the maximum value of shares placed under option to an individual was equivalent to 100 per cent of their annual salary.
No further awards will be made under this scheme.
Prior to 2002, under the previous long term incentive scheme comprising the Initial and Annual Share Plans, option grants and share awards were made based on approvals prior to the Companys listing in July 2001.
No further option grants or share awards will be made under this scheme apart from the SAYE scheme available to all staff.
Under both the Initial and Annual Share Plan, share awards have a vesting period of three years and share options become exercisable at 20 per cent per annum over five years.
The SAYE scheme provides for grants of options to employees who enter into a SAYE savings contract and options were granted at 20 per cent below fair market value.
Share awards were granted at nil cost to employees and share options were granted at fair market value or above.
Under UITF 17 revised a charge equal to the intrinsic value at the date of grant is made to the profit and loss account, although, as provided under UITF 17 revised, no charge is made in the accounts in respect of the SAYE scheme.
The Company established an ESOP discretionary trust to administer the share plans and to acquire the Companys shares to meet commitments to employees.
At the balance sheet date, 878,694 shares 2004: 2,971,092 shares were held by the trust, at an initial cost of 3.8m.
This was funded by an interest free loan from the Company.
At the balance sheet date, the market value of these shares was 4.0m 2004: 10.4m.
Dividends on shares held in respect of the previous long term incentive scheme and the Annual Bonus Plan have not been waived by the trust, dividends on shares held in respect of the new LTIP and share options have been waived by the trust amounting to 0.1m 2004: 0.1m.
The special dividend was waived on all shares held by the trust amounting to 0.9m.
In accordance with UITF 38, the assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOP trust have been included in the Companys financial statements.
