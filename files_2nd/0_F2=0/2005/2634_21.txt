45 ExPlANATiON OF TRANSiTiON TO iFRS The effect of the transition to IFRS on the Company income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004 was to reduce administrative expenses and increase profit by US$2,810,000 in respect of adjustments made resulting from the implementation of IFRS 2.
This is explained in paragraph d of the notes to the reconciliation of 2004 Group profit in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.
The effect of the transition to IFRS on the Company balance sheet at 31 December 2004 was to increase its net equity by US$7,550,000 due to the requirement to recognise dividends in the period in which they are formally declared rather than the period to which they relate.
Net equity at 1 January 2004 was increased by US$4,171,000 due to the fide-recognition of an accrual under UK GAAP for a deferred share award, as described in paragraph c of the notes to the reconciliation of Group equity at 1 January 2004 in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.
