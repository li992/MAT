50 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards INTRODUCTION For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2004, BP prepared its financial statements in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting practice UK GAAP.
BP, together with all other European Union EU companies listed on an EU stock exchange, was required to prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the EU with effect from 1 January 2005.
The Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2005 comprises BPs first consolidated financial statements prepared under IFRS.
The financial statements of the parent company are still prepared under UK GAAP.
In preparing these financial statements, the group has complied with all IFRSs applicable for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
In addition, BP has also decided to adopt early IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources, the amendment to IAS 19 Amendment to International Accounting Standard IAS 19 Employee Benefits: Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures, the amendment to IAS 39 Amendment to International Accounting Standard IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Cash Flow Hedge Accounting of Forecast Intragroup Transactions and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease.
The EU has adopted all standards and interpretations adopted by BP for its 2005 reporting.
The general principle that should be applied on first-time adoption of IFRS is that standards in force at the first reporting date for BP, 31 December 2005 should be applied retrospectively.
However, IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 1 contains a number of exemptions which companies are permitted to apply.
BP has taken the following exemptions: Comparative information on financial instruments is prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and the group has adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39 from 1 January 2005.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations has not been applied to acquisitions of subsidiaries or of interests in jointly controlled entities and associates that occurred before 1 January 2003.
Cumulative currency translation differences for all foreign operations are deemed to be zero at 1 January 2003.
The group has recognized all cumulative actuarial gains and losses on pensions and other post-retirement benefits as at 1 January 2003 directly in equity.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has been applied retrospectively to all share-based payments that had not vested before 1 January 2003.
As indicated above, BP adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 with effect from 1 January 2005 and, as permitted under IFRS 1, the group has not restated comparative information.
Had IAS 32 and IAS 39 been applied from 1 January 2003, the following adjustments would have been necessary in the financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2004 and 2003: All derivatives, including embedded derivatives, would have been brought on to the balance sheet at fair value.
Available-for-sale investments would have been carried at fair value rather than at cost.
The principal differences for the group between reporting on the basis of UK GAAP and IFRS are as follows: Ceasing to amortize goodwill.
Setting up deferred taxation on: acquisitions: inventory valuation differences: unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates.
Expensing a greater proportion of major maintenance costs.
No longer recognizing dividends proposed but not declared as a liability at the balance sheet date.
Recognizing an expense for the fair value of employee share option schemes.
Recording asset swaps on the basis of fair value.
Recognizing changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives in the income statement.
The new accounting policies adopted by the group are summarized on pages 30-38.
The financial information presented in this note does not take account of the Innovene operations treated as discontinued in 2005.

joint arrangements Under UK GAAP, certain of the groups activities were conducted through joint arrangements and were included in the consolidated financial statements in proportion to the groups share of the income, expenses, assets and liabilities of these joint arrangements.
However, IFRS requires that, if such joint arrangements comprise a legal entity, they be treated as jointly controlled entities.
The group has chosen to account for jointly controlled entities under the equity method.
The entities affected include Atlantic LNG Trains 2 and 3, a group of German refineries and chemicals operations, the South Caucasus Pipeline Company and other minor operations.

IFRS requires the presentation of equity-accounted results as a single net profit item in the income statement.
Consequently, the groups share of all the individual equity-accounted items has been removed from the relevant lines in the income statement and offset against the results of equity-accounted entities to present them on a net-of-tax basis.

Under this standard, retirement benefit obligations and assets are presented on a net-of-tax basis in the balance sheet.
IFRS, however, requires that these assets and liabilities be shown gross, with the related deferred tax effects included within the deferred tax captions in the balance sheet.
An adjustment has therefore been made to reclassify the deferred tax balances.

Under IFRS, however, goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment review.
In accordance with IFRS 1, an impairment test was carried out at the date of transition DoT.
No impairment was identified and no other adjustments to the value of goodwill were made.
This adjustment reverses the amortization of goodwill charged under UK GAAP after the DoT to IFRS.

As a result, deferred tax needs to be recognized under IFRS in respect of a number of differences for which no deferred tax was recognized under UK GAAP.
The major areas affected by this are described below.
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS, additional deferred tax has been provided on the temporary difference created by the allocation of fair values to the non-current assets acquired in a business combination.
The consequent increase in the difference between the carrying value of non-current assets and the tax base is not considered to be a timing difference under UK GAAP, but is regarded as a temporary difference for IFRS.
An adjustment is therefore required to reflect the increase in the deferred tax liability at the DoT.
The resulting deferred tax liability changes due to the depreciation or impairment of the underlying fixed asset.

Under IFRS, the group will continue to capitalize expenditure where it enhances the performance of an asset or replaces an asset or part of an asset that meets the groups definition of a part of an asset in accordance with IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment.
Other elements of expenditure incurred during major plant maintenance shutdowns, such as overhaul costs, are not permitted to be capitalized under IFRS.
There is therefore a reduction in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment to reflect this change for expensing overhaul costs that no longer qualify for capitalization.

The costs of awards under the long-term incentive plans were accrued over the performance period of each plan, based on the estimated actual cost of shares, and an adjustment was made to reflect the actual cost when the final award was confirmed.
The cost of other share-based schemes was based on the fair value of the awards.
IFRS requires the fair value of the option and share awards that ultimately vest to be charged to the income statement over the vesting or performance period.
The fair value is determined at the date of the grant using an appropriate pricing model i. e. a binomial model.
If an award fails to vest as the result of certain types of performance condition not being satisfied, the charge to the income statement will be adjusted to reflect this.
BP has developed a binomial or lattice-type pricing model, which has been used to arrive at the fair value at the grant date of the share option schemes and part of the award under the long-term incentive plans.
The other part of the long-term incentive plans is based on market conditions and has been valued using a Monte Carlo model.
Although IFRS 1 allows entities to restrict the recognition of the expense of share-based payments to those schemes granted after 7 November 2002 that have not vested as of 1 January 2005, BP has elected to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payment fully retrospectively.

IFRS requires assets acquired in asset exchanges to be accounted for at fair value at the date of the transaction, with any gain or loss recognized in income.
In 2000, BP agreed to a transaction with its partners in the Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska whereby it received an increase in its natural gas interest in return for a reduction in its share of liquids production.
In 2001, BP undertook a transaction with Solvay that led to the exchange of businesses for an interest in a joint venture and an associated undertaking.
The transaction has been recorded at fair value for IFRS.
On 1 November 2004 BP acquired Solvays interests in these ventures and has accounted for this as a business combination.

Under IFRS, the proposed dividend can be recognized only in the period in which it is properly authorized or paid, which, in the case of BP, is the quarter following that to which the dividend relates, i. e. the dividend proposed in February 2005 in respect of the fourth quarter of 2004 can be accounted for only in the first quarter of 2005.
Therefore each balance sheet is adjusted to derecognize the dividend declared after the balance sheet date.

Under UK GAAP these cumulative currency translation differences remained in equity.
IFRS requires that, when an entity is wholly or partially disposed of, such cumulative translation differences be recycled to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
In addition, there is a requirement to maintain such differences as a separate component of equity.
In accordance with one of the exemptions in IFRS 1, the amount of this component has been deemed by BP to be zero at the DoT.
Consequently, only those translation differences that arise after the DoT will be recycled upon disposal of a foreign operation.

However, derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes were recognized by applying either the accrual method or the deferral method.
Under the accrual method, amounts payable or receivable in respect of derivatives are recognized ratably in earnings over the period of the contracts.
Changes in the derivatives and fair values are not recognized.
On the deferral method, gains and losses from derivatives are deferred and recognized in earnings or as adjustments to carrying amounts as the underlying hedged transaction matures or occurs.
For IFRS, all financial assets and financial liabilities have to be recognized initially at fair value.
In subsequent periods the measurement of these financial instruments depends on their classification into one of the following measurement categories: i financial assets or financial liabilities  such as those used for trading purposes, and all derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting : ii loans and receivables: and iii available-for-sale financial assets including certain investments held for the long term.
Fair value hedges Where fair value hedge accounting was applied to transactions that hedge the groups exposure to the changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or a recognized asset or liability that are attributable to a specific risk the derivatives designated as hedging instruments are recorded at their fair value in the groups balance sheet and changes in their fair value are recognized in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognized in the income statement.
The pay floating interest rate swaps and currency swaps hedging the debt book in place on 1 January 2005 were highly effective and consequently qualify as fair value hedges for hedge accounting.
The full fair value of the swaps was recognized on the balance sheet and the carrying value of debt was adjusted.

The hedged instrument is recognized at fair value on the balance sheet.
At maturity of the hedged item, the element deferred in equity is treated in accordance with the nature of the hedged exposure, for example, capitalized into the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment, or expensed in the case of a hedge of a tax payment.

For IFRS, these investments are classified as available-for-sale financial assets, and as such need to be recorded at fair value with the gain or loss arising as a result of the change in fair value being recorded directly in equity.
The transition adjustment relates to the fair value of listed investments held by the group.
In accordance with IAS 39, all future fair value adjustments will be booked directly in equity until disposal of the investment, when the cumulative associated gains losses are recycled through the income statement.
At this point, the gain or loss on disposal under IFRS will be identical to that which would result using historical cost accounting.

Where derivatives that are used to manage interest rate risk, to convert non-US dollar debt or to hedge other anticipated cash flows are terminated before the underlying debt matures or the hedged transaction occurs, the resulting gain or loss is recognized on a basis that matches the timing and accounting treatment of the underlying debt or hedged transaction.
On transition to IFRS, only assets and liabilities that qualify as such can continue to be recognized.
Consequently, all gains and losses that were generated by derivatives used for hedging purposes and deferred in the balance sheet as if they were assets or liabilities must be eliminated from the transitional balance sheet.
This is achieved by transferring gains and losses arising from cash flow hedges to equity, pending recycling to income at a later date, and by transferring gains and losses arising from fair value hedges to adjust the carrying value of the hedged item, in this case, finance debt.
