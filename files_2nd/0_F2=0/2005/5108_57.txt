The principal financial instruments used by the Group to finance its operations are cash and loans.
The significant financial risks faced by the Group and the policies that it applies are considered below.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
Over the past year the Group has used a limited range of derivative financial instruments and forward contracts to hedge its exposure to US dollar rates and Jet A1 fuel costs.
The Group has not used any financial instruments to hedge its exposure to other foreign currencies and interest rate fluctuations, although natural hedges limit the exposures to these risks.
The primary hedging approach implemented has been to limit exposure to significant adverse movements in US dollar exchange rates and Jet A1 fuel costs using a range of option products.
In addition, forward contracts for jet fuel requirements were used in the second half of the reporting period.
The level of hedging cover taken during the year has been up to 80% of projected cash flows for US dollar and up to 80% for Jet A1 fuel on a one year horizon, and to hedge a smaller percentage of estimated expense up to 36 months in advance.
At 30 September 2005, the hedging in place included a range of options on US dollar sterling and Jet A1 fuel.
For the purposes of this note, other than currency disclosures, the only debtors and creditors included are bank and shareholder loans, in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 13, Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments.
Annual report and accounts 05 85 plc 95 05 Notes continued 23 Financial Instruments continued Foreign currency risk The Group has an international business.
Its reporting and principal trading currency is sterling.
Aircraft purchases, sales and leasing transactions together with other aircraft related costs are denominated in US dollars.
The Group also operates, to a lesser extent, in a number of other currencies.
The Groups trade activity is concentrated in Europe, where there is a matching, to some extent, of the cash inflows and outflows of different European currencies.
The majority of the Groups trading revenue is derived in sterling, although a significant amount of revenue is also derived in other European currencies and, other than fuel, insurance, aircraft leases, interest expense on external borrowings and some maintenance costs, the Groups cost base has a similar profile.
Fuel, insurance, aircraft leases, some interest expense on external borrowings and some maintenance costs are payable in US dollars and movements in the value of the US dollar against sterling impact these costs to the Group: a strong sterling against the US dollar reduces these costs to the Group.
30% of the total Group costs in the year ended 30 September 2005 were incurred by easyJet in the US dollar 2004: 30%.
There were minimal US dollar revenues.
Approximately 27% 2004: 30% of the Groups total assets that is, its owned aircraft and deposits paid towards the future acquisition of aircraft are denominated in US dollars, with the effect that the Groups balance sheet and, in particular, shareholders funds, can be significantly affected by movements in the rate of sterling against the US dollar.
The Group mitigates the effect of such movements by borrowing in the same currencies as those US dollar denominated assets.
Owned aircraft are anticipated to be sold for US dollars within approximately seven years of their acquisition.
The resulting sale proceeds are expected to be used largely to pay down US dollar loans and as a result these large US dollar inflows are not considered to create a significant currency exposure to the Group.
The US dollar sterling exchange rates at the respective year end were as follows: Year end exchange rate US$: 30 September 2005 1.7690 30 September 2004 1.8100 3% of the total Group costs in the year ended 30 September 2005 were incurred by easyJet Switzerland 2004: 3%, whose functional currency is the Swiss Franc.
The costs of that business are translated into sterling at average exchange rates for the purposes of inclusion into the consolidated profit and loss account, and the net assets at the year-end exchange rate of the Swiss Franc against sterling.
To a large extent, the exposure to the Swiss Franc is mitigated as revenue in that currency is also earned by the Group.
The table below summarises the Groups exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operation to which they relate.

This target is to be achieved as leases on the new Airbus planes are implemented and the 16 remaining fixed rate leases acquired with Go Fly expire.
The fixed and floating rate interest profile for leases at 30 September 2005 was 68% 32% for the Airbus aircraft and 59% 41% for the entire fleet 2004: 47% 53% for the Airbus aircraft and 58% 42% for the entire fleet.
There is no such formal policy on bank loans, which are all at floating rates.

The variable rate bank loans bear interest by reference to US dollar LIBOR or sterling LIBOR plus a margin.
The loans are repayable in quarterly and six monthly instalments.
The majority of the Groups financial assets comprise bank balances, which attract interest at the applicable money market deposit rates.
At 30 September 2005, all of the Groups cash and liquid resources had a maturity of 180 days or less and attracted a weighted average rate of 4.3% 2004: 3.6%.
The Group also pays operating lease rentals for the lease of aircraft.

Credit risk Potential concentrations comprise principally cash, trade debtors and hedging relationships.
The majority of the Groups trade debtors are represented by amounts due from a few well established credit card acquirers.
The cash balances are held with several major banks and rated money market funds.
The credit ratings for the credit card acquirers, banks and money market funds do not suggest there to be significant exposure as a result of these concentrations.
The hedging amounts due arise with major financial counterparties with credit ratings of A or better.
Funding risk The most significant investment activity undertaken by the Group historically has been the acquisition of aircraft.
To a large extent, the Group sells and leases back the aircraft to manage its funding risks.
The Group also owns planes which have been financed by asset-backed bank loans.
In March 2003, the Group agreed to purchase 120 new Airbus A319 planes for delivery over the next five years.
At 30 September 2005, the Group had taken delivery of 55 Airbus aircraft and has plans to take delivery of a further 32 in the coming year.
As a result of the order and expected deliveries, the Group continues to make significant deposits on aircraft.
At the same time it is recovering deposits paid previously as aircraft are taken delivery of.
As the Group has large cash resources to meet these payments and financing is arranged for the planes prior to delivery, no significant funding risk is perceived.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities A comparison by category of book value and fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is provided in the table below.
30 September 2005 30 September 2004 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value million million million million Primary financial instruments held to finance the Groups operations: Fuel hedges 10.3 13.7 Currency hedges 10.2 1.0 Bank loans 217.3 217.3 119.8 119.8 Cash 695.5 695.5 510.3 510.3 478.2 498.7 390.5 403.2 88 Annual report and accounts 05 23 Financial instruments continued As described above, in the current year the Group used options to hedge its future exposure to US dollar rates and Jet A1 fuel costs.
Changes in the fair value of these instruments are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged positions mature.
The variable rate interest terms on the bank loans are agreed on an arms length basis and, therefore, the fair value of those loans approximate to their book values.
The fair value of the bank loans that are subject to fixed rate interest terms is not considered to be materially different from their book value on the basis that the period over which the interest terms are fixed is relatively short and that the fixed interest terms are agreed on an arms length basis.
The fair value of cash approximates to its book value in most cases due to its immediate availability.
For cash that is subject to restrictions, the cash attracts variable rate interest, and therefore the fair value approximates to its book value.
In respect of the US dollar exchange rate, at 30 September 2005 the Group had currency hedges through options and forwards of $1.1 billion, $747 million of which will expire before 30 September 2006.
At 30 September 2005, the total value of these instruments was a gain of 10.2 million.
2004: there was a loss of 1.0 million on hedging instruments.
In respect of fuel, the Group had hedges for 206,000 tonnes of fuel through options at 30 September 2005.
These all expire before 30 September 2006.
At 30 September 2005, the total value of these instruments was a gain of 10.3 million.
2004: there was a gain of 13.7 million on hedging instruments.
There were no further hedges outstanding at 30 September 2005 2004: none.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on financial instruments are as follows: Net Gains Losses gains losses million million million At 1 October 2004 13.7 1.0 12.7 Gains losses arising before 1 October 2004 that were recognised during the year ended 30 September 2005 13.7 1.0 12.7 Gains losses arising in the year that were not recognised during the year ended 30 September 2005 20.5 20.5 Gains at 30 September 2005 20.5 20.5 Of which: Gains expected to be recognised in less than one year 17.8 17.8 Gains expected to be recognised after more than one year 2.7 2.7 Gains at 30 September 2005 20.5 20.5 Annual report and accounts 05 89
