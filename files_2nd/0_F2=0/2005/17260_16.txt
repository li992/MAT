Environmental and legal liabilities include known and potential legal claims and environmental liabilities arising from past events where it is probable that a payment will be made and the amount of such payment can be reasonably estimated.
Included in this provision is an amount of 31.7 million 2004: 27.9 million related to asbestos litigation involving certain Group companies.
This liability is fully covered by insurance and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in Other debtors note 13 in line with FRS 12 Provisions, contingencies and contingent assets.
The liability has been determined as at 31 July 2005 based on advice from independent professional actuarial advisors.
The provision and the related receivable have been stated on a discounted basis using a long-term US treasury rate of 4.5% 2004: 5%.
The level of insurance cover available significantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
Other provisions principally comprise provisions for terminal dilapidations on property leases and provisions for future rents payable net of rents receivable on onerous and vacant property leases.
At 31 July 2005 the Company had provisions of nil 2004: nil.

The loans and other borrowings payable after one year generally attract variable interest rates based on 6 month LIBOR.
Thus the fair value of these instruments as at 31 July 2005 also approximates to their book value.
The fair value of construction loans receivable approximates to book value as the interest rates attaching to these loans reflect a market risk premium.
Sterling cash and deposits are utilised to reduce currency borrowings through the use of short-term currency swaps.
To determine the fair value of currency and interest rate swaps for inclusion in the above table, a calculation was made of the net gain or loss which would have arisen if these contracts had been terminated on 31 July 2005.

Pensions and other post retirement benefits United Kingdom The principal plan operated for UK employees is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The plans retirement benefits are funded by a contribution from employees with the balance being paid by Group companies.
The contribution rates paid by employees at 31 July 2005 are either 5% or 6% of earnings depending upon the level of benefits they were accruing at that date.
The Group and employee contribution rates are calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent consulting actuary.
An independent actuarial valuation was last carried out on 1 May 2004.
On that date the market value of the plans assets was 334.3 million.
The market value of the assets was 74% of accrued benefits, after allowing for increases in earnings and pensions in payment.
The normal cost to the Company and the contribution rate for the year ending 31 July 2006 is 17.2% of pensionable earnings in respect of those employees accruing benefits based on 60ths.
The financial assumptions used were based on gilt and bond yields as at the valuation date.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were an investment return of 6.5% per annum before retirement, an investment return of 5.25% per annum after retirement, future salary increases of 4% per annum plus an additional promotional salary scale, and increases to pensions in payment of 2.25% per annum.
The actuarial valuation also assumes that mortality will be in line with nationally published PMA92 and PFA92 mortality tables incorporating projected improvements to life expectancy to 2010 current pensioners and 2020 non-retired members.
The total charge to the profit and loss account for UK companies was 17.0 million 2004: 13.5 million.
North America The principal plans operated for US employees are defined contribution schemes, details of which are set out below.
In addition, the Group operates three defined benefit schemes in the United States.
In Canada a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme are operated.
The majority of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies.
Defined contribution plans Defined contribution plans are established in accordance with US 401 k rules.
Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit sharing plans.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they fall due.
In the year to 31 July 2005 the cost of defined contribution plans charged to the profit and loss account was 17.7 million 2004: 14.3 million.
Defined benefit plans Defined benefit plans are operated by three US subsidiary undertakings and Wolseley Canada.
Two of the US plans and the Canadian plan are funded.
Two plans are closed to new entrants.
The closed plans now provide a minimum pension guarantee in conjunction with a defined contribution plan.
No further funding by Group companies is required.
The remaining plans provide benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit Credit Method as agreed with independent consulting actuaries.
The independent actuaries have reported on the assets and liabilities of the plans at 31 July 2004.
The principal actuarial assumptions were based upon investment returns of 7.7% and future salary increases of 2%.
The obligations are discounted at 6.4%.
The fair value of the assets of the funded plans amounted to 52.5 million.
The market value of the assets was 87.5% of the accrued benefits.
Surpluses and deficits revealed by the valuation are being amortised over the expected remaining service lives of members.
The total profit and loss account charge for North American schemes was 1.8 million 2004: 3.1 million.
Other territories Both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes are operated.
Liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes are calculated in accordance with actuarial advice.
Full provision is made for such liabilities in these accounts.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are accounted for in the period in which they fall due.
The cost of other defined contribution and defined benefit schemes charged to the profit and loss account was 6.4 million 2004: 4.5 million.
Post retirement health care There are no material obligations to provide post retirement health care benefits.

Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 July 2005.
Non-UK schemes have been aggregated and weighted averages applied.

At 31 July 2005 this was equivalent to an overall increase of 1.5% per annum.
