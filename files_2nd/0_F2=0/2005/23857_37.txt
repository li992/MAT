FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The investment objective of the Company is detailed in the Objective & Highlights on page 1.
In pursuit of this objective, the Company may be exposed to various forms of risk, as described below.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations Euro borrowings to finance operations The risks arising from the Company's financial instruments are market price risk, which comprises interest rate risk and foreign currency exposure, liquidity risk and counterparty credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Page 38 Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2005 Notes to the Financial Statements Short term debtors and other short term creditors are excluded from the following analyses.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Company's business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
The Board meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are stated in the balance sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values.
As explained in Note 1 investments are now shown at fair value which is interpretated to be bid price.
In the case of cash, book value approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.
The exceptions are the long term fixed rate unsecured loans, whose fair values as at 31 December 2005 given below, have been calculated by discounting future cash flow at current euro interest rates.
2005 2004 fair value book value fair value book value 000 000 000 000 Fixed rate unsecured loan @ 3.23% per annum 27,544 27,491 Fixed rate unsecured loan @ 3.54% per annum 24,303 24,055 Fixed rate unsecured loan @ 4.96% per annum 35,012 34,364 36,901 35,310 Fixed rate unsecured loan @ 5.54% per annum 28,161 27,491 29,839 28,249 115,020 113,401 66,740 63,559 Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, financing has been obtained through four euro denominated fixed rate unsecured bank loans, which fall due for repayment on 29 December 2006 two loans, 24 November 2008 and 22 June 2010.
The Company is therefore not exposed to a financial risk arising as a result of any increase in euro interest rates on these loans.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions.
The Company's financial assets are mainly invested in equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date.
The Company also has cash balances invested at short term market interest rates which therefore carry no material risk.
The interest profile of the Companys financial liabilities excluding short term creditors, as at 31 December 2005 and 2004 was as follows: 2005 2004 weighted weighted average average fixed rate weighted period fixed rate weighted period financial average for which financial average for which liabilities interest rate rate is fixed liabilities interest rate rate is fixed 000 000 Currency Euro 113,401 4.38% 27 months 63,559 5.22% 24 months Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2005 Page 39 Notes to the Financial Statements Foreign currency risk The Companys total return and balance sheet can be affected by foreign exchange movements because the Company has assets and income which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys base currency sterling.
The Board has identified three principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affecting the value of investments and loans Movements in rates affecting short term timing differences Movements in rates affecting the income received The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments or other net assets priced in other currencies by the use of derivatives.
However, it has increased finance available to the Company for its investment activities with foreign currency borrowings, thereby hedging part of the movements which are a result of exchange movements.
The Company might also be subject to short term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
Short term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
Details of the Companys borrowing commitments are explained in Note 12.
