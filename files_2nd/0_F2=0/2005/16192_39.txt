Notes to the Financial Statements continued Note 17.
Derivative Financial Investments continued Gas Hedges continued The Groups gas hedges have been assessed to be highly effective within the range prescribed under IAS39 using ratio analysis.
There is however a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups gas hedges arising from, among other factors, field production performance on any day.
On this basis an unrealised loss of 20.3 million has been taken directly to equity, with an associated deferred tax credit of 12.6 million also being recorded on the Balance Sheet.
A change in time value in relation to the gas hedges has resulted in a gain of 2.4 million, with an associated tax charge of 1.0 million, which have been recognised in the Income Statement in the current period.
