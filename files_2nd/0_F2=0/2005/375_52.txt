First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards This is the first year that the Group has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The following disclosures are required in the year of transition.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The date of transition to IFRS was therefore 1 January 2004.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the revised accounting policies set out in note 1 above.
These policies have been revised from those published in the Groups 2004 Report and Accounts following the Groups transition to reporting under IFRS.
The following notes and reconciliations provide an explanation of the impact of the transition to IFRS.
First-time adoption of IFRS The rules for first-time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
The Group is required to establish its IFRS accounting policies which it will use to prepare its results for the year to 31 December 2005 and, in general, apply these retrospectively to determine its opening balance sheet under IFRS at 1 January 2004, the date of transition.
The standard permits certain optional exemptions from this general principle.
The Group has elected to take the following principal exemptions and the information presented has been prepared on this basis.
Business combinations prior to the date of transition IFRS 3, Business Combinations The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations which occurred prior to the date of transition.
Share-based payments IFRS 2, Share-based Payment The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2 to all relevant share-based payment transactions granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005.
Employee benefits IAS19, Employee Benefits The Group has elected to take the exemption available within IAS 19 and has eliminated unrecognised actuarial gains and losses by setting them off against equity in the opening IFRS balance sheet.
Financial instruments IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement The Group has elected to apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005.
Therefore the comparative financial information in respect of financial instruments is presented in accordance with UK GAAP as applicable in 2004.
The implementation of IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005 has resulted in an adjustment to the carrying value of the Groups convertible bond, mark to market adjustments in respect of financial instruments and the recognition of financial liabilities including put options.
Cumulative translation differences The Group has elected that all cumulative translation differences arising from the retranslation of overseas subsidiaries are re-set to zero at the date of transition, 1 January 2004.

Further details are provided in note 3.

First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards continued Notes to IFRS adjustments a IFRS 3 Business combinations - Goodwill Under IFRS goodwill is not amortised.
IFRS 3, Business Combinations requires that goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews.
As the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations which occurred prior to 1 January 2004, the UK GAAP goodwill balance at 31 December 2003 after recognising an incremental IFRS impairment charge has been included in the opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004.
As a result, goodwill amortisation charged to the income statement in 2004 has been added back to profits.
The Group has also conducted an impairment review of goodwill at 1 January 2004 in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
This review has resulted in an opening IFRS impairment charge on goodwill of 15.8m.
Under UK GAAP, where no indicator of impairment was apparent to management, no review was required to be performed.
Under IFRS an impairment review is required of all goodwill balances regardless of whether or not an indication of impairment is apparent.
The recoverable amounts used in this review were based on value-in-use calculations.
Cash flow projections were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 12.75%.
Negative goodwill of 0.5 million, recognised under UK GAAP, has been reversed on transition to IFRS as an adjustment to the balance sheet at 1 January 2004. b IFRS 2 Share-based payment IFRS 2, Share-based payment, requires the fair value of share-based payments principally share options and other share-based incentive schemes to be recognised as an expense in the income statement, spread over the vesting period of the relevant scheme typically three years.
There was no charge in the income statement in respect of share options under UK GAAP as all options were issued at an exercise price equivalent to the market price at that date.
The 2004 UK GAAP results did include a charge in respect of other share-based incentive schemes.
Neither cash nor distributable reserves are impacted by this change in accounting for share based incentive schemes.
"c IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date - Dividends IAS 10, Events after the Balance Sheet Date requires that dividends declared after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a liability at that balance sheet date as the liability does not represent a present obligation as defined by IAS 37, ""Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets""."
The impact on retained profit for 2004 is to exclude the final proposed dividend for 2004 of 9.8 million as this was declared in 2005.
However, the final proposed dividend for 2003 of 8.9 million which was declared in 2004 is now included as a distribution of profit for 2004. d IAS 19 Employee benefits Under IAS 19, all accumulating employee-compensated absences that are unused at the balance sheet date must be recognised as a liability.
There is no similar requirement under UK GAAP.
In addition, employee benefits which fall within the scope of IAS 19 have been recognised in the Groups balance sheet.
e Other Other adjustments have been made in respect of IAS 12 Income taxes, IAS 17 Leases and IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements.
In addition, certain reclassifications have been performed, including reclassifying bank charges from finance costs to operating expenses, and reclassifying certain items between the account captions within trade and other receivables.
