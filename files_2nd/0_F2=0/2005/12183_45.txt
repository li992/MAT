29 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES CONTINUED c Minority interests in German subsidiary undertakings In 1989 Pilkington Holding GmbH formerly Pilkington Deutschland GmbH made an offer to acquire the minority interests in Pilkington Deutschland AG formerly Flachglas AG and Dahlbusch AG.
If the remaining minority shareholders in these companies as at 31st March 2005 accept such an offer, the cost will be 37 million 25 million in addition to the 143 million 98 million paid to those who accepted the offer prior to 31st March 2005.
Certain minority shareholders have legally challenged the offer as insuffcient.
In the case related to Pilkington Deutschland AG, the court has decided that the offer price should be increased from 295 per 26 share to 43 350.
The effect of this decision is to increase the amount payable to those shareholders of Pilkington Deutschland AG, who have already accepted the offer to purchase, by 9 million 6 million, and to increase the amount payable to the remaining minority shareholders by 6 million 4 million.
As the proceedings are ongoing since 1989, additional interest amounting to 18 million 12 million would become payable.
The court also decided that the guaranteed dividend, which was an alternative offered by Pilkington Holding GmbH to the minority shareholders, should not be increased.
The decision of the court is being appealed by Pilkington Holding GmbH and the minority shareholders and, having had a first court hearing in November 2004, it is expected that there will be no decision by the appeal court before September 2005.
The court dealing with the Dahlbusch AG case has not yet issued its judgement.
A court appointed valuer has proposed an increase in the offer price of approximately 19 per cent and an increase in the guaranteed dividend of approximately 14 per cent.
These valuation opinions do not constitute rulings and are not binding on the court, which has asked the parties to review and comment on them.
Indeed, similar opinions were presented in the Pilkington Deutschland AG case, and rejected by the court in that case.
The court in this case will await the final decision in the Pilkington Holding GmbH case and thus is unlikely to issue its decision before the beginning of 2006.
Any such decision would be capable of being the subject of an appeal.
d European Union investigation On 24th February 2005 the European Commission announced an investigation into the flat and car glass sectors of the European glass manufacturing industry in connection with alleged infringements of Article 81 of the Treaty of Rome, the maximum penalty for which, if established, can be a fine of up to ten per cent of worldwide turnover.
In the course of that investigation the Commission has carried out inspections at the premises of several glass manufacturers, including Pilkington.
Pilkington has operated a competition law compliance programme for a number of years and is cooperating with the Commissions investigation.
The investigation is at a very preliminary stage and the outcome cannot yet be assessed.
e Other guarantees and contingent liabilities At 31st March 2005 the Group has guaranteed, in the ordinary course of business, bank loans of nil to third parties 2004 4 million and 10 million 2004 8 million in respect of joint ventures.
The Group had other contingent liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business arising out of guarantees and other transactions, some of which are the subject of litigation.
In the opinion of the directors, the outcome of such litigation will not have a material effect on the Groups consolidated financial position.
