22 Pensions The Group accounts for pension costs in accordance with IAS 19.
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The funds of the principal schemes are administered by trustees and are held independently from the Group.
Pension costs of defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Full triennial actuarial valuations were carried out on the principal European defined benefit schemes in April 2003 and annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice, local conditions and practices.
The most recent actuarial valuations have incorporated the requirements of IAS 19 in assessing scheme liabilities at 31 December 2005.
Scheme assets for the purpose of IAS 19 are stated at their bid value.
The amounts included in the financial statements are as follows: 2005 2004 Amounts charged to income statement Group m m Defined contribution schemes 7.0 8.6 Defined benefit schemes service cost 6.2 7.4 Total operating charge 13.2 16.0 Amounts included as other finance costs Expected return on pension scheme assets 13.5 16.0 Interest charge on pension scheme liabilities 13.5 16.6 Net financial return 0.6 Total charge 13.2 16.6 Bunzl plc Directors Report and Accounts 2005 25 Notes continued 22 Pensions continued 2005 2004 Amounts recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense m m Actual return less expected return on scheme assets 15.8 7.8 Experience gain loss on scheme liabilities 0.4 3.6 Impact of changes in assumptions relating to the present value of scheme liabilities 43.5 17.5 Actuarial loss recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense 27.3 13.3 The cumulative amount of actuarial losses recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense at the end of the year was 40.6m 2004: 13.3m.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries for the purposes of IAS 19 were: Europe 2005 2004 Longevity at age 65 for current pensioners years 18.5 17.5 Longevity at age 65 for future pensioners years 20.0 19.0 The mortality assumptions used by the actuaries for the US pension schemes have been taken from Group Annuity Mortality tables.
