10697 Capita 2005 back 14 3 06 09:54 Page 85 85 Capita Notes to the consolidated financial statements 27 Share based payment plans continued The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a multiple simulation option pricing valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the years ended 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004.
2005 2004 Dividend yield % 1.5 1.6 Expected share price volatility % 37.80 40.0 Historical volatility % 37.80 40.0 Risk-free interest rate % 4.5 4.5 Expected life of option years 4.49 4.45 Weighted average share price 3.78 3.12 The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
No other features of options grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.

Share premium The amount paid to a company by shareholders, in cash or other consideration, over and above the nominal value of shares issued to them.
Treasury shares Stock that has been bought back by the issuing corporation and is available for retirement or resale: it is issued but not outstanding: it cannot vote and pays no dividends.
Capital redemption reserve A company can redeem shares which are issued as redeemable shares by repaying the nominal value to the shareholder, whereupon the shares are cancelled.
Redemption must normally be from distributable profits, but a procedure exists to allow shares to be redeemed from capital.
As this amounts to a reduction of capital, an amount equivalent to the reduction of issued capital may need to be transferred to a capital redemption reserve.
Merger reserve A capital reserve appearing in the consolidated balance sheet for a group of companies arising where the value of the underlying assets acquired exceeds the value of the consideration given for them.
Foreign currency translation Gains or losses resulting from the process of expressing amounts denominated or measured in one currency in terms of another currency by use of the exchange rate between the two currencies.
This process is generally required to consolidate the financial statements of foreign afliates into the total company financial statements and to recognise the conversion of foreign currency or the settlement of a receivable or payable denominated in foreign currency at a rate different from that at which the item is recorded.
Translation adjustments are not included in determining net income, but are disclosed as separate components of consolidated equity.
Retained earnings Net profits kept to accumulate in an enterprise after dividends are paid: retained in the business as working capital.
