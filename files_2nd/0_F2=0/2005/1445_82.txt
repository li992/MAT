During 2005, $6,056m of the profit was realised by repayment.
Subsequent to the year end, a further $587m was repaid on 26 January 2006, resulting in additional distributable reserves not included in the figures above.
Included in other reserves is a special reserve of $157m, arising on the redenomination of share capital in 1999.
