NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2005 1.
General information United Business Media plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is Ludgate House, 245 Blackfriars Road, London SE1 9UY.
The nature of the groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 3.
The groups financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 were authorised for issue on behalf of the board of directors on 28 February 2006 and the balance sheet was signed off on the boards behalf by David Levin and Nigel Wilson.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest 0.1m.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted in the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 37.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.
Basis of consolidation a Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of UBM plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 December each year.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared to the same reporting date as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the group.
The group uses the purchase method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
b Associates The groups investments in its associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
These are entities in which the group has the ability to exert significant influence and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures.
The financial statements of the associates are used by the group to apply the equity method.
The reporting dates of the associates and the group are identical and the accounts are prepared on the basis of consistent accounting policies.
Under the equity method, the income statement reflects the share of the results of operations of the associates.
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the associates equity, the group recognises its share of any changes.
When the groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceed its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
c Joint ventures The groups interests in its joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

Significant accounting policies continued Changes in accounting policies In 2005 the group has adopted IFRS for the first time.
Previously the group reported under UK generally accepted accounting principles UK GAAP.
The group has applied IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting and Accounting Standards to provide a starting point for reporting under IFRS.
The date of transition to IFRS is 1 January 2004 and all information in these financial statements has been restated to reflect the groups adoption of IFRS.
The adoption of IFRS has resulted in the following principal changes to the groups accounting policies: IFRS 2 Share-based Payment IFRS 2 Share-based Payment requires an expense to be recognised where the group buys goods or services in exchange for shares or rights over shares, or in exchange for other assets equivalent in value to a given number of shares or rights over shares.
The main impact of IFRS 2 on the group is the expensing of employees and directors share options and other share-based incentives by using an option-pricing model to calculate the fair value at date of grant.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IAS 36 Impairment of Assets and IAS 38 Intangible Assets The group has adopted the exemption in IFRS 1 to apply IFRS 3 only to acquisitions after 31 March 2004.
On acquisition, the group measures the identifiable assets and liabilities of acquired entities at their fair values at the acquisition date.
This includes intangible assets which would not be capitalised had they been internally developed.
Under IFRS, more intangible assets will be recognised separately from goodwill.
The adoption of IFRS has resulted in the group ceasing goodwill amortisation from 1 January 2004 and instead testing for impairment at the level of the cash generating unit or group of cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated, annually and whenever there are indications of impairment.
The useful lives of intangible assets other than goodwill are assessed at the individual asset level.
Where an intangible asset has a finite life, it is amortised over its useful life.
Amortisation periods and methods for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed annually.
The group has reassessed the useful lives of its intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of IAS 38.
No adjustment resulted from this reassessment.
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations IFRS 5 requires an item to be classified as held for sale if its carrying value will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use.
In addition, a component of an entity is classified as discontinued when the criteria to be classified as held for sale have been met or it has been disposed of and it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
The adoption of IFRS 5 has resulted in the profit from discontinued operations being disclosed as a single line on the face of the income statement comprising the profit after tax for the discontinued operations prior to disposal along with the related profit on disposal.
The comparative period has been restated accordingly.
The group has adopted IFRS 5 from 1 January 2004.
This resulted in 5.1 million of tangible assets reclassified as held for sale as at 31 December 2004.
IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts Under IAS 18, the recognition of revenue on service contracts should follow the principles in IAS 11.
Under IAS 11, the stage of completion method must be adopted for the recognition of revenue and expenditure on contracts where as under UK GAAP recognition on a completed project basis is acceptable.
IAS 12 Income Taxes Under IFRS, the basis for recording deferred tax moves to a balance sheet liability method.
Under IAS 12, a deferred tax liability is recognised on the difference between the balance sheet amount of intangible assets acquired as part of the groups acquisitions and the tax base of the intangible assets.
p. 47 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2005 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Changes in accounting policies continued IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement requires that assets and liabilities are all classified into one of five categories, which dictates the accounting treatment.
Items are measured either at fair value, or at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The group has adopted the exemption to implement IAS 32 and 39 from 1 January 2005, and has not restated its 2004 results.
The main impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on the group is to record the movement in fair values through the income statement for all derivatives.
The embedded derivatives within the credit link notes and the convertible bond are both required to be at fair value on transition.
IAS 39 specifies three types of hedging relationships: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, and hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
IAS 39 requires all hedges to be formally documented on transition, explaining the hedging relationship and the objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
The hedge must be expected to be highly effective, and effectiveness must be able to be reliably measured.
The group is applying hedge accounting for its hedges that qualify under IAS 39 on transition.
For qualifying cash flow hedges and hedges of a net investment, the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is deferred in equity to the extent the hedge is effective.
Accumulated fair value changes from qualifying hedges are released from equity to the profit and loss account in the period when the hedged cash flow effects the profit and loss account for cash flow hedges or on disposal of the foreign operation for hedges of net investments.
For qualifying fair value hedges the carrying value of recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged items are otherwise carried at cost and adjusted to record changes in fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged.
All gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation requires convertible bonds denominated in a foreign currency to be split into the debt component and the component representing the embedded derivatives in the bond.
IAS 39 requires the debt component to be measured at amortised cost, and the embedded derivatives to be measured at fair value with movements reported in the income statement.
The groups convertible bond is denominated in US Dollars, so must be split into its relevant debt and derivative components and measured accordingly.
The impact of accounting for the convertible bond in this way, in accordance with current IFRS interpretation, from 1 January 2005 compared to UK GAAP is to: increase finance cost other than interest in the income statement: reduce the debt component of the bonds: and introduce volatility to the income statement through the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives.
Adoption of new standards and amendments The group has adopted the amended versions of IAS 17 Leases and IAS 19 Employee Benefits, revised in 2004.
The group has decided not to adopt IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure early.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements but would be relevant for the group, were in issue but were not yet effective.
The date by which application is required is given in brackets.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures 1 January 2006 IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease 1 January 2006 The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when the relevant standards come into effect for the periods commencing on or after 1 January 2006.
Segment reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products of services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
p. 48 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2005 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Revenue Revenue comprises the fair value of sale of goods and services, net of trade discounts, VAT, other sales related taxes, and after eliminated sales within the group.
Revenue is recognised as follows: a Sale of goods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
b Sales of services Revenue is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered, with reference to completion of the specific transaction assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided.
Publishing: advertising revenue is recognised on issue of the publication.
Revenue from subscriptions is recognised over the life of the subscription.
Exhibitions: revenue is recognised when the show has been completed.
Deposits received in advance are recorded as deferred income in the balance sheet.
News distribution: revenue is recognised on message delivery.
Directories: revenue is recognised on the issue or sale of the directory.
Online: revenue is recognised at the point of delivery fulfilment, or over the life of subscriptions.
Market research: revenue is recognised on a stage of completion basis based on the percentage of costs incurred.
Work in progress amounts are recorded in the balance sheet at cost.
Syndicated revenues are recognised on completion and any subsequent sales are recognised as they arise.
Consulting revenues are recognised on a time-incurred basis.
The market research business was disposed of in 2005, and market research revenue is included as part of discontinued operations.
Interest and other income a Interest income Revenue is recognised as the interest accrues using the effective interest rate method to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
b Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive the payment is established.
c Rental income Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease terms on ongoing leases.
Goodwill and intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirers interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment is recognised.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit are disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
p. 49 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2005 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Goodwill and intangible assets continued b Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and from a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, the cost model is applied to the class of intangible assets.
The useful lives of these intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets created within the business are not capitalised and expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Software costs are written off as incurred.
Purchases from third parties in respect of major systems are capitalised and written off over the expected useful of the asset, not exceeding five years from the date of implementation of the software.
Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable, either individually or at the cash generating unit level.
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable are made on a prospective basis.
Separable intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives.
A summary of the policies applied to the groups intangible assets is as follows: Useful Lives Method Brands Finite 10 years straight line Software Finite 5 years straight line Customer contracts and relationships Finite 4-5 years straight line Subscription lists Finite 5 years straight line Trademarks Finite 10 years straight line Databases Finite 5 years straight line Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is provided on all such fixed assets except freehold land.
Depreciation rates are calculated so that assets are written down to residual value in equal annual instalments over their expected useful lives, which are as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold property Up to 70 years Leasehold improvements Term of lease General plant, machinery and equipment 5-20 years Computer equipment 3-5 years Motor vehicles 3-5 years Impairment of assets Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For purposes of assessing impairment, assets that do not individually generate cash flows are assessed as part of the cash generating unit to which they belong.
Cash generating units are the lowest levels for which there are cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets.
Inventories Inventories and work in progress are valued on the first in first out basis at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises materials, direct labour and directly attributable production costs and overheads.
Operating leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Group as a lessee Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Group as a lessor Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same bases as rental income.
p. 50 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2005 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30-90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, deposits and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts which are shown within borrowings.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, as appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the income statement, except where hedge accounting is applied and for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the groups net investment in a foreign operation.
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates for the year.
The resulting exchange differences are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
Pension costs The group sponsors a number of defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes.
These schemes are accounted for under IAS 19.
The group has adopted the amended version of IAS 19 early, which permits recognition of actuarial gains and losses in equity through the Consolidated Statement of Group Total Recognised Income and Expense.
For the defined contribution schemes, the income statement charge represents the contributions payable to the scheme during the accounting period.
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the assets are measured at their market value at the balance sheet date and the liabilities of those schemes are measured using the projected unit credit method.
The discount rate used is the current rate of return on an AA corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liabilities.
The extent to which the schemes' assets exceed or fall short of their liabilities is shown as a surplus or deficit in the balance sheet to the extent that a surplus is recoverable by the group or that a deficit represents an obligation of the group.
p. 51 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2005 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Pension costs continued The following is charged to operating profit: the increase in the present value of pension scheme liabilities arising from employee service in the current period: the increase in the present value of pension scheme liabilities as a result of benefit improvements over the period during which such improvements vest: and gains and losses arising on settlements curtailments.
A credit in respect of the expected return on the schemes' assets and a charge in respect of the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes' liabilities because the benefits are one period closer to settlement are shown on the face of the income statement as financing cost pension schemes.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the Consolidated Statement of Group Total Recognised Income and Expense in the period in which they occur.
Share-based payment transactions Employees including directors of the group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by an external valuer using the Black Scholes or Monte Carlo methods as appropriate.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of UBM plc market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the years in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards, in the opinion of the directors of the group at that date, based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
Share capital Ordinary shares Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options, or for the acquisition of a business, are included in the cost of acquisition as part of the purchase consideration.
B shares 23 The groups existing B Shares of 8 and 44 pence each are classified as equity.
Treasury shares Where any group company purchases the Companys equity share capital ESOP shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
p. 52 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2005 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Financial instruments Financial instruments in the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, and in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, after taking account of directly attributable transaction costs.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at cost and then remeasured to fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates for reporting purposes.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market rates of interest.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: or as cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast transactions are recognised directly in equity.
Amounts deferred in this way are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged firm commitments or forecast transactions are recognised in the income statement.
In relation to fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument recognised in equity are retained until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Other investments The group classifies its investments in the following categories: available-for-sale financial assets and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
After initial recognition, investments that are classified as available-for-sale are measured at fair value and loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost.
Interest is accrued using the effective interest rate method.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
a Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Listed and unlisted investments are stated at fair value with gains and losses being recognised in equity, except where there is no market value in an active market and where the fair value cannot be reliably measured, in which case they are measured at cost.
b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
These are classified as non-current assets.
p. 53 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2005 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Convertible bonds The convertible bond is split into two components: a debt component and a component representing the embedded derivatives in the bond.
The debt component represents the groups liability for future interest coupon payments and the redemption amount.
The embedded derivatives represent the value of the option that bondholders have to convert into ordinary shares of the company.
The debt component of the convertible bond is measured at amortised cost and therefore increases as the present value of the interest coupon payments and redemption amount increases, with a corresponding charge to finance cost other than interest.
The debt component decreases by the cash interest coupon payments made.
The embedded derivatives are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date, and the change in the fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowings.
After initial recognition, loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost, and any difference between the proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets A financial asset is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: the group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: or the group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from the asset either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Where the group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the groups continuing involvement in the asset.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the group could be required to pay.
Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written and or purchased option including a cash-settled or similar provision on the transferred asset, the extent of the groups continuing involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that the group may repurchase, except that in the case of a written put option including a cash-settled option or similar provision on an asset measured at fair value, the extent of the groups continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option exercise price.
Financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as derecognition of the original liability and recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.

These guidelines identify a number of categories of work where the auditors will not normally be employed, including financial due diligence assignments on potential acquisitions and financial systems consultancy.
The Audit Committee has also put in place procedures for the preapproval of any fees payable to the auditors for those non-audit services which fall within the policy guidelines.
Professional firms are selected to provide advisory services on the basis of their relevant experience and expertise.
For major projects, it is the groups policy to undertake a competitive tendering process.
In certain circumstances, for example for reasons of confidentiality or knowledge of the groups businesses and structures, it is appropriate to employ the groups auditors to provide such services without a competitive tender being undertaken.

The objectives of these projects are to simplify the group structure following the disposals of businesses in 2005, to achieve greater geographical alignment of our publishing divisions and to achieve greater customer and product focus within our operating businesses whilst delivering lower operating costs.
The total cost of the projects is 37.2 million, which has been charged separately as a one off cost in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2005.
As indicated in the analysis above, the nature of the costs incurred is principally redundancy, vacant space provisions arising from relocation and consolidation, the re-engineering of business processes and the costs of restructuring and business reorganisation.
In addition, acquisition integration costs of 1.6 million were incurred during the year.
Of the amount charged, 7.2 million was incurred during 2005.
With the exception of amounts relating to vacant property, which will be incurred across the remainder of the unexpired lease terms, the balance of the costs is expected to be paid in 2006.
In 2004, the group had written down the carrying value of certain fixed asset investments by 11.7 million to reflect their expected realisable value.
The group also resolved a number of outstanding items as a consequence of which there was a net exceptional tax credit of 121.0 million.

The majority of this gain arose from the strengthening of the US Dollar in the first half of 2005. b Accounting standards determine that UBMs US Dollar convertible bond contains an embedded derivative, and this option is carried at fair value with changes taken to the income statement.
This charge is a result of the increase in UBMs share price.
The non-recurring fair value loss on the embedded derivative of 2.2 million relates to the portion of the bond that was repurchased during the year.
c In the second half of 2005, UBM repurchased $234.6 million of the principal of the US Dollar convertible bond, and $179.3 million of the principal of the US dollar fixed rate unsecured notes.
This charge reflects the premium paid and fees relating to these repurchases, and unamortised costs being written off.
d The convertible bond is separated into fixed rate debt and an equity derivative.
This charge reflects the accretion of the debt to the value at maturity.

The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised amount in aggregate to 1.8 billion 2004: 1.6 billion.
There are no income tax consequences to the group attaching to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.
2005 2004 m m The movement in the net deferred tax liability was as follows: Net liability at 1 January 16.8 Acquisition of subsidiaries note 30 10.7 16.3 Amounts charged to net profit 3.2 0.5 Exchange differences 0.3 1.0 Net liability at 31 December 24.0 16.8 The group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of 55.2 million relating to deductible temporary differences and 49.6 million relating to unused tax losses 2004: 47.1 million and 38.5 million respectively.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these amounts due to the unpredictability of future taxable profit streams.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders after deducting interest on the convertible bond by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year adjusted for the effects of dilutive options and dilutive convertible bond.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated on the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity shareholders, less non-recurring items and deferred tax, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Non-recurring items and deferred tax are excluded from this calculation, as due to their nature and the infrequency of the events giving rise to them, separate presentation allows shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance for the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better the trends of financial performance.

Earnings per share continued The group has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys ordinary shares during the year, and shares attributable to convertible debt.
The impact of dilutive securities in 2005 would be to increase the profit by 19.1 million 2004: 3.5 million for convertible debt and to increase weighted average shares by 3.3 million shares 2004: 4.6 million shares for employee share options and 40.4 million shares 2004: 47.8 million shares for convertible debt.
The weighted average number of shares excludes ordinary shares held by the ESOP and the QUEST.

Goodwill continued Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units CGUs identified according to business segment.
However, the Market Research entities subsequently disposed of are also identified on a geographical basis, to align with the reporting and organisational structure.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
A segment-level summary of the goodwill allocation is shown as follows: 2005 2004 m m CMP Media 203.5 161.2 CMPMedica 182.7 159.7 CMP Asia 12.6 11.8 CMP Information 177.2 145.2 News Distribution 14.6 13.2 Market Research UK 6.7 Market Research US 65.5 Market Research Europe 20.5 590.6 583.8 Management tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indicators that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the fair value less costs to sell of the CGU.
The fair value is based on the best information available, and refers to the amount at which the CGU could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties.
The valuation methods are based on an earnings multiple based approach.
The earnings multiple based approach uses precedent transaction multiples, obtained from comparable businesses in the publishing and media sector.
The group uses external advisors to calculate the fair value less costs to sell of its CGUs.
Management does not re-compute the fair value of each CGU annually if all of the following criteria are met: The components of the CGU have not changed since the last fair value calculation: The previous fair value amount exceeded the carrying amount of the CGU by a substantial margin: No evidence exists to indicate that the current fair value of the CGU would be less than its current carrying amount.

Financial instruments Objectives, policies and procedures The groups treasury department manages the groups funding, liquidity and exposure to currency and interest rate risk.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised by the Board and are subject to internal control procedures.
The objective of the framework is to provide flexibility whilst minimising risk and prohibiting speculative transactions or positions to be taken.
The groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans and overdraft, the convertible bond, and cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the groups operations.
The group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The group also enters into derivative transactions, including principally interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the groups operations and its sources of finance.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk.
The board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and they are summarised below.
The groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in note 2.
Further detail on policies for managing funding requirements, investment of surplus funds and management of risks can be found in the Financial Review.
Cash flow interest rate risk The groups exposure to risk for changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the groups debt obligations and the groups cash and cash equivalents.
The groups policy is to manage interest exposure using a mix of fixed and variable debt instruments, floating rate cash and derivatives.
The group aims at balancing the estimated running cost of borrowing and investing and the risk of significant impact on earnings.
At 31 December 2005, after the impact of interest rate swaps, 100% of the groups borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest.
At 31 December, after the impact of interest rate swaps, approximately 60% of the groups cash and cash equivalents are at a fixed rate of interest.
The swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
Foreign currency risk The group has significant operations in the US and Europe.
Prior to 2005 the group looked to mitigate the effect foreign currency translation had on the group balance sheet by borrowing in US dollars as well as euro.
Following asset disposals in 2005, the group repaid the majority of the US dollar borrowing held for this purpose from the cash received.
With regards to euro operations, the group mitigates the effect of its balance sheet currency exposure by borrowing in euro.
Approximately 75% of the groups investments in euro operations are hedged in this way.
The group does not currently have material transactional currency exposures.
Where such exposures do arise they are from sales or purchases by operating divisions in currencies other than the divisions functional currency.
The group requires all of its operating divisions to use forward foreign exchange contracts to eliminate the currency exposures on any firm commitment for sale or purchases on individual transactions in excess of 50,000.
At the end of 2005 the group had hedged 0.5m of foreign currency transactions from January to September 2006.
Commodity price risk The groups exposure to price risk is minimal.
The group is exposed to movements in the raw material prices of paper, oil, and postage.
Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
With respect to credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents, and certain derivatives, the groups exposure arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
The group uses a number of major banks and financial institutions with investment decisions based on the creditworthiness of the counterparty.
Liquidity risk The group guarantees sufficient liquidity at all times by efficient cash management by placing surplus funds in short term liquid investments.
The group also maintains flexibility by keeping committed and uncommitted credit lines available.
Committed credit facilities total 325 million.

Market values obtained from third parties have been used to determine the fair value of interest rate swaps, credit linked notes, forward foreign contracts, the fixed rate convertible bonds and the US dollar senior loan.
The fair value of cash at bank and deposits approximates to their book value due to their short maturity.
Listed investments are valued at market rate.

These levels when modelled with volatility, time to maturity and the issuer soft call at 7.50, enable the value of the option contained within the convertible to be calculated.
The effective interest rate of the convertible bond is 5.07%.
The effect of the groups Euro interest rate swaps is to classify as fixed rate all 138.8 million of the Euro borrowing under the 325 million revolving syndicated facility at a fixed rate.
This debt has been swapped to 2.97% for with a maturity of May 2010.
The group has 300m of interest rate swaps, which are not designated as cash flows hedges.

As stated in the Financial Review, the group has redeemed $75 million of these bonds early in order to reduce the groups net interest exposure.
Additionally, to achieve a higher level of redemption without making a significant early redemption payment, the group has entered into the following transactions that have a similar economic effect to redeeming the bonds.
At 31 December 2004, the group holds $160 million of credit linked notes from a number of counterparties, these notes having similar maturities to the US dollar loan notes.
The notes pay interest at an average rate of LIBOR plus 266 basis points per annum.
In return for paying interest on the credit linked notes at rates in excess of LIBOR, the final redemption to be received by the company is determined by certain circumstances related to the credit risk of the company.
These circumstances arise if there has been a credit event as defined in the terms of the note, in which case the counterparties may redeem the notes at less than par value.
A credit event arises in the event of any of the following circumstances: a bankruptcy of the company: if the group is required by any of its lenders to accelerate repayment of borrowings: if the group fails to make payment under any of its borrowings: if the group restructures any of its borrowings in order to avoid default: and if any of its borrowings are repudiated, disaffirmed or rejected or subject to any moratorium.
If a credit event should take place, the credit linked note may not necessarily be redeemed for cash.
The company may receive its own bonds or debt obligations with a par value equivalent to the amount of the credit linked notes from the counterparties in settlement of redemption of the note.

Financial instruments continued Hedges The groups policy is to hedge interest rate risk using fixed rate borrowings and financial instruments such as interest rate swaps.
Net foreign transaction risks are hedged as they arise, generally using forward foreign exchange contracts, whilst foreign currency borrowings are used to provide an economic hedge against investments in overseas territories.
The groups policy for accounting for hedges can be found in the Group Accounting Policies section of this report.
The tables below show the extent to which the group has unrecognised gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning and end of the year.
All the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions or positions.

Provisions continued Liabilities on property The group has lease obligations in respect of the continuing costs of vacant property, the quantification of which depends upon the ability to exit the leases early or sublet the properties, and for dilapidations on certain leasehold properties which are dependent principally on actual reinstatement costs on expiry of the leases.
The provision in respect of these obligations at 31 December 2005 has been determined following external professional advice and will be utilised over the period of the leases in question, which range from one to 12 years.
The provision is discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, as appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Liabilities arising from former financial services activities A subsidiary of the group was formerly engaged in the selling of personal pensions prior to 1996.
As a result of the industry-wide review into pension misselling by the Personal Investment Authority, the group is exposed to actual and potential future claims by investors in respect of policies found to have been missold.
Although work continues to progress with respect to the identification and review of all pension policies sold, the number and amount of such claims can not be finally determined until all potential compensation costs have been agreed.
The amount of the provisions at 31 December 2005 has been determined on the basis of independent financial advice.
Liabilities for restructuring As discussed in note 7, during 2005 the group implemented a number of restructuring and reorganisation projects.
With the exception of amounts relating to vacant properties see liabilities on property above, the provision is expected to be substantially utilised within one year.
Retirement benefit obligation The group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas.
In 2005, the pension schemes included in the calculations were the United Pension Plan, the United Magazines Final Salary Scheme, the defined benefit section of the United Group Pension Scheme, The Builder Group Pension Scheme, the CMP Media LLC Cash Balance Retirement Plan, the United News Executive Pension Scheme, and the CMP Post Retirement Medical Plan.
Two of these plans were included for the first time in 2004 these are CMPMedica schemes in Australia and France.
The most recent actuarial valuations were carried out at various dates in 2005 and updated to 31 December 2005 by independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: UK Schemes Other Schemes Total UK Schemes Other Schemes Total 2005 2005 2005 2004 2004 2004 m m m m m m Fair value of plan assets 411.2 27.4 438.6 365.3 23.0 388.3 Benefit obligation 453.2 32.2 485.4 449.5 29.8 479.3 42.0 4.8 46.8 84.2 6.8 91.0 Irrecoverable surplus due to IAS 19 para.

The actual return on plan assets was 59.0 million 2004: 30.3 million.
The expected return on plan assets reflects the investments currently held to provide for the pension benefit obligations as at 31 December 2005.
Plan assets chiefly consist of equity instruments and fixed income investments.
The expected rate of return on equities was based on expected long-term out performance of equities over government bonds of 3.5% p. a.
The assumptions used for post retirement mortality in the UK are the mortality tables PA92B1936 for pensioners and PA92B1954 for nonpensioners.
In the US, RP 2000 tables are used.
For UK schemes, the PA92B1936 mortality table indicates an average life expectancy for a 65-year-old male of 20.6 years.
Additional pension contributions of 17.2 million were made to the UK schemes during the year, and additional contributions of 5.0 million are expected to be contributed in 2006.

Share capital continued The return of capital to shareholders undertaken in 2001 took the form of a subdivision and consolidation of the existing United ordinary 23 shares.
On 23 April 2001, each of the existing 507,901,885 ordinary shares of 25 pence then in issue were sub-divided into one share of 8 44 21 21 pence B Shares and one share of 16 44 pence and immediately following such sub-division every issued share of 16 44 pence was sub- 25 25 divided into 29 shares of 44 pence.
Every 44 shares of 44 pence each resulting from such sub-division were then consolidated into one ordinary share of 25 pence.
The subdivision created a class of B shares with a total value of approximately 1.25 billion.
UK shareholders had the option to sell these shares for 245 pence per share, to receive a single dividend of 245 pence per share, or to retain the B shares and receive a continuing dividend.
During the year ended 31 December 2004, 766,030 B shares were purchased by the company for consideration of 1.8 million.
Cumulatively to 31 December 2005, 370,586,767 B shares have been purchased by the company for consideration of 907.9 million.
At 31 December 2005, 4,830,923 B shares remain in issue.
The B shares are irredeemable however, the company has the authority to convert into ordinary shares, at its option, all remaining B shares in issue after 23 April 2011, if the number is less than 125 million.
The conversion into ordinary shares will be based on the market price of ordinary shares at the time of the conversion.
B shares B shareholders are entitled to a non-cumulative preference dividend.
On winding up, the B shareholders are entitled to 245 pence per share and the relevant proportion of the dividends outstanding.
B shareholders do not have any voting entitlements except in a resolution relating to a winding up of the company or if the B share dividend has been outstanding for more than six months.
Share repurchases and consolidation The group repurchased and cancelled 3,010,000 of its own ordinary shares during the year at an average price of 508.3p.
The total amount paid to acquire the ordinary shares was 15.3 million, and 1.5 million was paid to acquire B shares.
On 20 June 2005, in conjunction with the special dividend of 89.0 pence per share, a share consolidation was carried out to convert 17 existing 5 ordinary shares with a nominal value of 25 pence each to 14 new ordinary shares with a nominal value of 30 and 14 pence each.
The share consolidation converted the 337,932,001 existing issued and fully paid ordinary shares into 278,296,942 new issued and fully paid ordinary shares.
The weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of earnings per share reflects the share consolidation refer to note 10.

Share-based payments An Employee Share Ownership Plan the United ESOP was established by the company on 24 June 1996.
The United ESOP has purchased in the open market, UBM shares which are held on trust for employees participating in the plans listed below.
The purchase of shares in the open market is financed through contributions in cash by the company and, for awards under the Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan, through bonuses sacrificed by senior executives.
The group maintains seven share-based payment arrangements: 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme, 2000 Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan, UK Save As You Earn Option Scheme, International Save As You Earn Scheme, Medium Term Incentive Plan, Performance Plan and Bonus Investment Plan.
As at 31 December the holdings over the United ESOP and the QUEST were as follows: Number of Number of UBM shares UBM shares 2005 2004 United ESOP Ordinary shares 1,925,921 2,066,589 B shares 34,918 279,484 QUEST Ordinary shares 216,993 205,060 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme On 18 April 2000 the group established a share option programme for full-time directors and certain employees.
"All participants in the 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme the ""Executive scheme"" must be employed by United Business Media or one of its subsidiaries at the time of granting the options."
The number of options granted to a participant under the Executive scheme is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, being the committee established by the Board of Directors as such.
The number of ordinary shares which may be placed under option under the Executive scheme in any year may not be more than 25,264,262 shares being 5% of the ordinary share capital on issue at the date of establishment of the Executive scheme.
The exercise price to be paid by a participant when exercising options granted will be determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The price shall not be lower than the closing middle market price of shares of that class as listed on the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List on the day prior to the Grant date or the average closing middle market price of shares of that class on the three days prior to the Grant date if so decided by the Remuneration Committee.
Options may be exercised after the third anniversary of the Grant date subject to satisfactory completion of performance conditions.
Options must normally be exercised before the expiry of 10 years from the date of the grant.
Options may be exercised earlier in the event of death.
Share-based payment continued 2000 Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan On 18 April 2000 the group established a share option programme for certain directors and employees.
"All participants in the 2000 Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan ""SEEPP"" must be employed by United Business Media or one of its subsidiaries at the time of granting the options."
Shares are purchased on the open market and financed through bonuses sacrificed by senior executives the 'Bonus Option' under the terms of SEEPP.
The number of options granted to a participant under SEEPP is dependent on the level of the annual bonus awarded.
The Remuneration Committee may then exercise its discretion to grant an equal number of shares the 'Matching Option' as granted under the Bonus Option.
The number of ordinary shares which may be placed under option under SEEPP in any year may not be more than 50,528,525 shares, being 10% of the ordinary share capital on issue at the date of establishment of the plan.
There is no monetary consideration payable for the options granted under the plan to directors and employees, these are granted by Deed only.
The Remuneration Committee is also able to grant shares or options to the Trustees of the United Business Media Employee Share Ownership Trust 'ESOP Trust'.
If shares of the class issued are listed on the London Stock Exchange, the exercise price shall not be lower than the closing middle market price of shares of that class as listed on the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List on the day prior to the date that the options are granted or on the date of issue of shares.
Options may be exercised after the fourth anniversary of the Grant date subject to satisfactory completion of performance conditions.
One-third of Matching options vest subject to earnings per share 'EPS' growth exceeding retail price index 'RPI' growth plus 3%: one-third of options vest subject to EPS growth exceeding RPI growth plus 5% per annum over 4 years: the final third is not subject to performance criteria.
Share options outstanding at the end of the year have an exercise price of nil, and an average weighted remaining life of 8 years.
The SEEPP has now been closed and no further grants will be made under the scheme.
Save As You Earn Option Schemes On 6 May 2004, the group established the Sharesave Scheme SAYE' for directors and certain employees.
UBM previously operated a SAYE scheme established in 1994.
Under these schemes all participants in the SAYE scheme must be employed by United Business Media or one of its subsidiaries at the time of granting the options.
The number of options granted to a participant under the SAYE scheme is at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
The number of ordinary shares which may be placed under option under the SAYE scheme in any year may not be more than 10% of the ordinary share capital on issue at the time of granting options.
The exercise price to be paid by a participant when exercising options granted will be determined by the Directors and shall not be less than the greater of 80% of market value of the shares at the date of invitation to enter the SAYE scheme or the nominal value of unissued shares.
Options may be exercised after either the third or fifth anniversary of the Grant date in accordance with each employee's Savings Contract.
Options must normally be exercised within 6 months of the date the options are exercisable or within 12 months in the case of death.
Options may be exercised earlier in the event of death, or ceasing to be employed due to retirement, injury, disability or, at the absolute discretion of the board, redundancy.
Share options outstanding at the end of the year have the following exercise prices: 2005 2005 2004 2004 Weighted Weighted average Number average Number remaining life of shares remaining life of shares Exercise price p years m years m 160.5 2.2 1,510,859 3.1 2,764,272 412.3 497.0 2.8 462,170 2.7 523,699 514.8 632.7 0.3 4,418 1.2 10,515 p. 90 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2005 28.
Share-based payment continued Medium Term Incentive Plan Medium Term Incentive Plan 'MTIP' participants must be employed by United Business Media or one of its subsidiaries at the time of granting the options.
The number of options granted to a participant under the MTIP is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The MTIP is to be discontinued after 2006.
Only market-purchased shares may be used for awards under the MTIP.
The number of ordinary shares which may be placed under option under the MTIP scheme in any year depends on the monetary value of a bonus awarded to an employee during the year.
The number is calculated by dividing the monetary value of the bonus by the average December share price in the year preceding the year of performance measurement.
There is no monetary consideration payable for the options granted and shares subsequently acquired under the plan to directors and employees, these are granted by Deed only.
Options may be exercised in two stages: 50% of options may be exercised in January of the second financial year after the year in which they were granted: the remaining 50% may be exercised in January of the third financial year after the options were granted.
Options may only be granted subject to satisfactory completion of performance conditions.
Options must normally be exercised before the expiry of 7 years from the date of the grant.
Options may be exercised earlier in the event of death or ceasing to be employed due to retirement, injury, disability or redundancy.
The exercise price of the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2005 is nil, and the weighted average life of the share options is six years.
Awards outstanding at the end of the year expiring on 25 March 2011 and 31 March 2012 were 0.4 million and 0.3 million respectively.
Performance Share Plan On 26 September 2005 the group established an incentive plan for full-time directors and senior executives.
All participants in the Performance Share Plan PSP must be employed by United Business Media or one of its subsidiaries at the time of granting the awards.
The value of awards granted to a participant under the performance plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The PSP provides a share based award which requires United Business Medias total shareholder return TSR to outperform a comparator group of companies over a three year period.
25% of the award will vest if TSR is at median position subject to a maximum value of 25% of base salary and 100% if TSR is in the top decile.
In between these positions, the award will vest on a straight line basis.
The awards are made in the form of options exercisable on payment of a nominal value of 1.
The number of ordinary shares over which an award is made is calculated by dividing the monetary value of the award by the price of UBM ordinary shares at the time of grant.
The number of ordinary shares over which awards may be granted under the PSP may not result in more than 10% of the ordinary share capital being issued or issuable under the companys incentive plans in any ten year period.
It is expected that market purchased shares will generally be used for awards under the PSP.
Awards outstanding at the end of the year expiring on 12 October 2015 and 7 November 2015 were 0.4 million and 0.4 million respectively.
Bonus Investment Plan On 26 September 2005 the group established the Bonus Incentive Plan BIP, which replaces the SEEPP.
This enables participants to defer part of their annual bonus into United Business Media ordinary shares and provides the opportunity to earn further shares.
25% of any annual bonus award will be automatically deferred into shares to be held for three years, and the participant may also elect to defer up to a further 25% into shares for the same period.
At the end of three years the participant could receive up to two additional shares for every share held if the companys earnings per share have grown by more than an average of at least 7% per annum above UK retail price index growth over the three year period.
A lower ratio of matching shares may be earned if earnings per share have grown by more than 3% per annum above UK retail price index growth.
Awards are made in the form of options which are exercisable on payment of a nominal 1.
The number of ordinary shares which may be placed under option under the BIP depends on the monetary value of the bonus awarded to an employee during the year.
For the element which is mandatorily paid in shares, the number is calculated by dividing 25% of the monetary value of the bonus by the average December share price in the year preceding the year of performance measurement.
For any further element which the employee elects to defer into shares, the number is calculated by dividing the relevant monetary value by the share price at the time of the award.
Options, once vested, must normally be exercised before the expiry of ten years from the date of grant.
Options may be exercised earlier in the event of death, or ceasing to be employed due to retirement, injury, disability or redundancy.
The first awards under the BIP are expected to be made in March 2006. p. 91 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2005 28.

The total charge for the year relating to the employee sharebased payment plans was 6.4 million 2004: 4.0 million, all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Of the 6.4 million, 1.4 million relates to discontinued activities and non-recurring costs 2004: nil.
There are no cash alternatives for the schemes.

First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting and Accounting Standards continued Notes to the IFRS adjustments 1.
Goodwill Under IFRS 3, goodwill on acquisitions is no longer amortised, but is held at its UK GAAP carrying value at the transition date and is then subject to an annual impairment review.
No impairment was identified as at 1 January 2004 or as at 31 December 2004 following our review.
An adjustment of 126.0 million was made to the income statement to reflect the reversal of amortisation under UK GAAP during 2004.
Of the 126.0 million adjustment, 124.5 million increased the carrying value of goodwill on the balance sheet, and the 1.5 million of amortisation relating to goodwill in joint ventures increased the carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity method on the balance sheet.
Intangible assets IFRS 3 requires separable intangible assets that are acquired as part of a business acquisition to be identified separately from goodwill.
These assets are amortised over their useful lives.
United has taken advantage of the transition exemption which allows the identification of intangible assets to be applied only to those acquisitions which have taken place since the transition date.
The adjustment made represents the 53.5 million of intangible assets acquired as part of the CMPMedica acquisition, transferring this amount from goodwill to intangible assets.
Amortisation of 3.1 million has been charged on these intangible assets during 2004.
Share-based payments Under IFRS 2, the fair value of share options and other share-based payments is recognised as an expense through the profit and loss account over the expected period through to the expected date of exercise.
The Standard requires recognition of the fair value of all share-based payments granted from November 2002 onwards.
In determining the impact on the profit and loss account for 2004, the cost of 4.0 million as calculated under IFRS 2 has been partially offset by the reversal of the 2.5 million charge made in respect of the groups incentive plans under UK GAAP, leaving a net adjustment of 1.5 million.
Investments accounted for using equity method Certain investments, which have been accounted for by the group as fixed asset investments under UK GAAP since 2001, will be equity accounted under IAS 28.
IAS 28 defines an associate based on the ability to exert significant influence, in contrast to UK GAAP where the influence has actually to be exerted.
Due to the change in treatment for certain investments, a reclassification of 151.3 million was made to Other investments at transition date to reclassify amounts relating to investments that are now equity accounted under IAS 28.
This amount was reclassified to Investments accounted for using the equity method, and Trade and other receivables, for 46.4 million and 104.9 million respectively.
This adjustment groups long-term loans with the historical cost of investment in accordance with IAS 28.
The UK GAAP carrying value of these investments becomes deemed cost on transition under IFRS, and classifies short-term loans separately in receivables.
The net share of profit in these associates of 2.5 million was also recorded as an adjustment in 2004, which increases the carrying value of the investment on the balance sheet at 31 December 2004.
For equity accounted investments, IAS 28 requires the share of post tax profit or loss to be shown in a separate line on the face of the income statement, compared to UK GAAP, which recognises the share of pre tax profit or loss and the share of taxation separately.
An adjustment of 1.2 million was made on the income statement, to transfer the share of tax for investments equity accounted under UK GAAP, from the taxation line to the share of profit from associates and joint ventures line on the face of the income statement.
Work in progress valuation Under UK GAAP, it is acceptable for the valuation of work in progress to include attributable overheads.
Under IAS 11, the valuation of work in progress is restricted to direct costs incurred.
An adjustment of 1.3 million was made on transition, to transfer the attributable overheads included in the work in progress balance as at 1 January 2004 to retained earnings.
A further adjustment of 0.4 million was made at 31 December 2004, to transfer the attributable overheads at year-end to operating expenses in the income statement.
p. 103 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2005 37.
First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting and Accounting Standards continued Notes to the IFRS adjustments continued 6.
Pension liability There are differences between the methodologies for the valuation of pension scheme assets under IAS 19 compared to FRS 17: under IAS 19, equity investments are valued on a bid value basis, whereas FRS 17 uses the mid-point valuation.
The adjustment of 0.9 million was made to the transition balance sheet at 1 January 2004, to recognise the additional pension costs under the IAS 19 valuation on transition compared to the FRS 17 valuation under UK GAAP.
An adjustment of 0.1 million was also made as at 31 December 2004, to reduce the retired benefit obligation liability as at 31 December 2004 to recognise the difference in the 2004 pension charge.
Deferred Taxation Under IAS 12, a deferred tax liability is recognised on the difference between the balance sheet amount of intangible assets acquired as part of the groups 2004 acquisitions and the tax base of the intangible assets.
Goodwill is grossed up by an equivalent amount and there is therefore no adjustment to net assets on recognition.
The adjustment of 15.4 million was made in 2004, to recognise a deferred tax liability on the intangible assets acquired as part of the CMPMedica acquisition and gross up goodwill accordingly.
0.9 million of the deferred tax liability was then released to the profit or loss, for the tax effect on the amortisation of the CMPMedica intangible assets in 2004.
8. Dividend creditor not accrued under IFRS Under IAS 37, the liability for dividends is not recognised until a formal obligation arises.
As a result, the final dividend in 2004 of 28.1 million that was accrued under UK GAAP has been reversed under IFRS.
Cash and cash equivalents Under IAS 1, cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions.
This is the same as UK GAAP.
However, under IFRS the cash balance also includes amounts for cash equivalents.
Cash equivalents are short-term liquid investments, and IFRS defines that cash equivalents are normally held for the purpose of meeting short-term commitments rather than investment purposes, and normally have a maturity date less than 3 months.
UK GAAP does not recognise the concept of cash equivalents, or the requirement for a maturity date of less than 3 months.
As at 1 January 2004 and as at 31 December 2004, adjustments of 114.5 million and 42.0 million respectively, were made to reclassify the credit link notes with maturities greater than 3 months at the acquisition date from cash and cash equivalents to other investments.
Holiday pay accrual Under IAS 19, all accumulating employee compensated absences that are unused at the balance sheet date must be recognised as a liability.
There is no similar requirement under UK GAAP.
An adjustment of 1.8 million was made at the transition date to recognise the holiday pay obligation at 1 January 2004, and a further 1.3 million was recognised on the acquisition of CMPMedica, to recognise the holiday pay obligations at the acquisition date.
This adjustment increased the CMPMedica goodwill on acquisition.
An accrual of 3.1 million was held at 31 December 2004.
Translation of foreign operations Under IAS 21, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date, and the income and expenses for each income statement are translated at the average rate for the period.
The resulting exchange differences must be recognised as a separate component of equity, until disposal of the foreign operation when the accumulated exchange differences will be recognised in profit or loss when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.
This is different from UK GAAP, where all exchange differences are taken directly to retained earnings.
An adjustment of 3.1 million was made at 31 December 2004, to reclassify the translation differences for foreign operations from retained earnings to other reserves.
An adjustment was also made to recognise the translation difference on the deferred tax liability recognised for the CMPMedica acquisition of 1.0 million.
This translation difference increased the deferred tax liability and reduced the total translation differences in other reserves.

Recognition of revenue on market research contracts Under IAS 11, the stage of completion method must be adopted for the recognition of revenue and expenditure on contracts where the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably.
The adjustments of 7.5 million and 7.0 million as at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 respectively relate to the revenue and corresponding expenditure to be recognised in the profit or loss on short-term market research contracts.
Assets classified as held for sale The group adopted IFRS 5 early, from 1 January 2004.
Under IFRS 5, if the sale of a non-current asset is highly probable within one year from the balance sheet date, and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, then it must be classified as held for sale.
There is no requirement for this type of reclassification under UK GAAP.
The adjustment relates to a property with a carrying value of 5.1 million as at 31 December 2004 that is expected to be sold within the next 12 months.
Consolidation of investment equity accounted under UK GAAP Under UK GAAP, control is defined as the ability to direct the financial and operating policies of an entity with the view to gaining economic benefits from activities.
Under IAS 27, control is presumed to exist when the parent owns more than half of the voting power of an entity, unless there are exceptional circumstances to demonstrate that control does not exist.
An adjustment has been made to consolidate one of the groups subsidiaries, which was treated as an equity accounted investment under UK GAAP.
Explanation of material adjustments to the cash flow statement for 2004 Due to the reclassification of credit link notes with a maturity date of greater than 3 months at 31 December 2004, from cash and cash equivalents to other investments, the movement in these credit link notes is now shown in the cash flow statement under investing activities.
There are no other material differences between the cash flow statement presented under IFRSs and the cash flow statement presented under UK GAAP.
