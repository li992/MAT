ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2004 05 IFRS Financial Information Notes to Income Statement Reclassifications Certain income statement items, previously reported under UK GAAP, have been reclassified to comply with the format of the groups Accounts as presented under IFRS.
The reclassifications below do not have any effect on the groups previously reported net income.
i IAS 28 31 Associates jointly controlled entities The groups share of the operating profit, interest and tax of associates and jointly controlled entities has been combined and disclosed on one line as share of profits of associates and jointly controlled entities in accordance with IAS 28 and IAS 31. ii IAS 17 Leases Net income in relation to finance leases in the US of 2.9 million has been reclassified from revenue to finance income 33.3 million and finance costs 30.4 million in accordance with IAS 17.
Under UK GAAP, these are accounted for on a net cash investment basis and qualify for linked presentation under FRS 5 Reporting the Substance of Transactions.
Notes to Balance Sheet Reclassifications Certain balances, previously reported under UK GAAP, have been reclassified to comply with the format of the groups Accounts as presented under IFRS.
None of these reclassifications have any effect on the groups previously reported net assets or shareholders funds.
i IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements Trade and other receivables falling due after more than one year of 18.7 million 2004 35.3 million, previously reported as part of Current assets, have been reclassified and included within Non-current assets.
Finance lease receivables falling due after more than one year of 80.8 million 2004 82.5 million, previously reported as part of Current assets, have been reclassified and included within Non-current assets.
Finance lease receivables due within one year of 7.3 million 2004 12.3 million, previously included within Trade and other receivables, have been shown separately on the face of the balance sheet.
Provisions for liabilities and charges due within one year of 80.1 million 2004 84.7 million, previously presented within Non-current liabilities, have been reclassified and shown within Current liabilities.
Obligations under finance leases of 14.0 million 2004 15.0 million, previously presented within Loans and other borrowings, have been shown separately on the face of the balance sheet.
ii IAS 12 Income taxes Current corporate tax balances of 338.9 million 2004 237.7 million, previously included within Trade and other payables falling due within one year, have been shown separately on the face of the balance sheet.
iii IAS 19 Employee benefits Pensions and other post-retirement benefits of 133.8 million 2004 152.1 million, previously included within Provisions for liabilities and charges, Trade and other payables and Trade and other receivables, have been shown separately on the face of the balance sheet.
Although this separate presentation is not required by IAS 19, this presentation has been adopted in view of the significance of these balances as accounted for under IAS 19. iv IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates Cumulative exchange gains and losses of 484.6 million 2004 484.6 million, net of related hedging gains and losses and taxation, are required by IAS 21 to be shown as a separate reserve on the face of the balance sheet.
These were previously included within retained earnings.
Under IAS 21, all financial instruments are required to be separately measured and presented at the closing balance sheet rate whereas UK GAAP permitted the use of the exchange rate specified in the contract.
As a result, foreign currency debt is translated at the closing exchange rate and the groups related derivatives have been separately presented on the balance sheet rather than disclosing the net hedge position that exists under UK GAAP.
Derivatives currently showing a gain of 37.5 million 2004 42.7 million and 11.6 million 2004 0.4 million have been included within Non-current and Current trade and other receivables respectively.
Those derivatives currently showing a loss of 2.7 million 2004 17.6 million and 17.9 million 2004 nil have been reclassified from Loans and other borrowings and included within Noncurrent and Current trade and other payables respectively.
v IAS 38 Intangible assets Certain Non-current assets, being capitalised software of 238.6 million 2004 260.9 million and hydroelectric relicensing costs of 62.5 million 2004 45.6 million, previously included within tangible assets have been reclassified as Intangible assets as required by IAS 38. vi IFRS 1 First-time adoption of IFRS The revaluation reserve of 39.7 million 2004 41.6 million, previously recognised in respect of the revaluation of the group's Manweb distribution assets has been reclassified to retained earnings.
IFRS permits previously revalued tangible assets to be recognised at deemed cost at the date of the groups transition to IFRS.
The group has applied this exemption in preparing its balance sheet in accordance with IFRS.
The group has elected not to take advantage of the IFRS 1 exemption to reset the translation reserve to zero at the date of the transition.
182 ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2004 05 Notes to IFRS Remeasurements The IFRS remeasurements do not include any adjustments for IAS 32 and IAS 39 which are being applied by the group prospectively from 1 April 2005 in accordance with the exemptions set out in IFRS 1. i IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date Dividends in respect of the groups ordinary shares declared after the balance sheet date are not accrued in the balance sheet as required by IAS 10.
Previously, under UK GAAP, such dividends were accrued in the balance sheet.
ii IAS 12 Income taxes Under UK GAAP, deferred tax is provided based on timing differences, whilst IFRS has a wider scope and requires deferred tax to be provided on all temporary differences.
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS, additional deferred tax has been provided on the temporary difference arising on acquisitions where the assets and liabilities acquired at fair value differ to their tax base.
iii IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment The group calculates its depreciation charge in respect of property, plant and equipment based on cost less estimated residual values at current prices as required by IAS 16.
Previously, under UK GAAP, the group calculated its depreciation charge for property, plant and equipment based on cost or revalued amounts less estimated residual values at prices prevailing at the time of the initial recognition of the asset or subsequent revaluation.
iv IAS 17 IFRIC 4 Leases The group has finance leases where it acts as a lessor and funds these through non-recourse debt.
Under UK GAAP, these are accounted for on a net cash investment basis and qualify for linked presentation whereby the non-recourse debt is offset against the receivable in accordance with FRS 5.
Under IFRS, such leases are required to be accounted for as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease and, unlike FRS 5, there is no concept of linked presentation in relation to non-recourse debt.
The effect of this adjustment is to present separately a finance lease receivable of 86.5 million 2004 106.3 million and 88.5 million 2004 109.4 million of non-recourse debt.
Income from finance leases increased by 4.9 million, net of a tax credit of 3.7 million for the year ended 31 March 2005.
IFRIC 4 contains specific guidance on the identification of lease arrangements.
The arrangements have been assessed against the criteria contained in IAS 17 to determine whether the leases should be categorised as operating or financing.
As a consequence, new finance lease arrangements have been recognised on the balance sheet, resulting in the recognition of additional Property, plant and equipment of 48.9 million 2004 54.7 million and additional obligations under finance leases of 70.8 million 2004 75.7 million.
Profit before tax reduced by 1.2 million for the year ended 31 March 2005. v IAS 19 Employee benefits Pensions and other post-retirement benefits have been accounted for in accordance with IAS 19.
The groups accounting policy for pensions and other post-retirement benefits requires separate recognition of the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefit arrangements in the income statement.
IAS 19 permits a number of options for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses relating to defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits.
The groups accounting policy is to recognise any actuarial gains and losses in full immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Accordingly, the pension scheme deficits and the obligations relating to other post-retirement benefits are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
Previously, under UK GAAP, the groups policy was to recognise a charge for its defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits in arriving at operating profit.
This cost comprised the regular cost of providing pensions and other post-retirement benefits and a charge or credit relating to the amortisation of actuarial gains and losses over the average remaining service lives of the employees covered by the relevant arrangements.
The difference between the cumulative charge for pensions and other post-retirement benefits and the cumulative contributions paid in respect of those arrangements was previously recognised as an asset or liability in the balance sheet.
vi IAS 36 Impairment The goodwill associated with PacifiCorp has been reviewed for impairment under both UK GAAP and IFRS, as required where there is an indicator of impairment.
This resulted in a charge for impairment under IFRS which is 5.0 million lower compared to the charge under UK GAAP, as a result of the lower net assets of PacifiCorp under IFRS.
vii IFRS 2 Share-based payment The groups employee share and share option schemes have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
This requires that a charge be recognised, using a fair value model, for all of the groups share and share option schemes.
Previously under UK GAAP, the group accounted for the cost for certain of its share and share option schemes based on an intrinsic value model.
viii IFRS 3 Business combinations Under UK GAAP, goodwill is required to be amortised over its estimated useful economic life.
On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill recognised under UK GAAP at that date is frozen and no future amortisation is charged.
Under IFRS 3, the fair values attributed to deferred tax and intangible assets on acquisitions differ from those under UK GAAP.
183 ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2004 05 IFRS Financial Information Group Cash Flow Statement under IFRS for the year ended 31 March 2005 The consolidated statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with FRS 1 Cash flow statements presents substantially the same information as that required under IFRS.
Under IFRS, however, there are certain differences from UK GAAP with regard to the classification of items within the cash flow statement and with regard to the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Under UK GAAP, cash flows are presented separately for operating activities, dividends received from joint ventures and associates, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investment, acquisitions and disposals, equity dividends paid, management of liquid resources and financing.
Under IFRS, only three categories of cash flow activity are reported: operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
Under IFRS, items which under UK GAAP would be included within management of liquid resources fall within the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
The requirements of IAS 38 state that certain non-current assets, namely capitalised software and hydroelectric relicensing costs, previously included within tangible assets, are reclassified as intangible assets.
This has resulted in 54.6 million being reclassified from the purchase of property, plant and equipment to the purchase of intangible assets.
A further 1.2 million has been reclassified from the purchase of property, plant and equipment to the proceeds from the sale of intangible assets.
IFRIC 4 contains guidance on the identification of lease arrangements.
The groups arrangements have been assessed against the criteria contained in IAS 17 to determine, firstly, whether any arrangements qualify for lease accounting and, secondly, whether the leases should be categorised as operating or finance leases.
The identification of additional finance leases has resulted in 11.7 million being reclassified from cash generated from operations to interest paid 8.8 million and proceeds from borrowings 2.9 million.
The consolidated cash flow statement prepared in conformity with UK GAAP is set out on page 114 together with Notes on pages 120 to 123.
The consolidated statement of cash flows under IFRS is set out below: 2005 m Operating activities Cash generated from operations 1,271.5 Dividends received from jointly controlled entities 2.0 Interest paid 273.4 Interest received 152.5 Income taxes paid 99.3 Net cash from operating activities 1,053.3 Investing activities Purchase of property, plant and equipment 885.2 Deferred income received 51.3 Deferred income paid 37.3 Purchase of intangible assets 53.4 Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment 21.8 Purchase of fixed asset investments 14.8 Purchase of subsidiaries 343.6 Sale of business and subsidiaries 7.5 Net cash used in investing activities 1,239.1 Financing activities Issue of share capital 21.9 Redemption of preferred stock of PacifiCorp 4.1 Dividends paid to companys equity holders 386.1 Dividends paid to minority interests 4.3 Maturity of net investment hedging derivatives 140.0 Cancellation of cross-currency swaps 92.0 Repricing of cross-currency swaps Net purchase of own shares held under trust 23.1 Proceeds from borrowings 750.4 Net cash from financing activities 586.7 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 400.9 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of financial year 1,327.2 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 400.9 Effect of foreign exchange rate changes 0.8 Cash and cash equivalents at end of financial year 1,727.3 184 ScottishPower Annual Report & Accounts 2004 05 Independent Auditors Report Special Purpose Audit Report of  LLP to Emphasis of matter Scottish Power plc on its International Financial Reporting Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to the fact that Standards IFRS Financial Information the IFRS financial information may require adjustment before its We have audited the accompanying consolidated Reconciliation of the inclusion as comparative information in the Groups first set of Group Balance Sheet under UK GAAP to IFRS of Scottish Power plc consolidated IFRS financial statements for the year ending 31 March the Company and its subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as the 2006.
