The principal goodwill relating to UK Banking and International Retail and Commercial Banking are Woolwich and Absa respectively.
Woolwich and Absa future cash flows are based on approved budgets and plans.
Woolwich has applied a growth factor of 3% proxy for inflation to cash flows for the period 2009 to 2019.
Absa has applied a growth rate of 8% to cash flows for the five years from 2009 to 2013 and a rate of 4% for the years from 2014 to 2019.
Both businesses justify the use of longer cash flow projections due to the long-term perspective of these businesses within the Barclays Group.
