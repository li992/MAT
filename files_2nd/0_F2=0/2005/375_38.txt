The total amount of tax losses and other temporary differences for which no deferred tax was recognised at 31 December 2004 was 170 million.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of earnings in overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 223.3 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.
