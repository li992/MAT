Shareholder Information Shareholder Enquiries Our registrars, Computershare Investor Services PLC, operate a dedicated telephone enquiry line for shareholders who have routine enquiries.
Electronic Communications The registrars also provide an online service that enables shareholders to access details of their Enterprise Inns shareholdings and to register to receive communications such as reports and accounts electronically.
Details can be found at www-uk.
Dividend Payments Dividends can be paid direct to UK bank or building society accounts using the BACS system so that your dividend can be paid into your account on the same day the Company makes payment.
A tax voucher will still be provided and sent to shareholders by post.
Shareholders who wish to arrange direct payment using this method should telephone the registrars on 0870 703 6297.
