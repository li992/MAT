50 TRANSITION TO IFRS All references to UK GAAP in this note are to UK GAAP applicable for the year ended 31 December 2004.
This is the first year that the Group has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 December 2004 and the date of transition to IFRS was 1 January 2004.
On 18 July 2005, the Group published detailed income statement and balance sheet reconciliations of UK GAAP to IFRS.
The following is an abridged extract of the published document describing the effects of adoption of IFRS and the reconciliations required in the year of transition.
Summary of the effects of IFRS adoption The principal impacts of IFRS on the Groups 2004 financial statements were as follows: recognition of a charge for the fair value of share-based compensation: requirement not to amortise goodwill: recognition of deferred taxation liabilities on pharmacy licences, unremitted earnings of associates and rolled over capital gains: and recognition of dividends only when they are declared rather than when proposed.
In terms of the 2004 results, reported profits increased under IFRS, mainly because of the reversal of goodwill amortisation and the reversal of goodwill recycled from reserves on the disposal of subsidiaries.
Impact on profit Excluding goodwill amortisation, the profit on disposal of subsidiaries and amounts written off investments, the effect of adoption of IFRS was not significant.
The Group considers the measurement of profit excluding these items to be a useful indication of underlying performance.
The reduction in profits as a result of the requirement to recognise a charge for the fair value of share-based compensation awards was largely offset by the net credit arising from the movements in deferred taxation liabilities recognised on unremitted earnings of associates, pharmacy licences and rolled over capital gains.
Impact on net assets Net assets at 31 December 2004 decreased under IFRS.
This was predominantly due to the recognition of additional deferred taxation liabilities under IFRS as a general principle, the recognition of deferred taxation liabilities is more comprehensive under IFRS than UK GAAP.
Partially offsetting this reduction in net assets was the reversal of the 2004 goodwill amortisation charge and the accrual for the proposed 2004 final dividend.
