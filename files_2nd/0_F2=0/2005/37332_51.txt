Financial assets and liabilities This Note should be read in conjunction with the comments set out in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 19-23.
The Group has defined financial assets and liabilities as those assets and liabilities of a financial nature, namely cash, investments, borrowings and interest rate swaps.
All the Groups financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling and, with the exception of the committed bank facilities and unsecured money market loans, are at fixed rates.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities and their fair values are: Excess of fair value over Book value Fair value book value 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 m m m m m m Financial assets Short-term investments and cash 11.1 241.8 11.1 241.8 Financial liabilities Debentures, bonds, other loans and overdrafts 2,934.2 2,677.6 3,000.7 3,249.1 66.5 571.5 Non-equity B shares 8.4 8.4 Financial instruments Interest rate swaps 3.3 44.5 3.3 44.5 2,923.1 2,444.2 2,992.9 3,060.2 69.8 616.0 At 31 March 2004 short-term investments and cash include 154.0m of short-term deposits charged as temporary security for borrowings.
As a consequence of the Groups debt restructuring, the use of short-term deposits as temporary security is not currently required.
Financial liabilities 2005 2004 Weighted average period of fixed interest rates 17.5 years 12.4 years Weighted average fixed interest rate 5.3% 7.3% Fair value has been calculated by taking the market value, for those instruments which have a listing, or where one is not available, the fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach.
The difference between book value and fair value will not result in any change to the cash flows of the Group unless, at some stage in the future, fixed rate borrowings are purchased in the market, or repaid, at a price different from the nominal value.
As at 31 March 2004 the Group excluding Land Securities Trillium had a number of interest rate swaps with a net notional value of 600m.
These swaps had the effect of fixing interest rates and were terminated during the financial year for a cost of 42.0m.
Forward starting interest rate swaps commencing January 2006 with a notional value of 250m and a term of five years were entered into in March 2005.
On these swaps the Group pays fixed interest and receives floating interest.
As the intention of the new interest rate swaps is to fix the interest rates on existing and new borrowings, their mark to market value has not been recognised in the financial statements and instead net interest is accrued through the profit and loss account.
Land Securities Trillium currently has two interest rate swaps in place to hedge the interest rate risk on the PRIME term loan.
Both swaps are amortising and their nominal amounts decrease in line with the repayment profile of the debt.
Their notional values are currently 183.1m and 62.8m.
