Notes to the Accounts Continued 1 Accounting policies continued j Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at actual exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions, or where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in related forward exchange contracts.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at that date, or where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in related forward contracts.

VAT on tangible fixed assets is capitalised and written off over a similar period to the asset to which it relates.
l Financial instruments Derivative instruments utilised by the group are primarily interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts.

Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
