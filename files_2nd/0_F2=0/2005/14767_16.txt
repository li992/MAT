Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
All accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the period and the preceding period.
The particular accounting policies adopted are described below.
a Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of certain assets.
b Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all subsidiary undertakings for the fty two weeks to 29 July 2005.
The previous accounting period was for the fty two weeks to 30 July 2004. c Turnover Turnover represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, normally on shipment of the product.
d Goodwill In respect of business combinations entered into by the Group, the fair value of the purchase consideration given is allocated between the underlying net assets of the acquired businesses other than goodwill, on the basis of the fair value to the Group.
In the case of business combinations entered into after 31 July 1998, purchased goodwill is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful economic life subject to impairment reviews where indicators of impairment exist.
Each acquisition is separately evaluated for the purposes of determining its useful economic life, which shall not exceed twenty years.
The useful economic lives are reviewed annually and revised if necessary.
Any goodwill arising from business combinations entered into prior to 31 July 1998 was written off directly to reserves.
Such goodwill is reinstated on disposal of those businesses and charged to the profit and loss account in the relevant period.
e Tangible xed assets Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or assets in the course of construction.
On other assets it is provided on cost or revalued amounts in equal annual instalments over the estimated lives of the assets with a minimum rate of 2 per cent.
The annual rates of depreciation are as follows: Freehold buildings 2% 4% Leasehold properties Period of lease Leasehold improvements 10% 20% 1 Plant and machinery 10% 33 3% 1 Fixtures, ttings and equipment 20% 33 3% Motor vehicles 20% 25% As permitted by Financial Reporting Standard 15 Tangible Fixed Assets, those freehold buildings valued at 31 July 1985 continue to be carried at that value, subject to depreciation.

Accounting policies continued f Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are revalued to directors valuation and are stated at net asset value.
In the opinion of the directors this valuation policy gives a fair representation of the net worth of the Company.
g Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost represents materials, direct labour and appropriate production overheads.
h Deferred taxation In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred Taxation, deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more taxation, or a right to pay less taxation at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current taxation rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Deferred taxation is not provided on timing differences arising from the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where there is no commitment to remit these earnings nor in respect of gains realised that have been rolled over into the acquisition costs of replacement assets.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.
i Regional grants Regional grants are provided for and amortised in equal annual instalments over the estimated lives of the assets to which they relate.
j Provisions for repairs Where the Group is committed under the terms of a lease to make repairs to leasehold premises, provision is made for the estimated cost of repairs over the lease period.
k Foreign currencies The results of the overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into Sterling at the average rates of exchange during the period.
The balance sheets of the overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into Sterling at the rates at the balance sheet date.
The resulting exchange differences are taken to reserves.
Where foreign currency borrowings have been used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries, exchange gains or losses on the borrowings have been offset in reserves to the extent that they do not exceed the associated exchange differences arising on the retranslation of net investments.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the local currency at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates ruling at that date.
These exchange differences are included in profit on ordinary activities before taxation.
l Derivative financial instruments The Group does not hold derivative financial instruments derivatives to manage the currency exposure of borrowings or to provide a complete hedge against investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings.
Purchases of capital equipment and materials denominated in foreign currencies, and the sale of goods similarly denominated, are hedged by specic forward exchange contracts or by balancing 38 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2005 transactions.
The Group does not trade in or undertake any speculative derivative transactions.
Gains or losses in respect of hedges of future transactions are deferred and recognised as appropriate when the hedged transaction occurs.

Pension costs The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP24 and the disclosures given in a below are those required by that standard.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benets FRS17 was issued in November 2000 and the transitional disclosures required by that standard, to the extent not covered in a, are set out in b below.
a The Group operates a dened benets pension scheme in which approximately half of its UK employees participate, with assets held in separate trustee adminstered funds the dened benets scheme.
This scheme was closed to new entrants from 6 April 2002, but benets continue to accrue for existing active members.
A dened contribution scheme has been established for joiners after 6 April 2002, to which the Group contributes at the rate of 4 per cent of pensionable pay.
The pension cost for the Groups UK schemes was 4,380,000 2004 3,400,000.
A triennial valuation of the dened benets scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2005, using the projected unit method, by Jonathan Punter, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, Punter Southall & Co Ltd the actuary, who is independent of the Group.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted for the purposes of both SSAP24 and determining the funding rate in the valuation were: a long term interest rate investment return of 7.8 per cent per annum before Normal Retirement Age NRA and 5.3 per cent per annum after NRA: salary increases of 3.9 per cent per annum and limited price indexation of 2.9 per cent per annum.
Pension increases were allowed for in accordance with the rules of the dened benets scheme and past practice.
At the valuation date, the actuarial value of the assets on this basis was sufficient to cover 86 per cent of the benets that had been accrued to members equivalent to a deficit of 23.2 million.
The market value of the dened benets schemes assets, as at 6 April 2005, was 41 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2005 N OTES TO THE F INANCIAL S TATEMENTS continued 4.
Information regarding employees, directors and pension costs continued 143.3 million.
For the purpose of the actuarial valuation, assets were taken at market value.
These results remain preliminary until the actuarys formal valuation report has been signed.
The increase in the deficit can mainly be attributed to the revised mortality assumption adopted.
The 2005 valuation has been based on post-retirement mortality table PA92 Year of birth whereas the 2002 valuation was based on table PA90 Age-rated down two years.
The PA92 table reects significant improvements in pensioner life expectancy.
The Company has continued to pay contributions at the rate of 10.6 per cent of pensionable pay in accordance with the actuarys recommendation.
Following the results of the 2005 valuation, the contribution rate is currently under review.
Included in debtors is a prepayment of 25,001,000 2004 25,068,000, inclusive of interest accrued, mainly arising as a result of a one-off payment by the Company into the dened benets scheme in May 2004.
The pension cost relating to foreign schemes was 529,000 2004 1,680,000.
The foreign schemes are dened contribution schemes and are principally Section 401 k Plans in the USA.
b The FRS17 disclosures below have been based on the actuarial valuation of the dened benets scheme as at 6 April 2005 adjusted to allow for the assumptions and actuarial methodology required by FRS17 and updated to 29 July 2005 by the actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 29 July 2005 30 July 2004 1 August 2003 per annum per annum per annum Rate of increase in salaries 3.8% 3.9% 3.6% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.8% 2.9% 2.6% Discount rate 5.0% 5.7% 5.5% Ination assumption 2.8% 2.9% 2.6% The FRS17 assumptions are similar to those used for funding and the SSAP24 disclosures, except for the lower investment return assumption discount rate used of 5.0 per cent which is based on corporate bond yields.
This has the effect of increasing the value placed on the liabilities and thereby increases the deficit disclosed.
The higher investment return used for funding and SSAP24 purposes reects the higher return expected in the long term by investing in asset classes other than corporate bonds, in particular equities.
The assets, the expected rates of return on the assets and the liabilities of the scheme were: Long term Long term Long term rate of return rate of return rate of return expected at Value at expected at Value at expected at Value at 29 July 2005 29 July 2005 30 July 2004 30 July 2004 1 August 2003 1 August 2003 per annum 000 per annum 000 per annum 000 Equities or equivalent 7.0% 77,707 7.0% 62,505 7.0% 58,224 Bonds 4.7% 63,441 5.3% 39,276 5.2% 34,384 Other 4.5% 12,233 4.5% 27,089 4.8% 2,377 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Total market value of assets 153,381 128,870 94,985 Present value of liabilities 219,965 173,801 156,753 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf deficit in the scheme 66,584 44,931 61,768 Related deferred tax asset 19,975 13,479 18,530 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Net pension liability 46,609 31,452 43,238 aaaasdf aaaasdf aaaasdf 42 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2005 The effect on the Groups profit and loss account and the statement of total recognised gains and losses in respect of the dened benets scheme, had FRS17 been adopted during the year, would have been as follows: 2005 2004 000 000 Analysis of the amount charged to operating profit: Current service cost 4,002 5,032 Past service costs Settlements curtailments 600 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Total operating charge 3,402 5,032 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Analysis of the amount charged to other finance costs: Expected return on pension scheme assets 7,719 6,290 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 9,976 8,764 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Net finance charge 2,257 2,474 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Net charge to profit and loss account 5,659 7,506 aaaasdf aaaasdf 2005 2004 000 000 Analysis of amount recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses: Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 15,270 1,207 Experience gains and losses arising on the scheme liabilities 8,367 1,505 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 44,755 3,632 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Actuarial loss recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses 21,118 6,344 aaaasdf aaaasdf 2005 2004 000 000 Movement in deficit during the year: deficit in the scheme at the beginning of year 44,931 61,768 Movement in year: Current service cost 4,002 5,032 Contributions 5,124 30,687 Past service costs Settlements curtailments 600 Other net finance charges 2,257 2,474 Actuarial loss 21,118 6,344 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf deficit in the scheme at end of year 66,584 44,931 aaaasdf aaaasdf 43 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2005 N OTES TO THE F INANCIAL S TATEMENTS continued 4.
Information regarding employees, directors and pension costs continued The actuarial valuation, adjusted for FRS17 and updated at 29 July 2005, showed a deficit of 66.6 million.
Contributions for the year were paid at the rate of 10.6 per cent of pensionable pay.
The contribution rate is currently under review as part of the formal valuation of the dened benets scheme, being carried out as at 6 April 2005.
This scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 6 April 2002.
As a result, the current service cost calculated using the projected unit method will increase over time expressed as a percentage of pensionable pay but will be applied to a shrinking pensionable payroll.

Contingent liabilities Neither the Group nor Company had contingent liabilities at 29 July 2005 or at 30 July 2004.
Derivatives and other financial instruments a Interest rate risk The Group nances its operations through a mixture of retained earnings and bank borrowings.
Group policy is to manage exposure risk to interest rate uctuations with bank borrowings, predominantly short term, at oating rates with matching short term deposits of surplus funds.
b Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to maintain exibility with respect to its liquidity position, by utilising short term cash deposits and where necessary short term bank borrowings for all working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
It is the Groups policy to utilise, if appropriate, bank borrowings in foreign currencies to finance overseas acquisitions, which also provide a hedge against net investments in overseas subsidiaries.
c Foreign currency risk The Group has overseas subsidiaries which operate in the USA and Holland and whose revenues and expenses are denominated exclusively in the relevant foreign currencies.
In order to provide some protection to the Groups Sterling balance sheet from the movements in these foreign exchange rates, the Group may, if appropriate, finance a part of its net investment in these subsidiaries by means of overseas borrowings subject to the interest cost of those borrowings.
The extent of this nancing at 29 July 2005 was 31 per cent of the designated part of its gross investment in foreign currencies.
The Groups UK subsidiaries sales are principally with customers in the UK, and are denominated in Sterling.

g Currency analysis of monetary assets and liabilities After taking into account the effect of any hedging transactions undertaken to manage currency exposures there were no significant net foreign currency monetary assets or liabilities giving rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account at either 29 July 2005 or 30 July 2004.
Matched assets and liabilities are those that generate no gain or loss in the profit and loss account, either because they are denominated in the same currency as the Group operations to which they belong or because they qualify under Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 20 Foreign Currency Translation as a foreign currency borrowing providing a hedge against a foreign equity investment.

k Gains and losses on hedges The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge purchases of capital and materials denominated in foreign currencies and the sale of goods similarly denominated.
