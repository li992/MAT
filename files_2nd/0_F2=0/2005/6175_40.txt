Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the ESOP Trust which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has three categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares, being those share options granted to employees under a SAYE share option scheme, the Directors share options exercised in May 2005 where the exercise price was less than the average market price of the Companys shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the LTIP.
One-off costs charged against operating profit and increases in fair value of investment properties do not relate to the profitability of the Group on an on-going basis.
Underlying earnings per share excludes such items and the tax thereon from the profit for the year attributable to shareholders, with the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year as per the calculation for basic earnings per share.
