Share-based payment arrangements During the year the following share-based payment arrangements were in operation by the Company: The Share Option Scheme The extent, nature, term and general terms and conditions, including vesting, relating to this arrangement, are detailed in the Report on Directors Remuneration on pages 29, 30, 33 and 34.
The Share Save Scheme The extent, nature, term and general terms and conditions, including vesting, relating to this arrangement, are also detailed in the Report on Directors Remuneration on pages 29 and 30.
The Share Option and Share Save Scheme are considered to be equity-settled transactions, and for all awards post 7 November 2002, require to be fair valued at the date of award.
The fair value process and the underlying assumptions used are described below.
Based on the results of this actuarial review, the Share Save Scheme was demonstrated to be immaterial and accordingly the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments, are not applied to this arrangement.
The Phantom Option Scheme Senior managers excluding Directors, participate in this arrangement, which mirrors the terms and conditionality of the Share Option Scheme, except that on exercise they are cash-settled transactions.
As such, these transactions also require to be fair valued, but at each reporting date.
The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services during the year to 31 December 2005 is 2,302,000 2004: 435,000.
The portion of that expense arising from equity-settled share-based payment transactions is 408,000 2004: 165,000.

These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
2 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was 6.441 2004: 3.517 58 | Dana Petroleum plc 2005 Annual Report For the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2005, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 6.52 years 2004: 7.02 years.
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was 1.575 - 4.135 2004: 1.275 - 4.135.
For the two awards of share options post 7 November 2002 January 2003 and December 2004, the Company was assisted in the process of establishing the fair value at the date of the grant of the awards by CPRM, a professional actuarial firm, and part of the Cavanagh group.
CPRM estimated the fair value using a binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted, and also the performance conditions that were required to be satisfied before vesting.
CPRM were provided with the detailed rules of each scheme and all the objective data relating to historic awards grants, exercises, lapses, withdrawals etc as well the Companys historic daily share price and staff turnover analysis.
In addition, the following assumptions were also made with respect to the expected volatility of the Companys share price and the expected life of an option.
For volatility, the Company used share price data from 2002 onwards.
This was the year the Company acquired 4 new producing development assets in the North Sea, which were transforming to the Company, and which significantly reduced the influence of the historic Russian activity on the Company.
This geographical shift has lead to a lower volatility in the Companys share price which is expected to continue into the future.
CPRM were able to corroborate this fact by establishing that the standard deviation of the Companys share price the measure of volatility from the FTSE All Share Index throughout the historic period, reduced considerably from 2002 onwards.
Accordingly, an annual volatility assumption of 34% was utilised.
The life of the option depends on the trigger levels at which employees decide to exercise before they expire and the extent to which option holders withdraw from the schemes due to staff turnover.
Due to the small number of members included in the Dana schemes, the results of any historic analysis are very sensitive to personal circumstances at the time of exercise and therefore the results are not representative nor an appropriate profile to extrapolate into the future.
Accordingly, on CPRMs recommendation, a profile was used which was consistent with their wider actuarial experience of actual member exercise rates but still aligned with the specific history for the Dana Scheme.
The staff turnover assumption is based on the Companys historic rate of staff turnover amongst all share option holders.
This was established from factual historic data at 8% pa.
The fair value of the Phantom cash-settled options was established in exactly the same way, and until the liability is ultimately settled, it is required to be remeasured at each reporting date, with changes to fair value recognised in the income statement.
The carrying amount of the liability relating to the cash-settled options at 31 December 2005 is 2,164,000 2004: 270,000.
