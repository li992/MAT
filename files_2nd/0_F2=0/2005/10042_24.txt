Summary of significant accounting policies sheet date.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group in the preparation of consolidated financial statements are set out below.
Revenue recognition These policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented unless stated otherwise.

Acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value at the date of exchange of the consideration provided plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
To the extent that the cost of an acquisition exceeds the Meggitt PLC report and accounts 2005 47 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2.

When such shares are sold Derivative financial instruments with maturities of less than 12 months any consideration received, net of any directly attributable costs, is from the balance sheet are shown as current assets or liabilities.
The method by which any gain or loss arising from remeasurement is recognised depends on whether the instrument is designated as 3.
Financial risk management a hedging instrument and if so the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group recognises an instrument as a hedging instrument by Financial risk factors documenting at the inception of the instrument the relationship between the instrument and the hedged item and the objectives and The Groups operations expose it to a number of financial risks strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction.
To be designated including foreign currency risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and as a hedging instrument, an instrument must also be assessed, at liquidity risk.
These risks are managed by a centralised treasury inception and on an ongoing basis, to be highly effective in offsetting department, according to Board approved objectives, policies and changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Regular reports monitor exposures and assist in managing the associated risks.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements In applying the Groups accounting policies set out in note 2 management is required to make certain estimates and judgements concerning the future.
These estimates and judgements are regularly reviewed and updated as necessary.
The estimates and judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts included in these consolidated financial statements are as follows: Income taxes In determining the Group provisions for income tax and deferred tax it is necessary to consider transactions in a small number of key tax jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to income tax and deferred tax provisions held in the period the determination is made.
Pensions The liability recognised in respect of retirement benefit obligations is dependent on a number of estimates including those relating to mortality, inflation, salary increases and the rate at which liabilities are discounted.
Any change in these assumptions would impact the retirement benefit obligation recognised.
Further details on these estimates are set out in note 34.
Goodwill Each year the Group carries out impairment tests of its goodwill balances which requires estimates to be made of the value in use of its cash generating units CGUs.
These value in use calculations are dependent on estimates of the future cash flows and long term growth rates of the CGUs.
Further details are provided in note 19.
Development costs and deferred costs The Group capitalises development costs and deferred costs provided they meet certain criteria as set out in note 2.
Costs are only capitalised where management are satisfied as to the ultimate commercial viability of the project based on available information.
Projects typically involve long term relationships on aircraft platforms and in assessing commercial viability estimates need to be made of future revenues which are dependent on a number of factors including the size, utilisation and life of the aircraft fleet to which the capitalised costs relate.
Environmental matters The Group is exposed to a number of environmental claims relating to businesses sold by Whittaker prior to its acquisition by the Group in 1999.
Advice is received by the Group from its environmental consultants and legal advisers to assist in the determination of the timing and an estimate of the costs that the Group may incur in respect of such claims and an appropriate provision is made.
To the extent that these estimates change as more information becomes available adjustments are made to the carrying value of the provision.
The Group has extensive insurance arrangements in place to mitigate the impact of historical environmental events on the Group.
Contingent liabilities The Group is subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
The Group is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgements or outcomes, as well as potential ranges of probable losses.
A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is based on a careful analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel.
However, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates.
Fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination On the acquisition of a business it is necessary to attribute fair values to any intangible assets acquired provided they meet the criteria to be recognised.
The fair values of these intangible assets are dependent on estimates of attributable future revenues, margins and cash flows.

Reconciliations between profit and underlying profit The Group has historically reported additional profit measures where it was felt that these gave a better view of the underlying trading performance.
Under IFRS the Group continues to report these additional measures, now called underlying operating profit, underlying profit before tax and underlying profit for the year and the derivation of these measures is shown below: Notes 2005 2004 000 000 Operating profit 102,441 82,051 Exceptional operating costs see note 11 6,995 7,879 Amortisation of intangibles acquired in business combinations a 10,883 3,272 Revaluations of inventory acquired in business combinations b 226 8,492 Financial instruments c 10,054 Adjustments to operating profit 28,158 19,643 Underlying operating profit 130,599 101,694 Profit before taxation 88,127 70,656 Adjustments to operating profit per above 28,158 19,643 Underlying profit before taxation 116,285 90,299 Profit for the year 66,235 52,540 Adjustments to operating profit per above 28,158 19,643 Tax effect of adjustments to operating profit 8,342 6,265 Underlying profit for the year 86,051 65,918 a The Group excludes from its underlying profit figures the amortisation of intangibles acquired in business combinations.
2005 2004 000 000 Amortisation of other intangible assets see note 21 12,318 3,714 Less amortisation of purchased intangible assets see note 21 1,435 442 Amortisation of intangibles acquired in business combinations 10,883 3,272 b. IFRS 3 requires finished goods acquired through a business combination to be valued at selling prices less costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort.
Work in progress WIP acquired in a business combination is valued at selling prices less costs to complete, costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the work not yet completed.
The fair value of inventory acquired is thus generally higher than that built post completion which includes no profit element.
This increase arising from the revaluation of acquired inventory is charged to the income statement as the inventory is consumed and is excluded from the Groups underlying profit figures.
c. Although the Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against foreign currency exposures it has decided that the costs of meeting the extensive documentation required to be able to apply hedge accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are not merited.
The Groups underlying profit figures exclude amounts which would not have been recorded if hedge accounting had been applied.
As IAS 39 was adopted with effect from 1 January 2005 there are no comparative figures.

Profit of parent company The consolidated profit attributable to the shareholders of Meggitt PLC includes a profit, after dividends received of 70,384,000 2004 52,604,000 as restated which has been dealt with in the accounts of that Company.
Meggitt PLC has taken advantage of the legal dispensation contained in Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 allowing it not to publish a separate profit and loss account.
Earnings per ordinary share Earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The weighted average number of shares excludes shares bought by the Group and held as treasury shares.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share adjusts the weighted average number of shares to reflect the assumption that all potentially dilutive ordinary shares convert.
For the Group this means assuming all share options in issue are exercised.

The key assumptions used in the calculations were: The forecast operating cash flows for the next three years based on approved budgets and plans.
These budgets and plans are based on past performance and expectations for the market development of the CGU.
An estimate of the long-term effective tax rate for the CGU.
An estimate of the long-term growth rate for the CGU.
The growth rate does not exceed the long-term estimate for the business in which the CGU operates.
An estimate of the terminal value of the business using the Gordon Growth model.
The resulting cash flows were discounted using a post tax discount rate of 8%.

Financial instruments For cash, investments available for sale, receivables and short term borrowings the fair value of the financial instruments approximates to their book value due to the short maturity periods of these financial instruments.
On receivables allowances are made within the book value for credit risk.
For medium and long-term borrowings and other financial liabilities the fair value is based on market values or, where not available, on discounting future cash flows at prevailing market rates.
Market rates have been used to determine the fair values of the interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.

Provision has been made for the gross estimated liability and an asset of 44,383,000 2004: 22,989,000 has been recognised as a receivable for the amounts recoverable from the insurers see note 25.
At acquisition, Whittaker was also subject to certain litigation claims, both existing and threatened, relating to businesses it had sold but for which it retained a liability.
A provision exists representing the best estimate of the outcome of the claims including costs.
The provisions are expected to be mainly utilised over the next ten years.
b Provision has been set up for the estimated rental shortfall in respect of properties with onerous lease obligations and will be utilised over the lease terms typically up to ten years.

The majority relate to the Groups operations in the USA and pre-acquisition losses in the acquired Dunlop businesses.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items, as it is not regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets not recognised would be recoverable in the event that they reverse and suitable taxable profits are available.
No provision has been made for taxation that would arise in the event of foreign subsidiaries distributing their reserves as these amounts are retained for investment in the business.
Owing to the availability of tax losses and foreign tax credits, it is currently estimated that no additional tax would arise if any such amounts were to be distributed.

Retirement benefit obligations In the UK, most employees are members of the Meggitt Group 1990 Pension Plan 1990 Plan, the Meggitt Executive Pension Plan MEPP or the Dunlop Aerospace Limited UK Pension Scheme Dunlop.
These are defined benefit plans, the assets of which are held in trust funds separate from the Groups finances.
In the USA most employees are covered by defined contribution 401k plans.
In 1994, prior to acquisition by the Group, Whittaker Corporation amended its 401k plans and also froze benefits to the Whittaker Corporation Employees Pension Plan Whittaker Frozen Plan, a defined benefit scheme.

In determining pension liabilities the Group uses mortality assumptions which are based on published mortality tables adjusted to reflect the characteristics of the schemes populations.
During the year the Group has reflected more up to date mortality assumptions in its determination of pension liabilities.
In 2005 mortality assumptions were based on the PA92 medium cohort Year of birth mortality tables for the UK schemes 2004: PXA92c2020 for Dunlop and PMA92 for MEPP and 1990 Plan and the RP-2000 tables for the US schemes 2004: GAM 83 RPA 94 version.

Contingent liabilities The parent Company has given guarantees in respect of uncommitted credit facilities for certain of its subsidiaries, some property leases, other leasing arrangements and the performance by some current and former subsidiaries of certain contracts.
Also, there are similar guarantees given by certain of the management companies.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
The directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, actions and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.

Share based payment 1996 No 1 & No 2 Executive Share Option Schemes and Executive Share Option Scheme 2005 Share options are granted to certain senior executives at an exercise price equal to the market price of the shares on the date the grant is made.
The options are exercisable at the earliest three years after the grant is made.
Options can only be exercised if the Group meets an earnings per share performance condition.
The Group has no obligation, legal or constructive, to settle the options in cash.
Movements in the number of outstanding share options and their related weighted average exercise price are as follows: 2005 2005 2004 2004 Average Number of Average Number of exercise options exercise options price outstanding price outstanding pence 000s pence 000s Balance at 1 January 188.03 8,325 168.24 8,142 Granted 325.50 1,932 241.29 2,025 Lapsed 170.50 368 Exercised 135.37 1,841 156.25 1,474 Balance at 31 December 226.68 8,416 188.03 8,325 Amounts and prices above have been adjusted to reflect the bonus element of the rights issue approved by shareholders on 21 July 2004.
The fair value of the options was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The fair value of options granted during the year was 1,568,000 2004: 1,481,000.
The significant assumptions used in the model were: 2005 2004 2004 Award in Award in Award in October October April Share price at date of grant pence 325.50 246.00 203.72 Exercise price pence 325.50 246.00 203.72 Vesting period years 3 33 Expected volatility 35% 40% 40% Expected option life years 5 55 Risk free rate 4.10% 4.85% 4.85% Expected dividend yield 3.10% 3.25% 3.25% Expected volatility figures are based on historical volatility over the last three years measured using a statistical analysis of daily share prices.
Share appreciation rights Under the terms of the Meggitt Executive Share Option Scheme 2005 the Group may issue share appreciation rights SARs to certain overseas employees.
The Group is required to pay the intrinsic value of the SAR to the employee at the date of exercise.
The fair value of each SAR is determined using the Black-Scholes model reflecting the assumptions above.
An expense of 114,000 2004: Nil was recorded in the year.
The Group has recorded a liability at the balance sheet date of 114,000 2004: Nil.
The total intrinsic value was 1,367,000 2004: Nil.
Meggitt Equity Participation Scheme and Meggitt Equity Participation Plan 2005 Under the Meggitt Equity Participation Scheme the number of shares, if any, that an executive would ultimately have received was dependent on Meggitts performance during a one-year period commencing at the beginning of the financial year preceding that in which the award was made the measurement period.
Performance was measured by comparing the Total Shareholder Return TSR achieved by Meggitt with that of other companies in a comparator group chosen by the Remuneration Committee.
The Meggitt Equity Participation Scheme was replaced by the Meggitt Equity Participation Plan 2005 during the year.
Under the Meggitt Equity Participation Plan 2005 an annual award of shares may be made to certain senior executives under the Plan.
The number of shares if any, that an executive will ultimately receive, will depend on Meggitts performance during a three year period commencing at the beginning of the financial year in which the award is made the measurement period.
Performance is measured by comparing the Total Shareholder Return TSR achieved by Meggitt with that of other companies in a comparator group chosen by the Remuneration Committee.
The fair value of the award is measured using a Monte Carlo model.
The assumptions used in the model with regard to expected dividend yield, expected volatility and risk free rate of return were consistent with those disclosed above in calculating the fair value of the options.
The share price at the date the award was made was 318.50 pence 2004: 272.00 pence and the fair value of the award was 2,330,000 2004: 1,011,000.
Treasury shares Treasury shares represent shares in the Company that are held by an independently managed Employee Share Ownership Plan which was formed to purchase shares to be used to meet certain of the Companys future obligations in respect of employee share schemes as described in the Remuneration Report on page 36.
At 31 December 2005 the trust held 75,944 ordinary shares 2004: 93,747 shares of which 6,227 were allocated to the Meggitt 1996 Executive Share Option Schemes 2004: 24,030 shares and 69,717 were unallocated 2004: 69,717 being retained by the Trust for future use.
The shares were purchased in prior years and have a cost of 21,000 at 31 December 2005 2004: 39,000.
The market value of the shares at 31 December 2005 was 275,000 2004: 245,000 representing 0.02% of the issued share capital of the Company 2004: 0.02%.
The Group retains the full benefit of these shares until such time as participating employees exercise their options.
The trustee has also purchased shares in respect of share schemes where the Group has had no benefit accruing to it from the dates of purchase.
Amounts owing in relation to these shares are disclosed under other receivables see note 25.

Contractual commitments 2005 2004 000 000 Capital Commitments Contracted for but not incurred property, plant & equipment 8,851 2,547 Operating lease commitments The Group leases various factories, warehouses and offices under non-cancellable operating leases.
These leases have various lease periods, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
Additionally, the Group also leases various items of plant and machinery under cancellable operating leases.
The expenditure on operating leases is charged to the income statement as incurred and is disclosed in note 7.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2005 2004 000 000 Not later than one year 1,127 776 Later than one year and not later than five years 5,647 5,350 Later than five years 49,972 56,572 56,746 62,698 Other financial commitments The Group enters into long-term arrangements with Aircraft and or Original Equipment Manufacturers OEMs to design, develop and supply products to them for the life of the aircraft.
This represents a significant long term financial commitment for the Group and requires the consideration of a number of uncertainties including the feasibility of the product solution and the ultimate commercial viability over a period which can extend over 40 years.
The directors are satisfied that, at this time, there are no significant unprovided contingent liabilities arising from these commitments.

Goodwill on acquisitions is based upon a provisional allocation of fair values.
These fair values, including the identification and measurement of intangible assets arising on the acquisition will be finalised during 2006.
No individual acquisition is considered significant.
The acquired businesses in total contributed revenues of 5.3 million and a profit before taxation of 0.3 million to the Group results for the year.
The acquired businesses would have contributed an additional 16.0 million of revenues and 2.2 million of net operating profits had they been part of the Group from 1 January 2005.

Additionally in December 2004 three businesses Wilcoxon Research US Inc. Schreiner Canada Limited and, from Eaton Aerospace LLC, the assets and business of certain flight-lock actuators for Boeing aircraft were acquired.
At 31 December 2004 the Group had allocated provisional fair values to the net assets acquired as a result of these acquisitions.
The Group finalised these fair values in 2005 including any adjustments arising from the transition to IFRS.
In accordance with IFRS 3 these amendments have been recorded as though they were made in 2004.

The principal adjustment relates to the recognition, separately from goodwill of other intangibles that meet the definition of an intangible asset and whose fair value can be measured reliably.
The intangible assets recognised comprise customer relationships 130.8 million, technology 34.1 million, order backlog 5.8 million and tradenames and trademarks 6.3 million.
These intangible assets are being amortised over their estimated useful lives.
b. IFRS 3 requires finished goods to be valued at selling prices less costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort.
Work in progress WIP is valued at selling prices less costs to complete, costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the work yet to be completed.
This inventory was all sold in the period to 31 December 2004. c. This relates to the restatement of the pension deficit in accordance with IAS 19 following the transition to IFRS.
d. Other adjustments include the recognition of contract liabilities, review of development cost carrying values in accordance with the Groups policy, and purchase price adjustments.
During the year the Group received a net payment of 16.0 million.
The amount related primarily to an amount of consideration held in escrow pending resolution of certain ongoing commercial issues and to normal adjustments on finalisation of the acquisition accounts.
Other acquisitions The adjustments made in finalising the fair value adjustments for the other three acquisitions in aggregate are analysed as follows: Recognition of intangibles Other a adjustments Total 000 000 000 Goodwill 6,008 1,319 4,689 Development costs 172 172 Other intangible assets 7,924 7,924 Property, plant and equipment 104 104 Inventories 195 195 Trade and other receivables current 209 209 Trade and other payables current 425 425 Deferred tax liabilities 1,916 42 1,958 Provisions non-current 172 172 Net assets a.

Meggitt PLC report and accounts 2005 75 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 44.
Transition to IFRS The main changes for the Group arising from the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are as follows: a.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations with effect from 1 January 2004.
The effects of IFRS 3 for the Group are: i.
Goodwill is no longer amortised.
Accordingly amortisation previously recorded in the year ended 31 December 2004 under UK GAAP has been reversed.
For acquisitions after 1 January 2004 the Group now identifies, separately from goodwill, the fair value of intangible assets that meet the IFRS 3 criteria to be recognised including customer relationships, technology, tradenames and order backlogs.
These intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives to the income statement.
Previously these intangible assets were not recognised separately from goodwill.
Accordingly it is necessary to reclassify the fair values of such intangibles from goodwill and record the amortisation in the income statement.
When the fair values of the net assets of an acquired business are finalised the difference between those fair values and the book value of the net assets of the acquired business are recorded as though they had arisen on the date the acquisition was completed.
Under UK GAAP any adjustments arising from the finalisation of fair values were recorded in the period in which they were made.
Accordingly the balance sheet at 31 December 2004 needs to be adjusted to reflect fair value adjustments identified in 2005 relating to acquisitions completed in 2004. iv.
Following the acquisition of a business IFRS requires the fair value of inventory acquired to be measured differently from UK GAAP.
Under IFRS profit attributable to finished goods and work in progress at completion is included in the fair value of the acquisition rather than in the post acquisition trading profit.
Under UK GAAP acquired finished goods and WIP were carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value and thus included no profit element.
On transition to IFRS adjustments need to be made to goodwill and inventory to reflect the IFRS method of determining fair value.
The income statement needs to be adjusted to reflect as an expense this increase in the value of inventory as it is utilised by the Group.
Under IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date a final dividend is only recognised as a liability when it is approved by the shareholders.
Accordingly it is necessary to eliminate final dividends that were previously recognised as a liability under UK GAAP but for which shareholder approval had not been received.
c. IAS 19 Employee Benefits requires the deficits on the Groups defined benefit pension schemes to be recorded on the Group balance sheet.
Accordingly the balance sheet needs to be adjusted to include such deficits and eliminate any balances previously recognised under UK GAAP.
The charge to the income statement under IAS 19 comprises three components, a service cost, the expected return on pension scheme assets and the unwinding cost of interest on pension scheme liabilities.
Accordingly the income statement needs to be adjusted to include these costs and eliminate any costs previously recognised under UK GAAP.
d. IFRS 2 Share-based Payment requires an expense to be recognised in the income statement for all forms of share based payment including options, long term incentive plans and sharesave schemes.
Previously an expense was only recognised under UK GAAP where there was a cash cost to the Group of providing the share scheme.
