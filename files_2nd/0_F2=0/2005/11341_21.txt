Exceptional charges income recognised in operating costs comprise the following: Year ended Year ended 30 April 2005 30 April 2004 '000 '000 Continuing operations: Other operating charges - reorganisation costs 6,945 8,314 - property and other provisions 1,171 859 Wages and salaries - provision for NI contribution on unapproved share option scheme 51 1,266 - UITF17 provision for discount on share options 463 3,727 8,528 14,166 The tax effect of allowable exceptional items is set-off against the profits of other Group companies.
During the year, the Group granted a number of share options under the Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 to certain employees at the market value of the Companys shares at the date of grant.
These shares are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of the grant.
Exercise of a proportion of these shares is subject to share price performance criteria.
Discounts on options granted under the Groups Savings Related Share Option Scheme do not attract a profit and loss charge as permitted by UITF17.
The Group has provided for the expected National Insurance liability arising on its unapproved 1999 Scheme.
It is estimated that if the share price were to increase by 10%, this would lead to a 198,000 increase, being 195,000 in relation to the increase in share price and 3,000 due to additional share options becoming eligible for exercise.
Similarly, if the share price were to decrease by 10%, this would lead to a 193,000 reduction in the provision, being 193,000 in relation to the decrease in the share price and nil due to share options becoming no longer eligible for exercise.
