Prior year adjustments In accordance with UITF 38 The reclassification of own shares, held by ESOP trusts, from fixed asset investments to equity has reduced net assets and equity shareholders funds by $64 million as at 31 March 2004 and $58 million as at 1 April 2003.
The profit on selling own shares is no longer recognised in the profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses.
This reduces profit from exceptional items, and therefore profit before tax, profit after tax and the total recognised gains by $23 million for the year to 31 March 2004.
In accordance with UITF 17 The reversal of the amortisation charge based on the cost of shares purchased and the inclusion of a charge based on the intrinsic value of the shares at the date of grant had no material effect on the profit and loss account for the current period or for the year to 31 March 2004.
The effect on years prior to the comparative period is to decrease retained profits by $6 million.
Statement of total recognised gains and losses The prior year adjustments of $29 million included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses comprise the reversal of the exceptional profit on sale of own shares of $23 million and an increase in share scheme charges relating to earlier years of $6 million.
Earnings per share The reversal of the exceptional profit on sale of own shares of $23 million in the year to 31 March 2004 has had the effect of reducing basic earnings per share on total operations from 193 cents to 186 cents, and diluted earnings per share from 175 cents to 168 cents.
There is no change to earnings per share before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items or to underlying earnings per share.
Cash flow statement The transfer of net disposals of own shares from the capital expenditure and financial investment line to the financing line was $14 million for the year to 31 March 2004.

This combines the amortisation of fixed asset investments in prior periods, relating to own shares, and the amortisation of share award costs of shares to be issued.
Reconciliation of movements in equity shareholders funds The prior year adjustment to the opening equity shareholders funds in the comparative period of $58 million relates to the reclassification of own shares from fixed asset investments to equity shareholders funds as at 1 April 2003.
