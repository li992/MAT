Notes to the Group Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2005 1 Accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
A Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRIC interpretations collectively IFRSs as adopted by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act, 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modied by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value.
The Group has made use of the exemption available under IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards from applying IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement retrospectively from 1 January 2005.
The policies applied to financial instruments for 2004 and 2005 are disclosed separately below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
On transition to IFRS, the group has undertaken advantage of the following exemptions contained within IFRS 1: Financial instruments: IAS 32 and IAS 39 have been adopted from 1 January 2005, with no restatement of comparative information.
Share-based payment: The Group has applied IFRS 2 Share-based Payment to equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 2005.
Foreign currency translation reserve: Cumulative translation differences on foreign currency denominated operations are deemed to be nil at 1 January 2004.
Any gains and losses recognised in the income statement on subsequent disposals of foreign operations will therefore exclude translation differences arising prior to transition date.
B Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Aggreko plc and all its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has the power to govern financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding that confers more than half of the voting rights.
C Revenue recognition Revenue for the Group represents the amounts earned from the supply of temporary power, temperature control, oil-free compressed air and related services and excludes sales taxes and intra-group revenue.
Revenue is recognised through the rental period the equipment and related services are utilised by the customer.
D Segmental reporting Aggrekos primary reporting format relates to geographical segments comprising Northern Europe, South & Central Europe, North America, Middle East, Asia-Pacic and South America together the Groups Local business and a global segment of International Power Projects IPP.
IPP is managed as a single segment, with the deployment of assets varying from year to year depending on the location of projects.
The geographical risks and rewards within IPP are signicantly different from those within the Groups Local business.
Aggrekos secondary reporting format relates to the Groups two business types detailed above, namely the Local business and International Power Projects business.
The Local business focuses on smaller, more frequently occurring events, whereas the International Power Projects business concentrates on large contracts, which can arise anywhere in the world.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 63 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2005 1 Accounting policies continued D Segmental reporting continued The risks and rewards of the Groups operations are determined by the different geographical locations.
This is reected by the Groups divisional management and organisational structure and the Groups internal financial reporting systems.
The segmented analysis in Note 5 to the Accounts is based on location of assets.
Central administration costs are allocated between segments based on revenue.
E Leases Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group are classied as operating leases.
Rentals under operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
F Exceptional items Items are classied as exceptional gains or losses where they are considered by the Group to be material and are different from events or transactions which fall within the ordinary activities of the Group and which individually, or if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to be properly understood.
Details of the exceptional items are provided in Note 8 to the financial statements.
G Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes purchase price, and directly attributable costs of bringing the asset into the location and condition where it is capable for use.
Borrowing costs are not capitalised.
Freehold properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over 25 years.
Short leasehold properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over the terms of each lease.
Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of each asset over its useful life from the date it is available for use.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
The periods of depreciation are reviewed on an annual basis and the principal periods used are as follows: Rental eet 8 to 10 years Vehicles, plant and equipment 4 to 15 years H Capital Grants Capital grants in respect of additions to property, plant and equipment are netted against the cost of the related asset and this cost is depreciated in accordance with the policy in note 1G.
I Intangibles Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specic software.
These costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is currently deemed to be 4 years and is reviewed on an annual basis.
J Impairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets Property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets are amortised and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is calculated using estimated cashows.
These are discounted using an appropriate long-term pre tax interest rate.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiable cash ows cash-generating units.
64 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 1 Accounting policies continued K Foreign currencies Items included in the financial statements for each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates functional currency.
The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Groups presentational currency.
At individual company level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the day the transaction occurs.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets are translated at the historical rate.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at closing rates of exchange.
Income and cash ow statements are translated at average rates of exchange for the period.
Gains and losses from the settlement of transactions and gains and losses on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are included in the income statement.
L Derivative financial instruments Prior to implementing IAS 39 from 1 January 2005, derivative financial instruments that were used as hedges were held off balance sheet with unrecognised gains and losses and fair values reported in the notes to the financial statements.
Fair values were based on market prices of these instruments at the balance sheet date.
For interest rate swaps, amounts payable or receivable in respect of these agreements were recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the debt they were hedging.
For forward contracts, the cash ows were classied in a manner consistent with the underlying nature of the hedged transaction.
Hence, unrealised gains and losses on contracts hedging forecast transactions were not accounted for until the maturity of the contract.
The Group accounts for financial instruments under IAS 32 and IAS 39.
IAS 39 requires the fair value of all derivative financial instruments to be recognised on the balance sheet.
IFRS 1 allows that, for the year ended 31 December 2004, derivative financial instruments can continue to be accounted for under UK GAAP.
Aggreko is taking advantage of this exemption and therefore IAS 39 will be applied prospectively from 1 January 2005.
To reect the adoption of IAS 39, there is an adjustment of 0.6 million to equity on 1 January 2005 to bring the fair value of the derivative financial instruments on balance sheet.
The activities of the Group expose it directly to the financial risks of changes in forward foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recorded and subsequently measured at fair value, which is calculated using standard industry valuation techniques in conjunction with observable market data.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps are calculated as the present value of estimated future cash ows using market interest rates and the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward foreign exchange market rates at the reporting date.
The treatment of changes in fair value of derivatives depends on the derivative classication.
The Group designates derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions or commitments cash ow hedge.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an on-going basis.
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 65 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2005 1 Accounting policies continued Cash ow hedge Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated, and effective, as hedges of future cash ows are recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash ow hedge of a rm commitment or forecasted transaction subsequently results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit and loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that time any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Overseas net investment hedges Certain foreign currency borrowings are designated as hedges of the Groups overseas net investments, which are denominated in the functional currency of the reporting operation.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the net investment in foreign entities and of borrowings are taken to equity on consolidation to the extent the hedges are deemed effective.
All other exchange gains and losses are dealt with through the income statement.
M Taxation Deferred Tax Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, negative goodwill nor from the acquisition of an asset, which does not affect either taxable or accounting income.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Provision for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings, principally relating to subsidiaries, is only made where there is a current intention to remit such earnings.
66 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 1 Accounting policies continued Current Tax The charge for the current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using taxation rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
N Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, using the FIFO or weighted average cost basis.
Cost includes the cost of direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Inventory is written down on a case by case basis if the anticipated net realisable value declines below the carrying amount of the inventories.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less cost to completion and selling expenses.
When the reasons for a write-down of the inventory have ceased to exist, the write-down is reversed.
O Employee benets Wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benets are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group.
Where the Group provides long-term employee benets, the cost is accrued to match the rendering of the services by the employees concerned.
The Group operates a dened benefit pension scheme and a number of dened contribution pensions schemes.
The cost for the year for the dened benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full, directly in retained earnings, in the period in which they occur and are shown in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The current service cost of the pension charge as well as the expected return on pension scheme assets and interest on pension scheme liabilities are included in arriving at operating profit.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the dened benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash ows using interest rates of highquality corporate bonds.
Contributions to dened contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they become chargeable.
P Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
An allowance is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
Q Trade payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 67 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2005 1 Accounting policies continued R Provisions Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to an outow of resources that can be reasonably estimated.
Provisions are recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to arise, taking into account the time value of money where material.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events, or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability.
Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inow of economic benets is probable.
S Share-based payments IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions of the standard.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees under the terms of the Groups various employee-share and option schemes.
Equity-settled sharebased payments are measured at fair value at the date of the grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for employee sharesave options and using the Monte Carlo option-pricing model for Executive share options.
Own shares held under trust for the Groups employee share schemes are classed as Treasury shares and deducted in arriving at shareholders equity.
No gain or loss is recognised on disposal of Treasury shares.
Purchases of own shares are disclosed as changes in shareholders equity.
T Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and time, call and current balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignicant risk of changes in value and have a maturity of three months or less.
This denition is also used for the cashow statement.
U Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate.
V Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
W Key assumptions and significant judgements The Group use estimates and make judgements in the preparation of its Accounts.
The most sensitive areas affecting the Accounts are discussed below.
Pensions Pension arrangements vary for our employees and schemes reect best practice and regulation in each country.
The Group operates a dened benefit scheme for UK employees, which was closed to new employees joining the group after 1 April 2002, as well as a number of dened contribution schemes.
Under IAS 19 Employee Benets the Group has recognised a pre tax pension deficit of 16.8 million at 31 December 2005 2004: 10.2 million.
The increase in the pension deficit is mainly as a result of a change in discount rate, ination and longevity assumptions.
The main assumptions used in the IAS 19 valuation for the previous two years are shown in note 28 of the Accounts.
68 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 1 Accounting policies continued Taxation The Groups tax charge is based on the profit for the year and tax rates in force at the balance sheet date.
Estimation of the tax charge requires an assessment to be made of the potential tax treatment of certain items which will only be resolved once nally agreed with the relevant tax authorities.
Property, plant and equipment The property, plant and equipment used in the business is mainly the rental eet which has a depreciation life typically of between 8 and 10 years.
The annual depreciation charge is sensitive to the estimated service lives allocated to each type of asset.
Assets lives are reviewed regularly and changed when necessary to reect current thinking on their remaining lives in light of technological change, prospective economic utilisation and the physical condition of the assets.
X Financial risk management The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include liquidity, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and credit risk.
The Group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to ensure that adequate liquidity is available to meet the Groups funding requirements as they arise, and that financial risk arising from the Groups underlying operations is effectively identied and managed.
The treasury operations are conducted in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board and are reviewed annually.
Financial instruments are only executed for hedging purposes and transactions that are speculative in nature are expressly forbidden.
Monthly reports are provided to senior management and treasury operations are subject to periodic internal and external review.
Liquidity and funding The Group maintains sufficient facilities to meet its normal funding requirements over the medium term.
These facilities are primarily in the form of bank facilities arranged on a bilateral basis with a number of international banks.
The Group does not consider that the financial covenants contained in the facilities are restrictive to its operations.
The Groups borrowings were 111.2 million at 31 December 2005, and net debt amounted to 102.9 million.
At that date undrawn committed facilities were 98.3 million.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to minimise the exposure to interest rates by ensuring an appropriate balance of xed and oating rates.
The Groups primary funding is at oating rates through its bank facilities.
In order to manage the associated interest rate risk, the Group uses interest rate swaps to vary the mix of xed and oating rates.
At 31 December 2005 61.8 million of the net debt of 102.9 million was at xed rates of interest resulting in a xed to oating rate net debt ratio of 60:40 2004: 77:23.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is subject to currency exposure on the translation of its net investments in overseas subsidiaries into sterling.
In order to reduce the currency risk arising, the Group uses direct borrowings in the same currency as those investments.
Group borrowings are currently drawn down in the principal currencies affecting the Group, namely US dollar and euro, as well as sterling.
The Group manages its currency ows to minimise foreign exchange risk arising on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and uses forward contracts where appropriate in order to hedge net currency ows.
Counterparty and credit risk Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on amounts due from counterparties.
The Group manages this risk by limiting the aggregate amounts and their duration depending on external credit ratings of the relevant counterparty.
In the case of financial assets exposed to credit risk, the carrying amount in the balance sheet, net of any applicable provisions for loss, represents the amount exposed to credit risk.
Insurance The Group operates a policy of partial self insurance although the majority of cover is placed in the external market.
The Group monitors its insurance arrangements in such a way to ensure the quality and extent of cover.
Principal areas of cover are general liability, property damage, directors and ofcers liability and political risk.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 69 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2005 2 Transition to IFRS 2.1 Basis of transition to IFRS The Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 are the first annual financial statements that comply with IFRS.
These financial statements have been prepared as described in Note 1A.
The comparative gures for 2004 have been restated accordingly and Note 2.2 contains reconciliations to the previously reported gures.
The Groups transition date is 1 January 2004.
The Group prepared its opening IFRS balance sheet at that date.
The reporting date of these consolidated financial statements is 31 December 2005.
The Groups IFRS adoption date is 1 January 2005.
2.2 Reconciliations between IFRS and UK GAAP The following reconciliations provide a quantication of the effect of the transition to IFRS and provide details of the impact of the transition on: net income for the period ended 31 December 2004 equity at 1 January 2004 equity at 31 December 2004 Reconciliation of net income 31 Dec 2004 Notes million profit for the period from continuing operations under UK GAAP 18.8 Share-based payment j 0.2 Goodwill amortisation h 0.2 Pensions g 0.3 Depreciation on previously capitalised UK GAAP redeployment costs i 0.2 Deferred tax on above adjustments k 0.1 profit for the period from continuing operations under IFRS 18.8 70 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 2 Transition to IFRS continued Reconciliation of equity at 1 January 2004 date of transition to IFRS The effect of the changes to the Groups accounting policies on the equity of the Group at 1 January 2004 was as follows.

b Under UK GAAP, capital grants were included in deferred income and matched with the related depreciation.
Under IFRS capital grants are netted against the costs of the related asset 1 January 2004: 0.3m, 31 December 2004: 0.5m.
c Current corporate tax balances, previously netted off and included within other creditors falling due within one year 1 January 2004: 1.6m, 31 December 2004: 3.4m, have been reclassied to current tax assets 1 January 2004: 1.3m, 31 December 2004: 3.2m and current tax liabilities 1 January 2004: 2.9m, 31 December 2004: 6.6m and shown separately on the face of the balance sheet.
d Deferred corporate tax balances, previously netted off and included within non-current provisions for liabilities and charges 1 January 2004: 27.1m, 31 December 2004: 22.2m have been reclassied to non-current deferred tax assets 1 January 2004: 0.1m, 31 December 2004: 0.2m and non-current deferred tax liabilities 1 January 2004: 27.2m, 31 December 2004: 22.4m and shown separately on the face of the balance sheet.
e Provisions for liabilities and charges due within one year, previously presented within non-current liabilities in accordance with UK GAAP, have been reclassied and shown within current liabilities 1 January 2004: nil, 31 December 2004: 3.7m.
None of the above reclassications have any effect on the Groups previously reported net assets or shareholders equity.
IFRS measurement adjustments f Dividends: dividends in respect of the Groups ordinary shares declared after the balance sheet date are not accrued in the balance sheet as required by IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date.
Previously under UK GAAP, such dividends were accrued in the balance sheet.
g Employee benets: pensions and other post retirement benets have been accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 which requires recognition of the operating and nancing costs of the dened benefit pension scheme in the income statement.
IAS 19 also requires recognition of any actuarial gains and losses in full immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Accordingly the pension scheme deficit is included as a liability in the balance sheet.
Previously, under UK GAAP, the Groups policy was to recognise a charge for its dened benefit pension scheme in arriving at operating profit.
This cost comprised the regular cost of providing pensions and a charge or credit relating to the amortisation of actuarial gains and losses over the average remaining service lives of the employees covered by the scheme.
The difference between the cumulative charge for pensions and cumulative contributions paid in respect of those arrangements was previously recognised as an asset or liability in the balance sheet.
Under IFRS a provision has been established for a statutory employee termination benefit scheme in France.
Under UK GAAP no provision for this scheme was required.
h Business combinations: The Group has not taken the IFRS 1 exemption for business combinations and has instead revisited the balance sheets acquired as part of previous business combinations, separately identifying each intangible asset and assessing useful lives for each.
An adjustment has been made to the carrying value of certain intangible assets to reect each individual useful life.
Goodwill was amortised under UK GAAP over its useful economic life, but under IFRS 3 is now reviewed for impairment on an annual basis and no longer amortised.
i Property, plant & equipment: under IFRS, certain costs of redeploying rental assets which were previously capitalised under UK GAAP are no longer capitalised.
An adjustment has been made to reverse the related carrying value of property, plant and equipment against retained earnings.
j Share-based payments: under IFRS 2, a charge is required for all share-based payments including share options.
The charge in the income statement is based on the fair value of the options at the date of grant.
There was no charge for Aggreko under UK GAAP.
k Deferred tax has been calculated in accordance with IAS 12 and arises on temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 73 Notes to the Group Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2005 2 Transition to IFRS continued Group Cash Flow Statement under IFRS The Group Cash Flow Statement prepared in accordance with FRS 1 revised presents substantially the same information as that required under IFRS.
Under IFRS, however, there are certain differences from UK GAAP with regard to the classication of items within the cash ow statement and with regard to the denition of cash and cash equivalents.
Under UK GAAP, cash ows are presented separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investment, equity dividends paid, management of liquid resources and nancing.

These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

The principal benchmark rates for oating rate financial liabilities are the relevant LIBOR London Interbank Offered Rate rates for sterling, US dollars and euros and liabilities are normally xed in advance for periods between one and three months.
The weighted average interest rate on xed debt is derived from the xed leg of each interest rate swap.
The effect of the Groups interest rate swaps is to classify 61.8 million 2004: 63.1 million of borrowings in the above table as xed rate.

The movement in the hedging reserve is shown in the Statement of Changes in Equity Note 25.
Under the basis of preparation in the accounting policies it is noted that IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement have only been adopted from 1 January 2005, with no restatement of comparative information.
As a result the disclosures given below relate to both IAS 32 39 and FRS 13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
i Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2005.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
2005 2004 Book Fair Book Fair value value value value million million million million Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations: Current borrowings and overdrafts 9.5 9.5 6.8 6.8 Non-current borrowings 101.7 101.7 83.2 83.2 Short-term deposits 0.4 0.4 0.5 0.5 Cash at bank and in hand 7.9 7.9 7.4 7.4 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate prole: Interest rate swaps 0.6 0.2 Forward foreign currency contracts 0.6 0.4 ii Summary of methods and assumptions Interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts Fair value is based on market price of these instruments at the balance sheet date.
Current borrowings and overdrafts Short-term deposits The fair value of short-term deposits and current borrowings and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Non-current borrowings In the case of bank loans and other loans, the fair value approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are oating rate where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.

These will be allotted to the cost of the asset as a basis adjustment when the forecast capital expenditure occurs.
The net fair value gains at 31 December 2005 on open interest swaps that hedge interest risk are 0.6 million These will be credited to the income statement over the remaining life of each interest rate swap.
The table below shows the extent to which the Group had in 2004 off-balance sheet unrecognised gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning and end of the year.
It also shows the amount of such gains and losses which have been included in the income statement for the year.
All the gains and losses on maturity of the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions or positions.

As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences of nil relate to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries which pay tax at rates less than the UK rate of tax.
If the earnings were remitted no tax would be payable 2004: nil, due to the availability of offsetting foreign tax credits.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities prior to off setting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12 during the period are shown below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related deferred tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of 1.2 million in respect of losses amounting to 3.8 million that can be carried forward against future taxable income.

Share options The options under the Savings-Related Share Option Schemes have been granted at a discount of 20% on the share price calculated over the three days prior to the date of invitation to participate, mature after three to five years and are normally exercisable in the six months following the maturity date.
The options under the US Stock Purchase Plan have been granted at a discount of 15% of the share price on the date of grant, mature after two years and are normally exercisable in the six months following the maturity date.
The options under the Executive Share Option Scheme are normally only exercisable once three years have elapsed from date of grant and lapse after ten years.
All Executive Options are subject to performance conditions based on both total shareholder return TSR and growth in Earnings Per Share EPS.
TSR is calculated by reference to the increase in the Companys share price plus dividends paid.
EPS is Basic Earnings Per Share as disclosed in the consolidated income statement.
At the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option, the growth in the Companys TSR is compared to that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts over a specified period.
If the Companys TSR matches or exceeds that index, and the Companys EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3 per cent per annum, over three consecutive years, the option is capable of exercise.
Retesting of performance conditions is limited to six monthly intervals between 3 and 5 years after the date of grant.
There is no legal obligation upon the Company to satisfy the options existing under the Savings-Related and Executive Share Option Schemes other than by the allotment of new issue shares.
It is intended to satisfy awards to US participants in the Long Term Incentive plan by the allotment of new shares.
The maximum award would be made on achieving the performance targets set out on page 50 of the Remuneration Report.
