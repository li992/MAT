The Notice of Meeting is contained in a separate letter from the Chairman accompanying this Annual Report.
GOING CONCERN Whilst any consideration of future matters involves making a judgment, at a particular point in time, about future events which are inherently uncertain, after making inquiries, the Directors have formed the judgment, at the time of approving these financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
By order of the Board B. Louise Ruppel 395 King Street Company Secretary Aberdeen 10 May 2005 AB24 5RP DIRECTORS RESPONSIBILITIES United Kingdom Company law requires that the Directors prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: and state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for the system of internal control, for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
