Foreign currency holdings and borrowings An analysis by currency of Group net cash at the year end is as follows:- Net cash Net cash balance at balance at 30th June 30th June 2005 2004 Currency 000 000 Pounds Sterling 66,208 69,101 US Dollar 11,253 11,836 Japanese Yen 10,605 9,296 Euro 13,642 14,230 Other 636 906 30,072 32,833 The carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturities of the deposits and borrowings, all of which are less than one year.
Interest rates are floating and based on libor libid.
Net assets and associated borrowings at the year end were:- As noted in the Operating and financial review on page 12, the Group maintains foreign currency borrowings as a method of providing hedging against the currency translation risk of the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries.
The level of hedging in place at the year end for the major currencies and their relative base borrowing interest rates, were as follows:- Currency Currency Base borrowing Net assets of borrowing interest rate subsidiary 000 % 000 US Dollar 15,140 3.2% 16,182 Japanese Yen 12,215 0.1% 12,069 Euro 17,070 2.0% 17,629 The currency borrowings are short-term, with floating interest rates.
In order to minimise the cost of these borrowings, short-term currency swaps are used on a rolling one-month cycle.
These currency swaps are not reflected in the table above.
