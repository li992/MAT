Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued At 31 December 2005 29 Financial instruments Risk management objectives and policies The groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, loan notes, non-recourse structured finance, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the groups operations.
The group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The group also uses derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps and caps, and forward currency contracts to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is the groups policy that no trading in financial instruments be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk The groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the groups long-term variable rate debt obligations and its cash and bank balances.
The groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt and specifically to keep between 60% and 80% of its borrowings at fixed or capped rates of interest.
At 31 December 2005, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps and caps, approximately 84.7% 2004: 67.6% of the groups term borrowings are at a fixed or capped rate of interest.
Foreign currency risk The group uses forward currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposure on transactions significant to its operations.
It is the groups policy not to enter into forward contracts until a firm commitment is in place and to negotiate the terms of the hedge derivatives to match the terms of the hedged item to maximise hedge effectiveness.
Credit risk The group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the groups exposure to bad debts is not considered significant.
At 31 December 2005, the groups five largest customers accounted for 69.8% of outstanding trade receivables and work in progress 2004: 62.6%.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, available-forsale financial assets and certain derivative instruments, the groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
Liquidity risk The groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, revolving credit facilities, project finance and term loans.
Fair values The fair value of the groups financial instruments as compared to their carrying amounts included within the groups balance sheet are set out below: Carrying amount Fair value 2005 2004 2005 2004 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 Financial assets Cash and short-term deposits 208,896 143,534 208,896 143,534 Restricted cash 1,648 17,678 1,648 17,678 Available-for-sale financial assets 2,413 4,104 2,413 4,104 Interest rate caps and swaps 672 53 672 53 Forward currency contracts 23,712 23,712 Forward currency purchase option 461 461 Other non-current financial assets 8 4,720 8 4,720 Other current financial assets 2,392 2,885 2,392 2,885 Financial liabilities Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 106,870 161,478 106,870 162,404 Deferred consideration 4,450 4,450 4,450 4,450 Interest rate swaps 147 210 147 210 Forward currency contracts 11,452 12 11,452 12 Other non-current financial liabilities 125 2,217 125 2,217 Other current financial liabilities 858 1,263 858 1,263 Market values have been used to determine the fair values of available-for-sale financial assets and forward currency contracts.
The fair values of interest rate swaps and caps have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
78 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2005 Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect the value of the groups interest-bearing financial liabilities and assets.
