Reconciliation of Net Income for the year ended 31 December 2004 Effect of UK GAAP in transition IFRS Format to IFRS IFRS Note 000 000 000 Continuing operations Revenue 366,954 366,954 Cost of sales 304,157 304,157 Gross profit 62,797 62,797 Operating expenses i ii iii 39,234 4,300 34,934 Share of loss of associates 245 245 Operating profit 23,318 4,300 27,618 Finance costs 2,278 2,278 Finance income 815 815 Profit before taxation 21,855 4,300 26,155 Taxation iii 8,070 120 7,950 Profit for the period 13,785 4,420 18,205 Attributable to: Equity holders of the Company 14,443 4,420 18,863 Minority Interest 658 658 13,785 4,420 18,205 i Goodwill: Goodwill is subject to impairment testing under IFRS rather than the amortisation rules applied under UK GAAP.
The impact of the reversal of the UK GAAP amortisation is to increase profit for the period by 5,668,000.
This is partially offset by an IFRS impairment charge in the period of 534,000. ii Intangible assets: IFRS requires intangible assets, where meeting the IFRS definition and where fair value can be measured reliably, to be recognised separately from goodwill.
A value of 560,000, subsumed in goodwill at date of acquisition of IADC Ltd under UK GAAP, has been provisionally attributed to intangible assets.
Amortisation of 260,000 has been recognised in the period.
iii Retirement benefit obligations: IFRS requires the pension schemes deficits on the defined benefit pension plans to be recognised on the Groups balance sheet at date of transition.
The Group has elected to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in full as they arise in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The impact is an increase in pension expense in the period of 674,000.
Pension prepayments carried under UK GAAP were written back and the related deferred tax reversed on transition to IFRS, increasing profit for the period by a net 220,000.
