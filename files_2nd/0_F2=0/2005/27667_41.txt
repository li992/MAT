There are no restrictions on property, plant and equipment title as a result of security pledges.
The revaluation of land and buildings relates to the African long-term business, 1 million and 14 million respectively and the African banking business, 6 million and 7 million respectively.
For long-term business, land and buildings are valued as at 31 December each year by internal professional valuers and external valuations are obtained once every three years.
External professional valuers are used for the banking business.
For both businesses the valuation methodology adopted is dependent upon the nature of the property.
Income generating assets are valued using discounted cash flows and vacant land and property are valued according to sales of comparable properties.
The carrying value that would have been recognised had the land and buildings been carried under the cost model would be 25 million and 122 million respectively for the African long-term business and 21 million and 119 million for the African banking business respectively.
