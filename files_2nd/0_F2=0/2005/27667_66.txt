Fair value of share schemes and assumptions The grant date for the UK and SA Share option and Deferred Delivery plan annual awards is deemed to be 1 January in the year prior to the date of issue.
As such the Group is required to estimate, at the reporting date, the number and fair value of the options that will be granted in the following year.
The fair value of awards expected to be granted in 2006 which will have an IFRS 2 grant date of 1 January 2005, is shown separately below.
The grant date for all other awards is the award issue date.
Share options The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of share options granted is measured using a Black Scholes option pricing model.
Share options are granted under a service and non-market based performance condition.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement of the share options granted.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants.
The expected volatility is based on the annualised historic volatility of the share price over a period commensurate with the expected option life, ending on the date of valuation of the option.
The expected life assumption is based on the average length of time similar grants have remained outstanding in the past and the type of employees to whom awards have have granted.

UK and SA Share Option and deferred delivery plans annual bonus awards The level of annual bonus awards made under this plan is contingent upon the satisfactory completion of individual and company performance targets, measured over the financial year prior to the date the employees receive the award.
The grant date for the SA and UK annual bonus plans other than the new joiner and newly qualified grants has therefore been determined as 1 January in the year prior to the date of issue of the grants.
The Group estimate of the total awards to be granted in March 2006 under the South African scheme in the form of options and restricted shares is 8,900,000 and 3,700,000 respectively.
These options have been valued using the Black Scholes option pricing model, using an at the money option assumption.
The restricted shares have been valued using a share price of R19.83.
The Group estimate of the total fair value of the annual bonus expected to be paid in the form of options and restricted shares under the UK Share Option and Deferred Delivery Plan is outlined below.
The fair value is determined by making an estimate of the level of bonus to be paid out following the attainment of personal and company performance conditions.
