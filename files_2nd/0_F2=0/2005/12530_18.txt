IFRS transition reconciliations The following reconciliations provide a quantification of the effect of Premiers transition to IFRS.
The following four reconciliations provide details of the impact of the transition on: Income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004: Reconciliation of equity and net assets at 31 December 2004: Cash flows for the year ended 31 December 2004: and Reconciliation of equity and net assets at 1 January 2004.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS on the consolidated results and the financial position of Premier is addressed separately for each reconciliation.
Notes have been prepared to explain the key changes from UK GAAP to IFRS.
The basis of preparation and accounting policies for these statements is the same as given on pages 33 to 38.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2005 59 Income statement reconciliation For the year ended 31 December 2004 Notes a b c d UK GAAP Joint venture Pre-licence numbers in proportional Employee costs write Deferred IFRS format consolidation benefits back PRT $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million Sales revenues 196.0 55.8 Cost of sales 108.4 20.6 Total exploration expense 14.3 3.9 General and administration costs 15.5 1.5 Share on net income from joint ventures 23.6 23.6 Operating profit 81.4 11.6 1.5 3.9 Interest revenue and finance gains 1.9 0.1 Finance costs and other finance expenses 7.6 0.2 Profit before tax 75.7 11.5 1.5 3.9 Tax 31.9 11.5 4.5 Profit after tax 43.8 1.5 3.9 4.5 Earnings per share cent : Basic 53.0 Diluted 52.1 Notes: a Joint ventures proportional consolidation Joint venture arrangements which involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest are referred to as jointly controlled entities JCEs.
Under IFRS the group reports its interests in JCEs using proportionate consolidation, ie the groups share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of JCEs are combined with the equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Under UK GAAP the group accounted for its 50 per cent share in Premier-Kufpec Pakistan BV PKP as an interest in a joint venture under FRS 9 Associates and Joint Ventures.
FRS 9 required the group to show its proportion of operating profit or loss, exceptional items, interest, tax, gross assets and gross liabilities of the joint venture as part of the financial statements.
The change to proportional consolidation will result in a major presentational change in the way JCE balances are stated on the face of the income statement.
However, this does not result in any impact on the net profits of the group.
b Employee benefits The group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses as at 31 December 2004 on all of its long-term employee benefit schemes including funded pension plans.
The impact of this election is a US$ 1.5 million additional charge in the income statement.
c Pre-licence exploration costs IFRS requires that all pre-licence costs are written off in the year that they are incurred.
On transition to IFRS all such costs existing at 1 January 2004 were written off to shareholders funds.
Some of the costs, which remained capitalised at 1 January 2004 under UK GAAP, were written off in the UK GAAP 2004 results as the related projects were considered unsuccessful.
This adjustment reverses the impact of such write-offs in the 2004 income statement, as they had already been written off on transition, amounting to US$3.9 million.
d Deferred Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT IFRS requires that deferred PRT be calculated on a temporary difference basis, a departure from Premiers former unit of production UOP method.
This has resulted in a higher provision in the opening IFRS balance sheet and a portion US$4.5 million of the additional provision has been released during 2004 due to the reversal of temporary differences.

21.3 2.9 4.4 22.1 26.8 26.1 e Exploration expense The group has adopted an IFRS accounting policy for exploration and evaluation assets that is more aligned with the UK GAAP successful efforts accounting practice, rather than its previous UK GAAP policy of accounting for such costs under the full-cost method.
Under the successful efforts method of accounting all licence acquisition, exploration and appraisal costs are initially capitalised in well, field or general exploration cost centres as appropriate, pending determination.
Expenditure incurred during the various exploration and appraisal phases is then written off unless commercial reserves have been established or the determination process has not been completed.
Based on this new policy the group has written off certain exploration costs incurred in 2004 in Guinea Bissau, Gabon, North Sea and Mauritania, related to unsuccessful exploration wells amounting to US$23.9 million.
f Exploration and evaluation assets accounting PKP joint venture The group has adopted an IFRS accounting policy for exploration and evaluation assets that is more aligned with the UK GAAP successful efforts accounting practice, rather than its previous UK GAAP policy of accounting for such costs under the full-cost method.
In the PKP joint venture, adoption of this policy resulted in a reduced amortisation charge of US$2.4 million, additional exploration expense of US$6.6 million and a reduction in the tax charge by US$1.3 million.
g Property, plant and equipment amortisation IAS 16 requires that oil and gas property, plant and equipment is generally held in the balance sheet on a field-by-field basis.
Given the age and history of the group it has not been possible to establish accurately the depreciated historical cost base for the individual fields in the UK and Far East cost pools, therefore, we have taken benefit of the transition rules contained within IFRS 1 that allow fair values to be adopted on transition, in place of depreciated historical cost amounts.
The impact of this is an increase to fixed assets of US$122.8 million, which has increased the amortisation charge by US$8.0 million during 2004 which has been partially offset by a reduction in tax deferred tax release of US$3.6 million.
h Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Employees Share Option Plan Trust ESOP IFRS 2 requires all the shares purchased for ESOP Trusts and provisions made for any future share-based pay out to be presented within equity.
This has resulted in the movement of US$3.2 million in shareholders funds during 2004, which was due to the purchase of further shares for the plan during 2004.

The change to proportional consolidation will result in a major presentational change in the way JCE balances are stated on the face of the balance sheet.
However, this does not result in any impact on the net assets of the group.
b Employee benefits The group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses as at 1 January 2004 and the impact of this requirement is a US$ 8.8 million reduction to net assets at that date.
Additionally, under IAS 19, staff costs should reflect services performed during the period including all benefits paid in cash or shares.
This has resulted in a transfer to reserves of US$1.7 million of deferred share-based bonuses payable in one to three years from the date of the balance sheet, offset by a provision for the same amount having no net impact on shareholders funds.
In accordance with the groups UK GAAP policy, which allowed capitalisation of such costs, US$2.3 million of pre-licence costs was capitalised as part of oil and gas properties at 31 December 2004.
On transition to IFRS, all such costs existing at 31 December 2004 have been written off.
The impact of this requirement is a US$22.2 million reduction to net assets.
This has principally arisen due to PRT on the fair valuation of North West Europe assets as described further in note g. e Exploration and evaluation assets accounting PKP joint venture The group has adopted an IFRS accounting policy for exploration and evaluation assets that is more aligned with the UK GAAP successful efforts accounting practice rather than its previous UK GAAP policy of accounting for such costs under the full-cost method.
In the PKP joint venture, adoption of this policy largely required the write-off of historic exploration expenditures, pre-licence costs and a related adjustment to deferred tax due to a reduction in the fixed assets in the joint venture.
This has resulted in a net asset adjustment of US$37.8 million.
Given the age and history of the Premier group, it has not been possible to establish accurately the depreciated historical cost base for the individual fields in the Far East cost pool, therefore, we have taken benefit of the transition rules contained within IFRS 1 that allow fair values to be adopted on transition in place of depreciated historical cost amounts.
The impact of this is a net US$9.8 million increase to net assets, as the Indonesian assets are revalued upwards US$72.7 million after adjusting for past exploration costs and deferred tax has been provided on the gross fair value, together amounting to US$62.9 million.
g Property, plant and equipment North West Europe IFRS requires that fixed assets are held in the balance sheet, generally on a field-by-field basis.
Given the age and history of the Premier group, it has not been possible to establish accurately the depreciated historical cost base for the individual fields in the North West Europe cost pool, therefore, we have taken benefit of the transition rules contained within IFRS 1 that allow fair values to be adopted on transition in place of depreciated historical cost amounts.
The impact of this is a net US$30.0 million increase to net assets, as the North Sea assets are revalued upwards US$50.0 million and deferred tax has been provided on the gross fair value, together amounting to US$20.0 million.
h Exploration and evaluation assets accounting The group has adopted an IFRS accounting policy for exploration and evaluation assets that is more aligned with the UK GAAP successful efforts accounting practice rather than its previously adopted policy of accounting for such costs under the full-cost method.
Based on this new policy the group has written off certain exploration costs incurred in Guinea Bissau, Gabon, North Sea and Mauritania, related to unsuccessful exploration wells amounting to US$43.3 million with a consequent deferred tax release.
i Property, plant and equipment amortisation IAS 16 requires that fixed assets are held in the balance sheet on a field-by-field basis.
Given the age and history of the group it has not been possible to establish an accurate cost base for the individual fields in the UK and Far East cost pools, therefore, we have taken benefit of the transition rules contained within IFRS 1 that will allow fair values to be adopted.
j Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Employees Share Option Plan Trust ESOP IFRS 2 requires all the shares purchased for ESOP Trusts and provisions made for any future share-based payout to be presented within equity.
This has resulted in a transfer of US$0.2 million ESOP Trust shares to shareholders funds and a reduction of US$0.4 million in Long-Term Incentive Plan accrual.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2005 63 Cash flow reconciliation For the year ended 31 December 2004 Notes a b UK GAAP Cash PKP joint venture numbers in equivalent proportional IFRS format transfer consolidation $ million $ million $ million Operating activities: Profit before tax 75.7 11.5 Depreciation, depletion and amortisation 57.4 9.2 Total exploration expense 14.3 Increase decrease in inventories 0.1 0.3 Increase decrease in trade and other receivables 7.7 2.3 Increase decrease in trade and other payables 2.5 2.5 Interest received 2.1 0.1 Interest receivable 1.9 0.1 Interest paid 2.3 0.2 Interest payable 2.1 0.2 Other finance income 5.8 Net operating charge for long-term employee benefit plans less contributions Income taxes paid 53.7 1.2 Impairment and gain or loss on sale of investments fixed assets 0.2 Net cash provided by operating activities 94.4 15.2 Investing activities: Capital expenditure and pre-licence exploration costs 95.6 8.9 Inflow of funds from joint venture 32.2 32.2 Net cash used in investing activities 63.4 41.1 Financing activities: Issue of Ordinary Shares 5.2 Repurchase of Ordinary Shares 3.3 Repayment of long-term financing 61.2 Management of liquid resources 50.7 50.7 Net cash used in financing activities 8.6 50.7 Currency translation differences relating to cash and cash equivalents 0.1 Decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents 22.4 50.8 25.9  period 5.8 103.3 4.8 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period 28.2 52.5 21.1 Notes: a Cash equivalents UK GAAP defines cash flows to include only movements in cash cash-in-hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts.
IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements define cash flows as movements in both cash and cash equivalents, with cash equivalents defined as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
This presentational difference has no effect on the overall net cash position.
b Joint ventures proportional consolidation Joint venture arrangements which involve the establishment of a separate entity, in which each venturer has an interest, are referred to as jointly controlled entities JCEs.
Under IFRS the group will report its interests in JCEs using proportionate consolidation, ie the groups share of the cash flows of JCEs are combined with the equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
FRS 9 required the group to exclude cash flows from joint ventures and only show the amount received from, or funding provided to, such joint ventures.
This results in a major presentational change in the way JCE cash balances are stated on the face of the cash flow statement.
The group will now show net debt numbers, including its share of cash and cash equivalents, in the PKP joint ventures.
c Employee benefits Premier Oil has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses as at 31 December 2004 on all of its long-term employee benefit schemes, including funded pension plans.
The impact of this election is a US$ 1.5 million additional charge in the net profit.
However, as it is a non-cash item it has been added back to the cash flows from operating activities.

Some of the costs which remained capitalised at 1 January 2004 under UK GAAP were written off in the 2004 results as the related projects were considered unsuccessful.
This adjustment reverses the impact of such write-offs in the 2004 income statement amounting to US$3.9 million.
However, as its impact is already reflected in cash flows related to capital expenditure it has been added back to the cash flows from operating activities.
e Exploration expense The group has written off certain exploration costs incurred in 2004 in Guinea Bissau, Gabon, North Sea and Mauritania which related to unsuccessful exploration wells amounting to US$23.9 million.
However, as its impact is already reflected in cash flows related to capital expenditure, it has been added back to the cash flows from operating activities.
In the PKP joint venture, adoption of this policy resulted in a reduced amortisation charge of US$2.4 million and an additional exploration expense of US$6.6 million.
However, as amortisation is a non-cash item and exploration expense is already reflected in cash flows related to capital expenditure, both have been adjusted to the cash flows from operating activities.
g Property, plant and equipment amortisation IAS 16 requires that oil and gas property, plant and equipment is held in the balance sheet generally on a field-by-field basis.
The impact of this is an increase to fixed assets of US$122.8 million, which has increased the amortisation charge by US$8.0 million during 2004.

Under IFRS the group will report its interests in JCEs using proportionate consolidation, ie the groups share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of JCEs are combined with the equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Under UK GAAP, the group accounted for its 50 per cent share in Premier-Kufpec Pakistan BV PKP as an interest in a joint venture under FRS 9 Associates and Joint Ventures.
The change to proportional consolidation results in a major presentational change in the way JCE balances are stated on the face of the balance sheet, however, this does not result in any impact on the net assets of the group.
b Employee benefits The group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses as at 1 January 2004 and the impact of this requirement is a US$ 7.4 million reduction to net assets at that date.
Additionally, under IAS 19, staff costs should reflect services performed during the period, including all benefits paid in cash or shares.
This has resulted in a transfer to reserves of US$1.7 million of deferred sharebased bonuses payable in one to three years from the date of the balance sheet, offset by a provision for the same amount having no net impact on the shareholders funds.
c Pre-licence costs IFRS requires that all pre-licence costs are written off in the year that they were incurred.
In accordance with the groups UK GAAP policy, which allowed capitalisation of such costs, US$6.2 million of pre-licence costs were capitalised as part of exploration and evaluation assets.
On transition to IFRS all such costs existing at 1 January 2004 were written off.
The impact of this requirement is a US$ 26.6 million reduction to net assets.
This has principally arisen due to PRT on the fair valuation of North West Europe assets, as described further in note g. 66 Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2005 d e f g h i Far East North West Deferred PKP successful successful Europe Exploration Long-Term IFRS petroleum efforts efforts successful efforts costs Incentive Plan opening revenue tax adjustment adjustment adjustment write-off 2003 and ESOP Trust balance sheet $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million 19.4 14.5 54.6 72.7 50.0 554.1 11.5 54.6 72.7 50.0 19.4 580.1 12.7 4.7 118.9 113.8 4.7 245.4 54.6 72.7 50.0 19.4 4.7 825.5 8.2 93.8 46.6 8.2 140.4 99.5 26.6 19.6 62.9 20.0 219.9 20.1 8.1 26.6 19.6 62.9 20.0 347.6 26.6 19.6 62.9 20.0 8.2 488.0 26.6 35.0 9.8 30.0 19.4 3.5 337.5 73.0 3.4 26.6 35.0 9.8 30.0 19.4 3.5 261.1 26.6 35.0 9.8 30.0 19.4 3.5 337.5 e Exploration and evaluation assets accounting PKP joint venture The group has adopted an IFRS accounting policy for exploration and evaluation assets that is more aligned with the UK GAAP successful efforts accounting practice, rather than its previous UK GAAP policy of accounting for such costs under the full-cost method.
This has resulted in a net asset adjustment of US$34.9 million.
f Property, plant and equipment Far East IFRS requires that fixed assets are held in the balance sheet generally on a field-by-field basis.
Given the age and history of the group, it has not been possible to establish accurately the depreciated historical cost base for the individual fields in the Far East cost pools, therefore, we have taken the benefit of the transition rules contained within IFRS 1 that allow fair values to be adopted on transition in place of depreciated historical cost amounts.
g Property, plant and equipment North West Europe IFRS requires that fixed assets are held in the balance sheet generally on a field-by-field basis.
Given the age and history of the group, it has not been possible to establish accurately the depreciated historical cost base for the individual fields in the North West Europe cost pools, therefore, we have taken benefit of the transition rules contained within IFRS 1 that will allow fair values to be adopted on transition in place of depreciated historical cost amounts.
h Exploration and evaluation assets accounting West Africa The group has adopted an IFRS accounting policy for exploration and evaluation assets that is more aligned with the UK GAAP successful efforts accounting practice, rather than its previous UK GAAP policy of accounting for such costs under the full-cost method.
For the West Africa geographic segment, adoption of this policy largely required the write-off of historic exploration expenditures related to Guinea Bissau.
This has resulted in a net asset reduction of US$19.4 million.
i Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Employees Share Option Plan Trust ESOP IFRS 2 requires all the shares purchased for ESOP Trusts and provisions made for any future share-based payout to be presented within equity.
This has resulted in a transfer of US$4.8 million ESOP Trust shares to shareholders funds, and a reduction of US$8.2 million in Long-Term Incentive Plan accrual.
