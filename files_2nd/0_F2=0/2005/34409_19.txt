76 BRIXTON u NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS A Accounting policies i Accounting convention The Company accounts are prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP using the historical cost convention modified by the revaluation of properties.
ii Investment properties Properties are valued at the balance sheet date by the Groups external valuers.
The basis of valuation of properties is described in note D. Any surplus or deficit arising from revaluation is transferred to the revaluation reserve unless a deficit on an individual property is expected to become permanent in which case it is recognised in the profit and loss account for the year.
Interest and outgoings less rental income are capitalised on development properties during the course of development.
A property ceases to be treated as being in the course of development at the earliest of the date when the property is physically complete and becomes available for occupation or the date when the development becomes fully let and income producing.
Leasehold properties where the lease has more than 150 years to expiry are classified as freehold.
iii Depreciation In accordance with SSAP 19: Accounting for Investment Properties, no depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of freehold properties or leasehold properties with more than 20 years to run as the properties are held for investment and not for consumption.
Depreciation is provided on other fixed assets so as to write off the cost less residual value of each asset over the anticipated useful life.
iv Deferred tax In accordance with FRS 19, deferred tax is provided in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed at the balance sheet date that may give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future.
As all of the Companys investment properties are held as long-term investments, deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of those assets.
Following the sale of a property any deferred tax provision not required will be released to the profit and loss account.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
v Derivative Financial Instruments The Company enters into derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps in order to manage the risks arising from its activities as described in more detail in the Financial Review on pages 22 to 25 and in note 19.
From 1 January 2005 derivatives are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured to fair value based on market prices.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting to its derivative financial instruments and hence any change in the fair value of such derivatives is recognised immediately in the income statement as a finance cost.
vi Pensions The obligations of defined benefit pension schemes, representing benefits accruing to employees, are measured at discounted present value while scheme assets are measured at their fair value.
The discount rate used is the yield on AA credit rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the profit and loss account: service costs are spread systematically over the working lives of the employees concerned and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from either experience differing from previous actuarial assumptions or changes to those assumptions are recognised immediately in equity.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are expensed as incurred.
vii Share and share-based remuneration The cost of equity settled transactions with employees and Directors is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised in the profit and loss account as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the individuals concerned become fully entitled to the award.
The charge is reversed if it appears likely that the performance criteria will not be met.
The Company has used a stochastic option valuation model in calculating the fair value of share options awarded.
77 BRIXTON viii Changes in accounting policy Although the Group accounts have been prepared under International Financial and Reporting Standards, the individual parent Company accounts continue to be prepared under UK GAAP.
As part of the strategy of convergence with IFRS the Accounting Standards Board has issued several new accounting standards that are applicable in the UK and Ireland for years beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
Those applicable to the Company, together with their IFRS equivalents are as follows: FRS 20 IFRS 2 : Share-based payments FRS 21 IAS 10 : Events after the balance sheet date FRS 25 IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation FRS 26 IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement Descriptions of the nature of the changes necessitated by the above standards are given in note 1b and note 34 to the Group accounts and in the paragraphs below.
As in the Group IFRS accounts, the Company has applied FRS 25 and 26 from 1 January 2005 only.
No comparative figures have been restated for the impact of these standards.
However if they had been applied to prior years the fair value of the interest rate derivatives of the Company at 31 December 2004 would have been recognised at that date as a liability of 9.3m, with a related deferred tax asset of 2.8m.
Financing costs for the year ended 31 December 2004 would have included a profit of 7.8m, being the movement in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, and the tax charge would have included a related tax charge of 2.3m.
Under FRS 21 final dividends may not be recognised in the income statement or balance sheet until approved whilst interim dividends may not be recognised until paid.
Consequently the 2004 final and interim dividends have been excluded from the balance sheet at 31 December 2004, and the 2003 final and interim dividends from the balance sheet at 31 December 2003, resulting in a reduction in dividends payable per the profit and loss account of 3.6m for 2004, an increase in retained profit and net assets as at 31 December 2004 of 30.9m and a corresponding reduction in creditors at 31 December 2004 of 30.9m.
The application of FRS 20: Share-based payments to 2004 resulted in a charge of 0.2m for share options issued being made to profit after tax with a corresponding credit being recognised directly in reserves.
There was no overall balance sheet impact.
In addition to the above, FRS 17: Retirement Benefits became fully effective in 2005.
As a consequence amounts disclosed in the notes to the accounts of previous years have been provided in full in these financial statements.
This has resulted in the recognition in the balance sheet at 31 December 2004 of a defined benefit pension net liability of 1.7m, the derecognition of a pension prepayment of 3.1m and the recognition of a deferred tax asset of 0.5m.
The impact on 2004 profit after tax was a net gain of 0.5m.
In addition actuarial losses net of deferred tax recognised directly in equity in 2004 totalled 0.3m.
B Profit and loss Brixton plc has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
The profit for year attributable to shareholders dealt with in the accounts of the Company was 24.1m 2004: 31.8m.

Market value represents the figure that would appear in a hypothetical contract of sale between a willing buyer and a willing seller.
Market value is estimated without regard to costs of sale.
The historical cost of properties at 31 December 2005 was 33.2m 2004: 28.5m.
Long leasehold properties where the lease has more than 150 years to expiry included in the above analysis, amounted to 37.9m 2004: 32.6m.
Development properties at 31 December 2005, included above, amounted to 19.9m 2004: 15.8m.
E Other fixed assets Other fixed assets comprise motor vehicles, furniture and fixtures and fittings held at a cost of 3.1m 2004: 2.7m and a depreciated net book value of 1.3m 2004: 1.3m.
