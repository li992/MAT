27 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations and deposits.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using various interest related derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps.
The Group borrows in several currencies and operates a policy of fixing the interest rate on at least 25% of the book value of debt for more than 12 months.
Non-core debt and cash are kept at short-term interest rates.
At 31 December 2005, after taking account of interest rate swaps, the proportion of the Groups gross borrowings at fixed rates was 12% 2004: 40% fixed for a weighted average period of 3.7 years 2004: 2.7 years.
The annual average interest rate on fixed rate debt was 6.3% 2004: 5.2%.
The Group will review its interest rate risk policy following the disposal of the discontinued operation.
Foreign currency risk Due to the international nature of its activities, the Groups reported profits, net assets and gearing are all affected by foreign exchange movements.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of its structural currency exposure that may arise from the translation of the foreign currency assets by implementing net investment hedges in foreign currencies to match at least 50% of the foreign currency assets.
At 31 December 2005, net investment hedges represented 47% 2004: 93% of the net carrying value of foreign currency assets.
Although the Group carries out operations through a number of foreign enterprises, Group exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is minimal.
The day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are carried out in local currencies.
The foreign exchange risk of the Group will reduce following the disposal of the discontinued operation.
Also refer to note 28 for a description of the Groups hedging activities.
Commodity price risk The Groups exposure to price risk is minimal.
Credit risk The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets and derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counter party, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
This risk is managed by restricting those transactions to banks that have a defined minimum credit rating and to limit the exposure to a maximum per bank.
All derivatives are executed under agreements conforming to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA standards.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of borrowings with a range of maturities.
The Groups policy on liquidity is to ensure that there is sufficient medium and long-term committed borrowing facilities to meet the medium-term funding requirements.
At 31 December 2005, there were undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 574.1m 2004: 341.4m.
Total committed facilities had an average maturity of 3.2 years 2004: 4.5 years.
28 Financial instruments As per IFRS 1, the Group has elected not to present comparative information in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

The floating rate bond and the interest rate swap have the same critical terms.
b At 31 December 2005 the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place which had an impact of switching the fixed rate bonds to floating rate.
The fixed rate bonds and the interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
All finance lease obligations, bank overdrafts and certain of the cash assets and bank loans are part of the discontinued operation.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than 12 months.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Hedging activities Hedge of net investments in foreign operations The Group designates certain currency derivatives and certain foreign currency borrowings as a hedge against the Groups post tax exposure to foreign exchange risk on net investments in foreign operations.
The Group is party to a number of currency derivatives cross currency swaps and foreign currency swaps in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
The Group currently designates its foreign currency denominated borrowings as a post-tax hedge of net investments in foreign operations borrowings within the foreign operations in the functional currency of the foreign operation are not designated as a net investment hedging instrument.
These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures for the duration of the arrangements, and are renewed on a revolving basis as required.
At 31 December 2005, the fair value of the Groups cross currency swaps is estimated to be approximately 24.9m, comprising 442.7m assets and 467.6m liabilities.
At 31 December 2005, the fair value of the Groups foreign currency swaps is estimated to be approximately 7.7m, comprising 6.1m assets and 13.8m liabilities.
At 31 December 2005, the fair value of the Groups foreign currency borrowings that were designated as a hedging instrument is estimated to be 399.5m.
Fair value hedge The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its fair value exposure to interest rate movements on its fixed rate borrowings by swapping a proportion of those borrowings from fixed rates to floating rates.
Contracts with nominal values of 900.6m have fixed interest receipts at an average rate of 5.8% and have floating interest payments at 0.27% plus LIBOR.
The contracts are outstanding for periods up until 2012.
The fair value of these swaps entered into at 31 December 2005 is estimated at 48.8m.
Cash flow hedge The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its cash flow exposure to interest rate movements on its floating rate borrowings by swapping a proportion of those borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
As at 31 December 2005 there was one interest rate swap that qualified as a cash flow hedge.
It had a nominal value of 21.9m, fixed interest rate payable of 6.71%, floating interest rate receivable at LIBOR plus 0.89%.
The fair value of this swap at 31 December 2005 is estimated as an asset of 1.3m and the movement has been deferred in equity.
The periods in which the cash flows relating to the cash flow hedge are expected to occur are 2005-2007 and this cash flow hedge is expected to enter into the income statement during 2005-2007.
Annual Report and Accounts 67 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS continued 28 Financial instruments continued 2 UK GAAP tables for 2004 comparatives Accounting policy applied to 2004 comparatives Treasury Instruments The Group makes use of a number of derivative instruments in order to alter the risk profile of an underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups treasury management policies.
The main derivative instruments used are as follows: a Interest rate swaps: The notional principal of an interest rate swap is recorded off balance sheet.
The net interest paid or received is recognised on an accruals basis in the Groups income statement.
b Cross Currency swaps: A cross currency swap has the effect of restating the underlying currency denominated debt into the swapped currency.
The swapped currency is then recorded on the balance sheet.
The Group also uses swaps to hedge the Groups tax charge on foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities.
Short-term receivables and payables have been omitted from this note as permitted under UK GAAP.
a Interest rate risk profile as at 31 December 2004 The interest rate risk profile of the Group, after taking into account the effect of interest rate and cross currency swaps, is as follows: Financial assets Fixed rate Interest free financial financial assets assets Financial assets on which Weighted Weighted Weighted Floating no interest is average average average rate Fixed rate receivable Total interest period period 2004 m m m m rate % years years Sterling 297.36.1303.4 US Dollar 39.7 4.5 44.2 Euro 39.7 1.7 41.4 4.6 Canadian Dollar 9.2 9.2 Australian Dollar 18.1 18.1 Danish Krone 16.3 16.3 Swedish Krona 17.0 17.0 Norwegian Kroner 3.1 3.1 Swiss Franc 7.3 7.3 Other 35.6 0.6 36.2 3.7 Total 483.3 12.9 496.2 4.3 The financial assets of the Group comprise: 2004 m Cash and deposits 483.3 Trade and other receivables falling due after more than one year 7.9 Non-current assets investments 5.0 Total financial assets 496.2 i The floating rate financial assets comprise primarily cash and short-term deposits earning interest at commercial rates relevant to each functional currency.
ii Interest free financial assets include fixed asset investments which are excluded from the weighted average period calculation as they have indefinite lives.

The financial liabilities of the Group comprise: 2004 m Total borrowings and finance leases 1,455.2 Payables falling due within one year relating to derivative instruments 0.7 Other payables falling due after more than one year 15.8 Total financial liabilities 1,471.7 i The floating rate financial liabilities are at rates which fluctuate mainly dependent on LIBOR.
The average year end interest rate for such borrowings was 2.8% in 2004. ii The average year end interest rate on gross borrowings is 3.8% in 2004. iii The figures shown in note 28 2 a take into account various interest rate and currency swaps used to manage interest rate risk and the currency profile of financial liabilities.
b Foreign currency exposure profile as at 31 December 2004 The Group uses forward currency exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange exposures arising on known material receipts and payments in foreign currencies and on the translation of foreign currency net assets.
As a result, the Group does not have any significant currency exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
