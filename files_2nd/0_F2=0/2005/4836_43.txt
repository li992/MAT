Elkjp is expected to continue to maintain its market share and profitability over the long term and it is not therefore possible to identify a nite useful economic life for the goodwill of 489.9 million arising on its acquisition.
It is considered that the barriers to entry which exist in Elkjps markets, which are anticipated to continue, will prove this goodwill to be durable.
UniEuro S. p. A. UniEuro became a subsidiary undertaking in 2002 03 having previously been an associated undertaking.
Goodwill attributable to UniEuro of 421.0 million has been calculated in accordance with FRS 2, which represents a departure from the Companies Act 1985 the Act for the purposes of showing a true and fair view, as described in note 1.4.
If the value of UniEuros goodwill had been calculated in accordance with the Act, goodwill of 429.5 million would be recorded rather than 421.0 million.
The goodwill is regarded as having an indefinite economic life owing to UniEuros market leading profitability and the expectation that this will continue in the long term.
The application by the directors of an annual impairment test supports the value of both the Elkjp and UniEuro goodwill and, as a result, no charge for impairment is required at the balance sheet date.
Because of the indefinite lives attributed to both Elkjp and UniEuro goodwill, there is no amortisation charge in the profit and loss account in respect of these acquisitions.
The adoption of indefinite lives represents a permissible departure from the Act for the purposes of showing a true and fair view.
It has not been possible to quantify the effect of this departure from the Act because no nite life for the goodwill can be identied.
