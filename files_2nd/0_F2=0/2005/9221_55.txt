40 Explanation of transition to IFRS This is the first year that the Group has presented its accounts under IFRS.
The following disclosures are required in the year of transition.
The last accounts under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 December 2004 and the date of transition to IFRSs was 1 January 2004.
Notes to the reconciliation of equity and of profit or loss extract from the 2004 accounts : IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 19 requires separate recognition of the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension schemes in the income statement and permits two different approaches for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
The Group has adopted the IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards transitional exemption and recognised the full actuarial pension deficit in equity at the date of transition.
The Group has recognised actuarial gains and losses immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The impact of this policy is to recognise an additional pension liability, net of deferred tax, of 81.3m in the Groups IFRS opening balance sheet at 1 January 2004, 71.2m at 30 June 2004 and 91.1m at 31 December 2004.
The impact of the policy on operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 is a reduction of 1.6m, with a 1.9m charge to net interest and a related tax credit of 1.1m.
For the six months to 30 June 2004, operating profit is increased by 3.4m with interest and related tax charge each increased by 0.8m.
