159711 Reed Report 55-102 7 3 06 12:04 Page 84 84 Combined financial statements Notes to the combined financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 17 Financial instruments Details of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by Reed Elsevier in relation to financial instruments are set out on pages 24 and 25 of the Operating and Financial Review.
The main financial risks faced by Reed Elsevier are liquidity risk and market risk comprising interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.
Financial instruments are used to finance the Reed Elsevier businesses and to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
Reed Elseviers businesses do not enter into speculative derivative transactions.
Details of financial instruments subject to liquidity, market and credit risks are described below.
Liquidity risk Fixed and floating rate borrowings analysed by maturity are summarised below.
Borrowings are shown after taking account of related interest rate derivatives in designated hedging relationships.

These borrowings have been included above as floating rate borrowings due after 5 years.
At 31 December 2005, Reed Elsevier had access to 1,739m a2,539m 2004: 1,555m a2,193m of committed bank facilities that expire in two to three years, of which 67m a98m 2004: 41m a58m was drawn.
These facilities principally provide back up for short term borrowings.
After taking account of the maturity of committed bank facilities that back short term borrowings at 31 December 2005, and after utilising available cash resources, no borrowings mature in the next two years 2004: nil : 46% of borrowings mature in the third year 2004: 14% : 11% in the fourth and fifth years 2004: 58% : 29% in the sixth to tenth years 2004: 16% : and 14% beyond the tenth year 2004: 12%.
159711 Reed Report 55-102 7 3 06 12:04 Page 85 Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2005 85 17 Financial instruments continued Market Risk Reed Elseviers primary market risks are to interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
Derivatives used by Reed Elsevier for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate options, forward rate agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts set out below represent the replacement costs calculated using market rates of interest and exchange at 31 December 2005.
The fair value of long term borrowings has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at market rates.
Interest rate risk Reed Elseviers interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at reducing the exposure of the combined businesses to changes in interest rates.
The following sensitivity analysis of borrowings and derivative financial instruments to interest rate movements assumes an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates for all currencies and maturities from their levels at 31 December 2005, with all other variables held constant.
The range of changes represents Reed Elseviers view of the changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period based on these assumptions.
At 31 December 2005, the majority of net borrowings are either fixed rate or have been fixed through the use of interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in net interest expense of 5m a7m, based on the composition of financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents, bank loans and commercial paper borrowings at 31 December 2005.
A 100 basis point rise in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in net interest expense of 5m a7m.
The sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments at 31 December 2005 to changes in interest rates is set out in the table below.

Long term borrowings including current portion comprise other loans and finance leases.
A 100 basis point change in interest rates would not result in a material change to the fair value of any other financial instrument.

These exposures are hedged, to a significant extent, by a policy of denominating borrowings in currencies where significant translation exposures exist, most notably US dollars see note 23.
The following sensitivity analysis of net borrowings and derivative financial instruments to foreign exchange rate movements assumes an immediate 10% change in all foreign exchange rates against sterling or euros as appropriate from their levels at 31 December 2005, with all other variables held constant.
A 10% change indicates a strengthening of the currency against sterling euro and a -10% change indicates a weakening of the currency against sterling euro.

Credit risk Reed Elsevier seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result has a credit risk from the potential non performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
Reed Elsevier also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long term credit ratings, and of the amounts outstanding with each of them.
Reed Elsevier has treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than A by Standard and Poors, Moodys or Fitch.
159711 Reed Report 55-102 7 3 06 12:04 Page 87 Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2005 87 17 Financial instruments continued Transition to IAS39 Financial Instruments Reed Elsevier adopted IAS39 Financial Instruments with effect from 1 January 2005.
On adoption of IAS39, all derivatives and fixed rate debt in hedging relationships were recorded at fair value.
Borrowings and related hedging derivatives were grossed up by 250m a352m, leaving net debt broadly unchanged.
The fair value of derivatives used to hedge forecasted transactions such as forward exchange contracts and floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps was recorded in the balance sheet and the corresponding net gain of 40m a56m deferred within the hedge reserve.
The fair value of derivatives used to swap fixed rate debt to floating rate was recognised in the balance sheet and, together with differences on restatement at spot rates of certain foreign currency working capital balances which were reported under previous GAAP at hedged rates and other working capital restatements, the corresponding net gain recorded directly in other reserves.
Including related deferred tax, other reserves were accordingly reduced by 29m a40m.
Taken together with the hedge reserve of 40m a56m, shareholders equity at 1 January 2005 was increased by a net IAS39 transition adjustment of 11m a16m.
In respect of currency risk, Reed Elsevier hedges cross border transactions in foreign currencies, the most significant of which relate to the Elsevier global scientific journals business.
Hedge accounting treatment continues to be applied to these transactions under IAS39.
However, whereas under previous GAAP hedge accounting applied to both revenues and costs where the net exchange risk is hedged in the market, under IAS39 there is no grossing up of the hedge for the foreign currency revenues and the offsetting costs and a portion of the revenues and the costs are therefore treated as if unhedged and reported at spot rates.

Interest rate derivatives including cross currency interest rate swaps with a principal amount of 954m a1,393m were in place at 31 December 2005 swapping fixed rate term debt issues denominated in United States dollars USD, euros and Swiss francs CHF to floating rate USD debt for the whole or part of their term.
The gains and losses on the borrowings and related derivatives designated as fair value hedges for the year ended 31 December 2005, which are included in the income statement, were: Fair value 1 January movement Exchange 31 December 2005 gain loss gain loss 2005 m m m m USD interest rate swaps 591 15 USD debt 5 9 1 15 Euro to USD cross currency interest rate swaps 152 62 15 105 Euro debt 151 62 15 104 1 1 CHF to USD cross currency interest rate swaps 87 41 8 54 CHF debt 86 41 8 53 1 1 Total 2 2 Fair value 1 January movement Exchange 31 December 2005 gain loss gain loss 2005 gm gm gm gm USD interest rate swaps 713 1 21 USD debt 7 13 1 21 Euro to USD cross currency interest rate swaps 214 90 30 154 Euro debt 213 90 29 152 11 2 CHF to USD cross currency interest rate swaps 123 60 16 79 CHF debt 121 60 17 78 2 1 1 Total 3 3 All fair value hedges were highly effective throughout the year ended 31 December 2005.
At 31 December 2005 there were fair value losses of 3m a4m on transition to IAS39 at 1 January 2005: 8m a11m losses included within borrowings which relate to debt fide-designated from a fair value hedge relationship.
During 2005, 5m a7m of the fair value losses recognised on transition to IAS39 was included in finance income.
159711 Reed Report 55-102 7 3 06 12:04 Page 89 Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2005 89 17 Financial instruments continued Cash flow hedges Reed Elsevier enters into two types of cash flow hedge: 1 Interest rate derivatives which fix the interest expense on a portion of forecast floating rate USD denominated debt including commercial paper, short term bank loans and floating rate term debt.
2 Foreign exchange derivatives which fix the exchange rate on a portion of future foreign currency subscription revenues forecast by the Elsevier science and medical businesses for up to 50 months.
Movements in the hedge reserve in 2005, including gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments, were as follows: Foreign Total Transition Interest rate exchange hedge loss hedges hedges reserve m m m m Hedge reserve at start of year: gains losses deferred 10 15 65 40 Gains losses arising in 2005 11 21 10 Amounts recognised in income statement 6 5 30 19 Exchange translation differences 1 1 2 4 Hedge reserve at end of year: gains losses deferred 5 12 7 Foreign Total Transition Interest rate exchange hedge loss hedges hedges reserve gm gm gm gm Hedge reserve at start of year: gains losses deferred 15 22 95 58 Gains losses arising in 2005 16 31 15 Amounts recognised in income statement 9 7 44 28 Exchange translation differences 1 1 3 5 Hedge reserve at end of year: gains losses deferred 7 17 10 All cash flow hedges were highly effective throughout the year ended 31 December 2005.
The transition loss relates to interest rate derivatives held on 1 January 2005, which were formerly treated as hedging instruments under UK GAAP but which are not designated as such under IAS39.
The deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges at 31 December 2005 are currently expected to be recognised in the income statement in future years as follows: Foreign Total Transition Interest rate exchange hedge loss hedges hedges reserve m m m m 2006 3 12 9 2007 2 1 2 1 2008 2 2 2009 1 1 Gains losses deferred in hedge reserve at end of year 5 12 7
