25 Financial instruments Details of managements policies for controlling the risks associated with financial instruments, including policies on matters such as hedging of risk exposures and avoiding undue concentrations of credit risk are given in the section on Financial Risk Management on pages 51 and 52.
Derivative financial instruments The group adopted IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 January 2004.
However, the group only achieved hedge accounting from 1 January 2005 when the hedge documentation requirements of IAS 39 were in place.
Interest rate risk At 31 December 2005, the group held interest rate swaps covering unsecured oating rate bank borrowings of 412 million, effectively xing the associated cost of interest at rates between 4.01% and 6.43%.
In addition, the group held caps and collars covering a further 70 million in total, tranches of which are allowed to oat at rates between oors of 4.25% and 5.00% and caps of between 4.75% and 6.25%.
The groups caps and collars are not designated as hedging instruments, however all of the groups interest rate swaps, were designated as cash ow hedges from 1 January 2005.
The gains and losses deferred in equity will be recorded in the income statement during the next 10 years being the lives of the instruments.
In anticipation of raising additional funds around the year end, the group entered into a pre-hedge arrangement during the first half of 2005.
This enabled the group to lock into the interest rates on offer at that time, avoiding the risks of rate movements up to the date the funding would be agreed.
Funding, by way of a US Private Placing, was subsequently negotiated in December 2005 with the funds being made available on 1 February 2006.
To the extent that it is effective, the value of the pre-hedge can be deferred in the balance sheet and recorded in the income statement over the life of the funding.
Foreign currency risk All foreign currency denominated borrowings are immediately swapped into Sterling at the commencement of the facility agreement and, hence, the group is not exposed to currency rate uctuations.
The groups cross-currency swaps were designated as fair value hedges to hedge against interest and foreign currency risk from 1 January 2005.
As a consequence, the change in the fair values of these swaps are recorded in the income statement within finance costs, together with the change in the fair value of the US Dollar denominated Private Placing which the swaps have hedged.
