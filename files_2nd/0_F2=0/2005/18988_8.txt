Directors responsibility statement Directors responsibilities for the financial statements The Directors prepare financial statements for each financial year, which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors accept responsibility for: selecting suitable accounting policies and then applying them consistently: making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: stating whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: and preparing the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards and the Guernsey Companies Law 1994.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Companys website.
Legislation in Guernsey governing the preparation and the dissemination of financial statements may differ from other jurisdictions.
