With effect from 1 April 2005, in accordance with European law, we will be preparing financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
In order to explain how the Groups reported performance and financial position are affected by this change, the following unaudited financial information is provided below: Consolidated balance sheets under IFRS as at 1 April 2004, 30 September 2004 and 31 March 2005: Consolidated income statements under IFRS for the six months to 30 September 2004 and year to 31 March 2005: Consolidated statements of recognised income and expense under IFRS for the six months to 30 September 2004 and year to 31 March 2005: Consolidated statements of changes in equity under IFRS for the six months to 30 September 2004 and 31 March 2005: Consolidated statements of cash flows under IFRS for the six months to 30 September 2004 and year to 31 March 2005: Proforma changes in reported Group net borrowings at 1 April 2005 under IFRS: Reconciliation of consolidated balance sheet under IFRS to UK GAAP as at 1 April 2004, 30 September 2004 and 31 March 2005: Reconciliation of consolidated income statement under IFRS to UK GAAP for the six months to 30 September 2004 and 31 March 2005 It should be noted that, although this financial information has been prepared on the basis of IFRS expected to be in place for use by EU-listed companies as at 31 March 2006, these standards are subject to ongoing review and endorsement by the European Commission and are, therefore, still subject to potential change.
Information contained within this appendix may require further updating for audit adjustments or subsequent amendments to IFRS, and related guidance.
The IFRS information contained in this appendix is unaudited.
Basis of preparation The financial information contained in this appendix has been prepared based on IFRS published by 31 March 2005.
It has been assumed that the European Commission will subsequently endorse the amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures.
Transitional arrangements and transition date The rules for first-time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
Since the financial statements for the year to 31 March 2006 include comparatives for the year to 31 March 2005, the Groups date of transition to IFRS will be 1 April 2004.
As required by IFRS 1, estimates carried forward at the transition date, including but not limited to assessments of provisions and contingent liabilities and, where applicable, adjusted to comply with IFRS are consistent with estimates made prior to transition.
In accordance with IFRS 1, the Group must define accounting policies compliant with IFRS at its first reporting date and apply these policies retrospectively to each period presented.
IFRS 1 allows a number of optional exemptions and also contains certain mandatory exceptions to this principle in order to ease the transition requirements of first-time adoption.
The Group has applied the following exemptions available under IFRS 1: The Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations prospectively with effect from the transition date.
The effect of this decision is detailed in paragraph d below.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment are carried under UK GAAP at amounts based upon valuations.
The Group has applied the exemption which permits a first-time adopter to use a previous GAAP revaluation of an item of property, plant and equipment as deemed cost.
Consequently, there is no adjustment to the previous carrying value under UK GAAP.
As permitted by IFRS 1 the Group has recognised all cumulative actuarial gains and losses at the transition date for all employee benefit plans falling within the scope of IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
This means that the net deficit on the Groups employee benefit plans will be included within net assets at 1 April 2004.
The Group has applied the IFRS 1 exemption from the requirement for retrospective application of IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates in respect of cumulative translation differences.
This means that the Group has elected not to classify any retained earnings arising prior to 1 April 2004 within cumulative translation differences, which are, therefore, deemed to be zero at the transition date.
The Group has applied the IFRS 1 exemption from the requirement to restate its comparative information for the effects of adopting IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts.
The Group will not restate comparative information at 1 April 2004 or for the year to 31 March 2005 for these standards.
As permitted under IFRS 1 and IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, the Group has made no adjustment in either the income statement or balance sheet for share option grants that occurred prior to 7 November 2002.
104 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2005 Key changes in accounting policies The following notes highlight the main differences between UK GAAP and IFRS that have a material effect on the financial statements of the Group.
a Share-based payment Under UK GAAP, the Group recognised a charge in respect of employee share options based on the difference between the exercise price of the option and the market value of a Tate & Lyle share at the grant date.
Accordingly, only grants made under the Tate & Lyle 2003 Performance Share Plan attracted a charge under UK GAAP, based on their intrinsic value.
IFRS 2 requires the Group to recognise a charge reflecting the fair value of all employee share options granted since 7 November 2002 that had not vested by the date of transition of 1 April 2004.
The UK GAAP charge for the year to 31 March 2005 totalled 2 million, reflecting expense for two years of option grants.
The impact of IFRS on profit before taxation for the year to 31 March 2005 is an additional charge of 2 million six months to 30 September 2004 additional charge of 1 million.
In the year to 31 March 2006, the IFRS charge will increase to reflect expense covering three years of option grants.
Net assets increased by 3 million at 31 March 2005 30 September 2004 1 million: 1 April 2004 nil million reflecting the deferred taxation impact.
b Employee benefits Tate & Lyle operates a number of pension and post-retirement healthcare schemes and has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for these schemes in accordance with SSAP 24, which requires that the expected cost be charged to the profit and loss account so as to accrue cost over the service lives of employees on the basis of a constant percentage of earnings.
Under IAS 19, the net surplus or deficit for each defined benefit scheme is calculated based on the present value of the discounted obligation less the fair value of the plan assets.
The Group has elected to adopt early the amendment to IAS 19 issued by the IASB on 16 December 2004, which allows all actuarial gains and losses to be immediately charged or credited to equity through the statement of recognised income and expense.
The charge to the income statement under IAS 19 comprises the current service cost, interest cost on scheme liabilities, expected return on scheme assets, past service cost and the impact of any settlements or curtailments.
The impact on profit before taxation for the year to 31 March 2005 is a credit of 4 million six months to 30 September 2004 2 million.
Net assets at 31 March 2005 reduced by 117 million 30 September 2004 105 million: 1 April 2004 99 million.
The impact on net assets reflects the reversal of prepayments and liabilities previously reported under UK GAAP and recognition of assets and liabilities measured in accordance with IFRS, including those of joint ventures, adjusted for the impact of deferred taxation.
c Intangible assets Research and development Under UK GAAP, the Group expensed all research and development costs as incurred.
Under IFRS, the Group is required to capitalise development costs where this expenditure meets the recognition criteria set out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Research costs continue to be expensed as incurred.
The capitalisation under IFRS of development costs expensed during the 2005 financial year under UK GAAP increased profit before taxation under IFRS by 1 million in the year to 31 March 2005 six months to 30 September 2004 1 million.
The charge in the year to 31 March 2005 under IFRS for the amortisation of development costs capitalised in previous periods reduces profit before taxation by 1 million compared to UK GAAP six months to 30 September 2004 1 million.
Overall, the impact on profit before tax in the year to 31 March 2005 is nil million six months to 30 September 2004 nil million.
The impact on net assets under IFRS, reflecting the capitalisation of costs previously expensed as incurred under UK GAAP, after adjusting for the impact of deferred taxation, is an increase of 5 million at 31 March 2005 30 September 2004 5 million: 1 April 2004 5 million.
Reclassification of capitalised software costs Under UK GAAP, software assets were included as part of property, plant and equipment, whereas under IFRS, unless they are integral to another fixed asset, they are included as part of intangible assets.
In the balance sheet, a reclassification of 4 million from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets was reflected under IFRS at 31 March 2005 30 September 2004 4 million: 1 April 2004 4 million.
There was no impact on either profit before taxation or total net assets under IFRS.
The treatment of goodwill under IFRS is discussed in the following note.
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2005 105 Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued d Business combinations IFRS 3 Business Combinations introduces significant changes to the accounting for acquisitions compared to UK GAAP.
The international standard requires recognition of all intangible assets that meet the IAS 38 recognition criteria.
Any goodwill arising from business combinations is not amortised under IAS 38, but is subject to impairment tests annually or whenever there is an indication of impairment.
Negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The requirement to cease amortising goodwill has the impact of increasing profit before taxation by 9 million in the year to 31 March 2005 six months to 30 September 2004 5 million.
Net assets at 31 March 2005 increased by 9 million 30 September 2004 5 million: 1 April 2004 nil million.
IFRS 3 requires the Group to record inventories acquired in a business combination at an amount equivalent to the selling price of those inventories, less costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the subsequent selling effort of the Group.
UK GAAP requires acquired inventories to be recorded at cost.
In the case of the sucralose realignment, this leads to the Groups acquired inventory being valued at an amount 4 million higher under IFRS than under UK GAAP, resulting in an increased charge under IFRS during both the year to 31 March 2005 and the six months to 30 September 2004 of 4 million.
Net assets at 31 March 2005 reduced by 4 million 30 September 2004 4 million: 1 April 2004 not applicable.
e Accounting for joint ventures Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for joint ventures using the gross equity method, showing its share of joint venture turnover as part of total turnover, and its share of operating profit separately on the face of the profit and loss account.
Under IFRS, the Group has elected to account for joint ventures using proportionate consolidation, whereby its share of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses is combined line by line with similar items in the Groups financial statements.
While this change does not alter total net assets, it has a significant impact on the classification of assets and liabilities within the Groups balance sheet.
Profit before taxation remains unchanged for all periods presented.
f Taxation There is no difference in accounting for current taxation between UK GAAP and IFRS.
In respect of deferred taxation, under UK GAAP, the Group recognised deferred taxation only on timing differences that arose from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they were recognised in the financial statements.
Under IAS 12 Income Taxes, deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Under UK GAAP, the Group elected to discount deferred tax as permitted by FRS 19.
Discounting of deferred tax is not permitted under IFRS.
The impact on the taxation charge for the year to 31 March 2005 is a credit of 2 million six months to 30 September 2004 1 million reflecting the reversal of the discounting effect recognised under UK GAAP.
Net assets at 31 March 2005 reduced by 29 million 30 September 2004 31 million: 1 April 2004 30 million, due to the reversal of the discounting effect recognised under UK GAAP as well as the recognition of deferred taxation in respect of the unremitted earnings of certain overseas investments.
g Other Events after the balance sheet date Under UK GAAP, the Group recognised a provision for the dividend declared within its financial statements.
IFRS specifically states that dividends approved by the relevant authority after the reporting date do not meet the definition of a present obligation and should not therefore be recognised.
The impact of this is to increase net assets at 31 March 2005 by 65 million 30 September 2004 27 million: 1 April 2004 62 million.
Other Other adjustments, relating to sundry reclassifications and remeasurements, increase net assets by 6 million at 31 March 2005 30 September 2004 5 million: 1 April 2004 5 million.
106 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2005 Financial instruments There is currently no standard that comprehensively addresses accounting for financial instruments under UK GAAP.
As noted above, the Group has applied the IFRS 1 exemption from the requirement to restate its comparative information for the effects of adopting IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts.
Therefore, the Group will adopt these standards with effect from 1 April 2005.
The Group distinguishes between financial instruments held for trading purposes and those held for hedging purposes.
Under UK GAAP, trading instruments were marked to market using externally derived market prices.
Gains or losses were recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
The Group will continue to account for financial instruments held for trading under IFRS on the same basis.
For hedging instruments, the Group applied a form of hedge accounting which enabled changes in the market value of financial instruments to be matched in the profit and loss account with recognition of the underlying hedged exposure.
Under IFRS, the Group will recognise all derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet at inception at fair value.
IAS 39 places significant restrictions on the use of hedge accounting as specific designation and effectiveness criteria must be satisfied.
The use of fair values in measuring derivative financial instruments may lead to greater volatility in the Groups balance sheet.
Since the Group may not achieve hedge accounting for all instruments used for hedging purposes, the income statement may become more volatile under IFRS.
Our European Food & Industrial Ingredients business operates a securitisation programme under which it receives cash from selling amounts receivable from customers.
The facility of US$85 million 45 million was fully utilised at 31 March 2005.
Under UK GAAP, the amounts received under this facility are linked in presentation to the original amounts receivable.
Under IAS 39, the amounts received will be included in borrowings.
Proforma changes in Group net borrowings The adoption of IFRS does not have any material impact on the underlying cash flows of the Group.
However, the adoption is expected to lead to a number of recognition and classification differences that are likely to impact the Groups reported net borrowings.
The following table summarises the anticipated effect of these differences.
Proforma net debt at 1 April 2005 under IFRS million Net debt at 31 March 2005 under UK GAAP 451 Net debt of joint ventures recognised under proportionate consolidation 20 Net debt at 31 March 2005 under IFRS 471 Adjustments upon adoption of IAS 39: Reclassification of receivables securitisation 45 Net debt at 1 April 2005 under IFRS 516 Note: The fair value component of derivative financial instruments used to modify the currency profile of the Groups borrowings will continue to be classified within net debt.

Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2005 111 Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued Summary of Group Accounting Policies The financial information in this Appendix has been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies set out below.
It has been assumed that the European Commission will subsequently endorse IFRS 2 Share based payment, and the amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures.
The financial information has, as permitted by the exemption in IFRS 1, not been prepared in accordance with IAS 32 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation, IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement, and IFRS 4 Insurance contracts.
Basis of consolidation a Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights and taking into account the existence of potential voting rights.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The recognised identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All inter-company transactions and balances between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
b Joint ventures An entity is regarded as a joint venture if the Group has joint control over its operating and financial policies.
The Groups interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for by proportionate consolidation, whereby the Groups share of the joint ventures income and expenses, assets and liabilities and cash flows are combined on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the Groups financial statements.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of joint ventures to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Company.
The Group recognises the portion of gains or losses on the sale of assets to the joint venture that is attributable to the other venturers.
The Group does not recognise its share of profits or losses from the joint venture that result from the Groups purchase of assets from the joint venture until it resells the assets to an external entity.
c Associates An entity is regarded as an associate if the Group has significant influence, but not control, over its operating and financial policies.
Significant influence generally exists where the Group holds more than 20% and less than 50% of the shareholders voting rights.
Associates are accounted for under the equity method whereby the Groups profit and loss account includes its share of their profits and losses and the Groups balance sheet includes its share of their net assets.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of associates to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Company.
When the Groups share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
112 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2005 Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
b Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
c Group entities From 1 April 2004, the results and financial position of all the Groups entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: i assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments for each balance sheet presented, are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: ii income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates as a reasonable approximation to the rates prevailing on the transaction dates: and iii all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
Prior to 1 April 2004, exchange differences were recognised in retained earnings.
On consolidation exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences that have accumulated since 1 April 2004 are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings comprise mainly manufacturing sites and administrative facilities.
Certain items of land and buildings are carried at amounts based upon valuations recognised in accordance with UK GAAP prior to the Groups adoption of IFRS.
All other property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation and impairment.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All repairs and maintenance expenditures are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost or revalued amount of each asset to its residual value over its useful economic life as follows: Freehold land: No depreciation Freehold buildings: 20 to 50 years Leasehold property: Period of the lease Bulk liquid storage tanks: 12 to 20 years Plant and machinery: 3 to 28 years The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted if appropriate.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater that its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in the income statement.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2005 113 Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued Summary of Group Accounting Policies continued Leased assets Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding leasing commitments, net of finance charges, are included in liabilities.
Leasing payments are analysed between capital and interest components so that the interest element is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease at a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability outstanding.
Depreciation on assets held under finance leases is charged to the income statement.
All other leases are treated as operating leases with annual rentals charged to the income statement, net of any incentives granted to the lessee, over the term of the lease.
Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the consideration exchanged, including directly attributable acquisition costs, and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and is capitalised.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Where the acquired interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Gains and losses on the disposal of a business component include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
b Development costs Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Costs incurred on development projects relating to the design and testing of new or improved products are recognised as intangible assets when the IAS 38 recognition criteria are met.
Other development expenditures are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Capitalised development costs are amortised from the commencement of the commercial production of the product on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected benefit.
c Patents and other intellectual property Patents and other intellectual property are shown at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Where the assets are acquired as part of a business combination, historical cost is based on their fair values as at the date of the combination.
Amortisation of the assets is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected benefit.
Impairments Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows.
Financial instruments As previously noted, the Group will adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39 for the year ending 31 March 2006 onwards.
The accompanying financial information has therefore been prepared using the Groups current UK GAAP accounting policies, which are summarised below.
An explanation of how the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 will affect the accounting for financial instruments is presented on page 118. a Commodity trading instruments Open financial and physical trading positions are marked to market using externally derived market prices.
Movements in fair value are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account, with corresponding debtors or creditors included within the balance sheet.
b Commodity hedging instruments Commodity hedging instruments are matched to the risks that they are designed to hedge, with gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account in the same period as the income and costs of the underlying hedged transactions.
114 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2005 c Treasury hedging instruments Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Changes in the instruments fair value are not recognised.
Cross-currency swap instruments are matched with their underlying hedged item.
These instruments are translated at period-end exchange rates: gains and losses arising are included in the measurement of the related liabilities and dealt with in the Group profit and loss account.
Where foreign currency borrowings are used to finance foreign equity investments, differences arising from the movement in exchange rates during the year from translation to sterling of the foreign currency borrowings and similar instruments used to finance long-term foreign equity investments are taken directly to distributable reserves and reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts which are hedging anticipated exposures are deferred until the date the underlying transaction being hedged is recorded in the Group balance sheet.
Forward foreign exchange contracts which are hedging existing transactions are revalued to period-end spot rates together with the existing transactions, and the resulting gains and losses are recognised in the Group profit and loss account immediately.
All premiums or fees, paid or received, in respect of financial instruments are accounted for over the life of the matched underlying asset, liability, income or cost.
Where the matched underlying asset, liability, income or cost ceases to exist, or is no longer considered likely to exist in the future, the hedging instrument is sold.
Any profit or loss on the sale is recognised in the profit and loss account as part of operating profit.
Inventories Except for those items noted below, inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the first in first out or weighted average cost methods, appropriate to the materials and production processes involved.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs to completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Certain items of merchandisable agricultural commodities are stated at market value, in line with regional industry accounting practices.
Trade receivables, loans and other amounts receivable Trade receivables, loans and other amounts receivable are stated at the fair value of the amounts due, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital and holds that share either directly as treasury shares or indirectly within an ESOP trust, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Borrowings Borrowings are stated at the amount of net proceeds received after deduction of issue costs.
Issue costs and any discount to face value arising on issue, or any premium payable on maturity, are amortised evenly in the profit and loss account over the term of the debt.
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2005 115 Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued Summary of Group Accounting Policies continued Provisions Provisions for liabilities and charges are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably measured.
If the effect is material, provisions are measured using expected future cash flows discounted at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
Income taxes The charge for current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-taxable or disallowed.
It is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Employee benefits a Pension obligations Group companies operate various pension schemes.
The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations.
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
The Group has elected to apply the 2004 amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits with effect from 1 April 2004: actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity immediately.
116 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2005 Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
b Other post-employment obligations Some Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to their retirees.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period.
The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using an accounting methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension plans.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, and changes in actuarial assumptions, are charged or credited to income over the expected average remaining working lives of the related employees.
These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.
c Share-based compensation The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
For all grants made from 7 November 2002 onwards, the fair value of employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, profitability and sales growth targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, for options granted with non-market vesting conditions, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and share premium when the options are exercised.
Revenue recognition a Sales of goods and services Sales comprise the amount receivable in the ordinary course of business, net of value added and sales taxes, for goods and services provided.
Sales are recognised at the point or points at which the Group has performed its obligations in connection with the contractual terms of the sales agreement, and in exchange obtains the right to consideration.
b Interest income Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
c Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Dividend distribution A dividend distribution to the Companys equity holders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders or in the case of interim dividends, by the Board of Directors.
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2005 117 Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued Adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 As previously noted, the Group has deferred the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 until 1 April 2005.
Consequently, the Groups previous, UK GAAP accounting policies concerning financial instruments have been applied in the financial information for the year ended 31 March 2005 presented in this Appendix.
The Groups accounting policy under IFRS and the anticipated impacts of adoption on its financial statements are summarised below.
a Commodity trading instruments Movements in fair value will continue to be recognised immediately in the profit and loss account: corresponding amounts in current assets and liabilities will be classified as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
b Commodity and treasury hedging instruments Under IAS 39, hedging relationships are categorised by type and must meet strict criteria to qualify for hedge accounting.
Cash flow hedges Hedges of highly probable forecast transactions are designated as cash flow hedges.
To the extent that movements in the fair values of these instruments effectively offset the underlying risk being hedged they are recognised in the hedging reserve in equity until the period during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss, at which point the cumulative gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss, offsetting the value of the hedged transaction.
Movements in the fair value of hedging instruments where the instrument failed to meet the IAS 39 hedge accounting criteria or where the movement represents the ineffective portion of a qualifying hedging relationship are recognised in profit or loss immediately, under the heading net finance cost.
Previously, movements in the fair values of hedging instruments that were deemed by the Group to represent economic hedges were held off-balance sheet until the hedged transactions occurred, at which point the cumulative gain or loss was offset against the hedged transaction.
The strict nature of the IAS 39 hedge accounting criteria is likely to lead to greater volatility in the reported results of the Group, as movements in the fair values of non-qualifying or ineffective hedging instruments are required to be recognised in different periods to those in which the hedged transactions affect profit or loss.
Fair value hedges Hedges against the movement in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities are designated as fair value hedges.
To the extent that movements in the fair values of these instruments effectively offset the underlying risk being hedged they are recognised in the income statement by offset against the hedged transaction.
Previously, movements in the fair values of hedging instruments that were deemed by the Group to represent economic hedges were recognised by offset against the hedged transaction.
Hedges of net investments Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, including hedges of a monetary item that is accounted for as part of the net investment, are designated as hedges of net investments.
To the extent that movements in the fair values of these instruments effectively offset the underlying risk being hedged they are recognised in the hedging reserve until the period during which a foreign operation is disposed of or partially disposed of, at which point the cumulative gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss, offsetting the cumulative difference recognised on the translation of the net investment.
Movements in the fair value of hedging instruments where the movement represents the ineffective portion of a qualifying hedging relationship are recognised in profit or loss immediately, under the heading net finance cost.
Corresponding amounts are presented as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
Previously, movements in the fair values of hedging instruments that were deemed by the Group to represent economic net investment hedges were taken directly to equity and reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
c Embedded derivatives Where an embedded derivative is not closely related to the host contract, movements in the fair value of the embedded derivative are separated from the associated transaction and recognised in profit or loss, under the heading net finance cost.
d Non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities Non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are classified as loans and receivables and debt instruments respectively.
They will continue to be recognised at fair value and measured subsequently at amortised cost.
