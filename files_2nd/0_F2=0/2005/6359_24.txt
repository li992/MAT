b Accounting policies The parent company balance sheet is prepared in accordance with UK GAAP which is progressively converging towards IFRS.
The following Financial Reporting Standards which became applicable for the first time in 2005 are identical in all essential respects to their IFRS equivalents: FRS 20 Sharebased Payment, FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date, FRS 22 Earnings per share, FRS 23 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, FRS 24 Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies, FRS 25 Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation and FRS 26 Financial instruments: measurement which only incorporates the measurement aspects of IAS 39.
Also applicable for the first time in 2005 is FRS 17 Retirement benefits, the requirements of which are, in respect of pension obligations, similar to those contained within IAS 19 Employee Benefits which have been adopted by the group.

The balance sheet at 31 December 2004 has been restated in respect of the retrospective implementation of the new accounting standards, other than in respect of FRS 25 and FRS 26.
