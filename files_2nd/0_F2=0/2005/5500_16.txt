UK GAAP differs in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted under IFRS.
The Group will adopt IFRS as its primary accounting basis, applicable for the first time in the Groups Annual Report for the 52 weeks ending 30 September 2006 FY06.
Consequently, the Groups interim financial statements for the 26 weeks ending 1 April 2006 and the full year results for the 52 weeks ending 30 September 2006 will be prepared in accordance with IFRS, with restated comparatives for FY05.
The date of the Groups initial transition to IFRS is 3 October 2004, being the start of FY05.
The Group is required to establish its IFRS accounting policies as at 30 September 2006 and, in general, apply these retrospectively to determine the IFRS opening balance sheet at the date of transition on 3 October 2004.
The financial information presented in this footnote has been prepared on the basis of all IFRSs, including International Accounting Standards IAS and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and its committees and as interpreted by any regulatory bodies applicable to the Group.
These are subject to ongoing amendment by the IASB and subsequent endorsement by the European Commission and are therefore subject to possible change.
As a result, the following information will require updating for any subsequent amendment to IFRS which impacts on first time adoption or any new standards that the Group may elect to adopt early.
The significant unaudited adjustments between UK GAAP and IFRS that are expected to affect retained profit loss and equity shareholders funds are discussed below.
Additionally, the expected GAAP adjustments are shown in the tables that follow.
This footnote does not include disclosures required by IFRS.
76 Enodis plc Unaudited other information iii International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued Goodwill amortisation and impairment Under UK GAAP, the policy followed prior to the adoption of FRS10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets FRS10 which was effective for accounting periods ended on or after 23 December 1998 and was adopted on a prospective basis was to write off goodwill against equity reserves in the year of acquisition.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a previously acquired business, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging the amount of related goodwill previously charged to equity reserves.
FRS10 requires goodwill to be capitalised and amortised over its estimated useful economic life.
Under UK GAAP, the Group has adopted a 20 year estimated useful life with respect to goodwill amortisation.
Under IFRS, in accordance with available transitional exemptions, goodwill arising on previously acquired businesses subsequent to 23 December 1998 has been capitalised.
In the case of acquisitions that arose up to or before 23 December 1998, goodwill was written off directly to equity reserves.
Prior to the Groups transition to IFRS on 3 October 2004, goodwill previously written off to equity reserves was charged to the income statement when the related business was sold.
Following the Groups transition to IFRS, goodwill remaining in equity reserves will no longer be charged to the income statement, but will be retained within the Groups retained earnings when the related business is sold.
Additionally, goodwill capitalised on the Groups IFRS balance sheet is now deemed to have an indefinite useful life and will not be subject to an annual amortisation charge.
Instead, capitalised goodwill balances are now reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Pensions and other post employment benefits In the Groups consolidated UK GAAP financial statements, pension and other post employment benefit obligations are accounted for in accordance with SSAP24 Accounting for Pension Costs SSAP24.
Additional disclosures have also been made under the transitional arrangements for the adoption of FRS17, Retirement Benefits.
Under SSAP24, pension and other post employment benefit costs are charged to the income statement based on a Projected Unit Funding or Attained Age basis, so as to spread pension and other post employment benefit costs, as well as any related plan surpluses or deficits, at a substantially level percentage of payroll costs over the participating employees estimated service lives.
Under IFRS, the Group accounts for pension and other post retirement benefit obligations in accordance with IAS19 Employee Benefits as amended IAS19, which is similar to FRS17 in many respects, particularly in that it requires the net deficit of the Groups defined benefit and other post employment benefit obligations to be brought onto the Groups balance sheet.
Under IAS19, the costs of providing pensions and other post employment benefits are calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method and are spread over the participating employees estimated service lives.
The Groups IFRS pension and other post employment benefit obligations are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at rates reflecting the yields of high quality corporate bonds.
Plan assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Under IFRS, actuarial gains and losses, differences between the expected and actual returns, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expenses in the period that they arise.
Accordingly, differences relating to the accounting for pension and other post employment benefit obligations between UK GAAP and IFRS arise from the requirement to use different methods and assumptions for valuing plan assets and a different method of charging plan surpluses or deficits.
Under both UK GAAP and IFRS, contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
Share options The Group has a number of share-based incentive option arrangements.
Under UK GAAP, where options are granted at the market price on the date of grant, an accounting entry arises when share options are exercised.
This entry results in equity shareholders funds increasing by the product of the number of options exercised multiplied by the original option price.
Under IFRS, all grants of share options subsequent to 7 November 2002 are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
Fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model, incorporating an adjustment for related market based performance conditions.
The fair value is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the options vesting period.
77 Enodis plc Unaudited other information iii International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued Deferred taxation The basis for recognising deferred tax items is different under UK GAAP and IFRS.
Under UK GAAP, deferred taxation is provided on timing differences between the accounting and taxable profit an income statement approach.
Under IFRS, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on all temporary differences between book carrying values and the respective tax base of assets and liabilities a balance sheet approach.
This difference in approach to determining taxable differences has not given rise to a significant GAAP adjustment for the Group.
The main adjustments relating to deferred taxation have arisen due to the tax effect of other IFRS adjustments made.
Gain loss on sale of businesses As discussed above, goodwill previously written off to equity reserves prior to the adoption of FRS10 is included in determining the gain or loss on sale of a business under UK GAAP.
Following the Groups transition to IFRS, goodwill remaining in equity reserves is not charged to profit loss on disposal.
Proposed dividends Under UK GAAP, proposed dividends are recognised as a liability in the period to which they relate.
Under IFRS, dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved.
Exemptions applied under IFRS1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS1 The standard provides a number of exemptions that are available on the transition to IFRS and the Group has applied the following exemptions: Business combinations that occurred before 3 October 2004 The Group has elected not to apply IFRS3 Business Combinations retrospectively to acquisitions arising before 3 October 2004.
As a result, net goodwill arising from past business combinations of 182.3m remains as stated under UK GAAP on 3 October 2004, save for foreign exchange rate movements: Pensions and other post employment benefits actuarial gains and losses The Group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in relation to pension and other post employment benefits at the date of transition to IFRS: Share options The Group has elected not to apply IFRS2 Share-based Payment retrospectively to all share options granted prior to 7 November 2002: Financial Instruments Under the transitional exemptions, the Group has elected to adopt IAS32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement with effect from 2 October 2005.
Accordingly, the Group is not required to restate the UK GAAP FY05 results for IAS32 and IAS39: and Cumulative foreign currency translation differences Under the transitional exemptions, the Group has elected to deem the cumulative differences on the retranslation into Sterling of the Groups net investment in foreign operations to be nil as at 3 October 2004.
As a result, in the event of the subsequent disposal of a foreign operation, any gain or loss on disposal will only include cumulative translation differences arising on or after 3 October 2004.
