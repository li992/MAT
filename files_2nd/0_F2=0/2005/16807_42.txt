Details of the Companys deferred tax asset are included in note 15.
Other provisions Other provisions primarily comprise amounts provided for legal claims, decommissioning costs and restructuring costs.
The associated cash outows for restructuring costs are substantially short term in nature.
For decommissioning costs, the associated cash outows are generally expected to occur at the dates of exit of the assets to which they relate, which are long term in nature.
The timing of cash outows associated with legal claims cannot be reasonably determined.
