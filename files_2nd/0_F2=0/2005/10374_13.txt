The amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the reporting period and reduced by payments made in respect of the debt in that period.
Amounts payable and receivable in respect of derivative financial instruments that hedge the interest rate exposures attached to the debt are accounted for on an accruals basis and treated as part of the finance cost.
Share-based compensation The cost of share awards, being the difference between the market value of the shares on the date of grant of the award and the amount of consideration the participants may be required to pay for the shares, is charged to the profit and loss account over the performance period attached to the award.

The credit entry for the charge to the profit and loss account is reported in the reconciliation of movement in shareholders funds.
The cost of own shares held in treasury treasury shares or by the Companys employee share trusts for the purpose of fullling obligations in respect of the Groups employee share plans are deducted from shareholders funds in the Group and Company balance sheets.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those which fall within the ordinary activities of the Group and which need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence.
Such items are included within operating profit, or interest payable, unless they represent profits or losses on the sale or termination of an operation, costs of a fundamental reorganisation or restructuring separation costs or profits or losses on the disposal of fixed assets, other than marginal adjustments to depreciation previously charged.
In these cases, disclosure is made on the face of the profit and loss account Page 35 Mitchells & Butlers Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 Notes to the financial statements continued 3.
Change in accounting policy The Group has adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benets in full with effect from 26 September 2004.
In prior years, the Group has complied with the transitional disclosure requirements of this standard.
FRS 17 has been adopted in full in light of the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards from 1 January 2005: the measurement principles in the equivalent international accounting standard are similar to those in FRS 17.
The change in accounting policy therefore provides investors with greater clarity of earnings and net assets going forward.
The full adoption of FRS 17 has resulted in a change in the accounting treatment of the Groups dened benefit arrangements.
In particular, the net liabilities of the pension schemes are included on the balance sheet, current service costs and net financial returns are included in the profit and loss account and actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised group gains and losses.
Further information on FRS 17 is provided in notes 1 and 8.
Previous accounting under SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs required the charging of regular costs and variations from regular cost in the profit and loss account with the difference between the cumulative amounts charged and the payments made to the pension schemes shown as either a prepayment or creditor on the balance sheet.
This change in accounting policy has been accounted for as a prior year adjustment and previously reported gures have been restated accordingly, as follows: Group profit and loss account profit before interest Interest Tax Earnings 52 weeks to 25 September 2004 m m m m As previously reported 285 103 57 125 Adoption of FRS 17 12 1 4 7 As restated 273 102 53 118 The restated earnings have resulted in restated eps numbers: basic, diluted and adjusted eps have been restated from 22.4p, 22.2p and 22.2p to 21.1p, 21.0p and 20.9p respectively.

Pensions Retirement and death benets are provided for eligible employees in the United Kingdom principally by the Mitchells & Butlers Pension Plan MABPP and the Mitchells & Butlers Executive Pension Plan MABEPP.
The dened benefit sections of the plans closed to new entrants during 2002 with new members provided with dened contribution arrangements.
The assets of the plans are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Companys assets.
In the 53 weeks ended 1 October 2005, the Group paid regular contributions to the pension plans of 12m in respect of the dened benefit arrangements and additional contributions of 30m.
In 2004, the regular contributions were 4m 5m in relation to 2004 was prepaid in 2003 and additional contributions were 40m.
Employer contribution rates to the dened benefit arrangements for 2005 06 are 16.5% for the MABPP and 34.0% for the MABEPP.
It has also been agreed that further additional contributions of 30m will be paid over the next two years, of which 10m relates to the agreement reached at the time of the securitisation.
20m of these additional contributions were paid on 21 October 2005.
The Group also paid 1m 2004 1m in respect of the dened contribution arrangements.
Page 38 Mitchells & Butlers Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 8.
Pensions continued The Group has adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benets in full for the 53 weeks ended 1 October 2005 and prior year amounts have been restated accordingly.
See note 3 for further details.
In previous years, the Group accounted for pensions under SSAP 24 and gave disclosures under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries.
The Groups total pension cost included within operating profit for the 53 weeks ended 1 October 2005 under FRS 17 was 14m 2004 15m, comprising 13m 2004 14m in respect of the dened benefit pension arrangements and 1m 2004 1m in respect of the dened contribution arrangements.
The total pension cost for the 53 weeks ended 1 October 2005 included within operating profit compares to 45m 2004 3m which would have been incurred under SSAP 24.
The SSAP 24 cost would have been higher this year reecting the impact of the full actuarial valuations of the pension schemes at 31 March 2004.
If FRS 17 had not been adopted, the net assets of the Group would have been 200m higher at 1 October 2005 under SSAP 24.
The valuations used for FRS 17 purposes are based on the results of the full actuarial valuations carried out at 31 March 2004 updated by the independent qualied actuaries to 1 October 2005.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 1 October 2005 and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method.
As the dened benefit sections of the pension plans are now closed to new members, the current service cost as calculated under the projected unit method will increase as members approach retirement.
The principal financial assumptions used by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were: 2005 2004 2003 Wages and salaries increases 4.3% 4.3% 4.2% Pensions increases 2.8% 2.8% 2.7% Discount rate 5.0% 5.5% 5.3% Ination rate 2.8% 2.8% 2.7% The combined assets of the MABPP and MABEPP, their expected rates of return and the value of the pension scheme assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date can be summarised as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Long-term Long-term Long-term rates rates rates of return of return of return expected Value expected Value expected Value %m %m % m Equities 7.5 564 8.0 460 8.0 396 Bonds 4.6 428 4.9 373 4.9 355 Property 7.5 90 8.0 82 8.0 74 Total market value of assets 1,082 915 825 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,230 1,088 1,068 deficit in the schemes 148 173 243 Related deferred tax asset 49 59 73 Net pension liabilities 99 114 170 Page 39 Mitchells & Butlers Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 Notes to the financial statements continued 8.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the earnings available for shareholders of 133m 2004 118m restated by 511m 2004 559m, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding own shares held in treasury and by employee share trusts.
Diluted earnings per share have been calculated by adjusting basic earnings per share to reect the notional exercise of the weighted average number of dilutive ordinary share options outstanding under the Groups share option schemes.
The resulting weighted average number of ordinary shares is 520m 2004 563m.
In December 2003, the Company combined the payment of a special dividend see note 12 with a 12 for 17 consolidation of its share capital.
These transactions were designed to have the same overall commercial effect, in terms of net assets, earnings and number of shares, as a buy-back of shares at fair value.
Accordingly, earnings per share for prior periods were not restated for the share consolidation.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share are calculated as follows: 2005 2004 53 weeks 52 weeks restated pence pence per ordinary per ordinary notes share share Basic earnings 26.0 21.1 Exceptional items, less tax thereon 9, 11 0.2 Adjusted earnings 26.0 20.9 Restated on the full adoption of FRS 17 Retirement Benets see note 3.

The transitional rules of FRS 15 have been followed, permitting the carrying value of properties as at 1 October 1999 to be retained.
In 1996, a group restructuring by Six Continents resulted in the transfer at book value of certain fixed assets to a subsidiary that subsequently became part of the Mitchells & Butlers group.
The book value included the effect of revaluations undertaken prior to 1996.
Accordingly, the carrying value of the Groups fixed assets reflects those revaluations in its historic cost, which at 1 October 2005 amounted to 386m 2004 392m.
In addition, the carrying value of the Groups xed assets reects the 1999 revaluation see below which at 1 October 2005 amounted to 335m 2004 339m.
The most recent valuation of properties reected in the carrying value of xed assets was undertaken in 1999 and covered all properties then owned by the Group other than leasehold properties having an unexpired term of 50 years or less.
This valuation was undertaken by external chartered surveyors, Chesterton plc, internationally recognised valuers, in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The basis of valuation was predominantly existing use value and had regard to trading potential.

Borrowings continued Securitised debt On 13 November 2003, a group company, Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc, issued 1,900m of secured loan notes in connection with the securitisation of the majority of the Groups UK pubs and restaurants business owned by Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited.
The funds raised were mainly used to repay existing bank borrowings of 1,243m, pay issue costs of 23m and return 501m to shareholders by way of a special dividend see note 12.
The loan notes consist of six tranches as follows: Initial principal Principal outstanding borrowed at 1 October 2005 Tranche m Interest Principal repayment period m Expected WAL A1 200 Floating By instalments 2011 to 2028 200 5 years A2 550 5.574% By instalments 2003 to 2028 507 11 years A3 250 Floating By instalments 2011 to 2028 250 5 years B1 350 5.965% By instalments 2003 to 2023 330 9 years B2 350 6.013% By instalments 2015 to 2028 350 19 years C 200 6.469% By instalments 2029 to 2030 200 24 years 1,900 1,837 The expected remaining weighted average life WAL is based on the amortisation prole of the individual note tranches and assumes renancing of the A1 and A3 notes on the margin step-up dates below.
The notes are secured on substantially all of the Groups property and future income streams therefrom.
Interest on the Class A1 notes is payable at three month LIBOR plus a margin of 0.45%, stepping up to LIBOR plus 0.90% in December 2010.
These notes are fully hedged using interest rate swaps which x the interest rate payable.
The Class A3 notes were issued in principal amount of $418.75m, with interest payable at three month US dollar LIBOR plus a margin of 0.45%, stepping up to US dollar LIBOR plus 0.90% in December 2010.
These notes are fully hedged using currency swaps and interest rate swaps, whereby all principal and interest liabilities are swapped into sterling providing an initial principal of 250m and fixed interest payable.
The overall cash interest rate payable on the loan notes is 6% after taking account of interest rate hedging and the cost of the provision of a financial guarantee provided by Ambac in respect of the Class A notes.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited, the Groups main operating subsidiary.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash, by way of dividends for example, to other group companies.
At 1 October 2005, Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited had short-term deposits and cash of 119m 2004 98m which were governed by the covenants associated with the securitisation.
Of this amount 16m 2004 4m, representing disposal proceeds, was held on deposit in a secured account restricted cash.
The use of this cash requires the approval of the securitisation trustee and may only be used for certain specified purposes such as capital enhancement expenditure and business acquisitions.
The carrying value of the loan notes in the Group balance sheet at 1 October 2005 is analysed as follows: m Principal outstanding at 26 September 2004 1,872 Principal repaid during the period 35 Principal outstanding at 1 October 2005 1,837 Deferred issue costs 20 Accrued interest 4 Carrying value at 1 October 2005 1,821 Page 48 Mitchells & Butlers Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 21.

Financial instruments The Groups treasury policy and use of financial instruments are discussed in the Operating and Financial Review on page 6.
The disclosures in this note exclude short-term debtors and creditors where permitted by FRS 13.
Principal hedging instruments In order to manage interest rate risk, the Group has entered into interest rate and currency swap agreements that x the interest payable on the oating rate tranches of the securitised debt see note 21.
At 1 October 2005, these agreements were for a notional principal amount of 450m 2004 450m.
Currency and interest rate prole of financial assets and liabilities After taking into account the interest rate and currency swap agreements entered into by the Group, the currency and interest prole of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date was: 2005 2004 Non-interest Floating Non-interest Floating Total bearing rate Total bearing rate Financial assets m m m m m m Sterling 194 3 191 219 2 217 Euro 6 6 6 6 200 3 197 225 2 223 Financial assets comprise cash of 129m 2004 81m and current asset investments of 71m 2004 144m.

Floating rate financial assets and liabilities bear interest at market rates based on LIBOR.
Currency risk After taking into account the above hedging arrangements, the Group does not have a material profit and loss account exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities.
In addition, the Group is predominantly UK based and therefore does not have a significant currency exposure from its operations.
Under the provisions of SSAP 20, any foreign exchange gains or losses arising from the translation of overseas net assets are recognised in the statement of total recognised group gains and losses.

The fair value of interest rate and currency swaps is the estimated amount which the Group could expect to pay or receive on the termination of the agreements.
These amounts are based on quotations from counterparties and take into consideration interest and exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Other financial assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or book values approximate to fair values.
Gains and losses on hedges Gains and losses on derivative instruments used for hedging are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged exposure is itself recognised.

Employee share trusts The Company has established two employee share trusts: Share Incentive Plan SIP Trust The SIP Trust was established in 2003 to purchase shares on behalf of employees participating in the Companys Share Incentive Plan.
Under this scheme, eligible employees are awarded free shares which are normally held in trust for a holding period of at least three years.
