FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IFRS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IFRS TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS Notes to IFRS reconciliations continued 10.
STICS Since publication of the 2005 interim results, the Group has revised its treatment of STICS in the light of emerging industry practice.
As a result, STICS are now accounted for as equity with the interest due shown as an appropriation of profit for the year rather than as an expense.
Details of the STICS are set out in note 41 to the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Other adjustments a Non-transferable pension assets When calculating the net pension surplus deficit plan assets exclude non-transferable financial instruments issued by the entity and held by the fund: non-transferable financial instruments include units in linked funds issued by the reporting entity.
The adjustment is purely presentational and does not impact shareholders funds.
However, the variance between actual and expected return on non-transferable assets flows is recognised in the income statement rather than in reserves.
b Deferred tax liabilities The movement in deferred tax represents the deferred tax impact of IFRS adjustments, other than the deferred tax adjustment related to intangibles, which has been included in the business combinations adjustment.
c Recognition of internally generated intangible assets In accordance with IAS 38, certain development expenditure, written off immediately under MSS, must be capitalised.
The deferral of 2004s development costs is offset by the amortisation of previous years capitalised expenses.
d Present value of acquired in-force business Under IAS 12, PVIF is grossed up for taxation and a corresponding deferred tax liability is created.
