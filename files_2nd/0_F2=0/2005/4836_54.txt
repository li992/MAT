As a result of share disposals, allowable losses have been incurred which are available for offset against certain future chargeable gains.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as it is considered that there is insufficient evidence that chargeable gains will arise.
The deferred tax asset not recognised, measured at the standard rate of 30 per cent, is not less than 650 million.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associated undertakings.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on these earnings in the foreseeable future.
