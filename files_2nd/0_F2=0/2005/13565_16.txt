Vesting of the performance shares is based on the achievement of both non-market based conditions EPS and cash ow per share and a market based performance condition TSR.
Further information regarding the operation of the plan can be found on pages 40 and 41 of the  report.
Sharesave share option plan Based on a three or five year monthly savings contract, eligible employees are granted share options with an exercise price of up to 20 per cent below the share price when the contract is entered into.
Vesting of the options is not subject to the achievement of a performance target.
In the UK, the plan is Inland Revenue approved.
Overseas, employees in 28 countries participate in sharesave plans through arrangements broadly comparable to the UK plan.
A small proportion of the sharesave options are settled in cash.
Further information regarding the operation of the plan can be found on page 41 of the  report.
Executive Share Option Plan ESOP This plan involves the grant of market value share options to participants.
The options are subject to a non-market based performance condition growth in EPS.
The options have a maximum contractual life of ten years.
Further information regarding the operation of the plan can be found on page 41 of the Directors remuneration report.
There was no grant of executive share options in 2004 or 2005.
Following the introduction of the PSP, it is not intended to grant any further executive share options.
Annual Performance Related Award plan APRA deferred shares Deferred shares awarded as part of the APRA.
One third of the value of any annual bonus is delivered in the form of a deferred share award.
The release of deferred share awards is not dependent on the achievement of any further performance conditions other than that participants remain an employee of the Group for two years from the date of the award in order to retain the full number of shares.
During the two year deferral period, participants are entitled to receive dividends on the deferred shares.
Share Incentive Plan SIP The Free Shareelement of the Share Incentive Plan SIP.
Eligible employees receive shares with a value of up to one weeks salary.
There are no conditions attached to the shares.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2, the Group has recognised an expense in respect of all grants under these plans made after November 7, 2002 and unvested at January 1, 2005.
The Group recognised a total expense of 26m 2004 19m.

qxd 15 3 06 07:58 Page 85 85 27 Share-based payments continued Fair values The weighted average fair values for PSP awards, Sharesave grants, APRA deferred share awards, and SIP Free Share awards made during the year are as follows: 2005 2004 Pence Pence PSP 282p 249p Sharesave 3 year 131p Sharesave 5 year 154p APRA deferred share awards 260p 220p SIP Free Share awards 257p 231p Details of the assumptions used in the calculation of these fair values are set out below.
Expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the seven years prior to the grant or award date.
Expected dividends were based on the Companys payments to shareholders over the five years prior to the grant or award date.
PSP awards The fair value of shares awarded under the PSP are calculated using the market value of shares at the time of the award adjusted to take into account non-entitlement to dividends during the vesting period and the TSR performance condition.
The PSP fair values were calculated using the following assumptions: 2005 2004 Weighted average share price 262p 233p Expected dividends 7.81p 7.61p Volatility 34% 35% Correlation 19% 22% Expected life 3 years 3 years Risk free interest rate 4.9% 5.2% As explained on page 41 of the  report, the PSP has a Total Shareholder Return TSR market-based performance condition, such that the Companys TSR over the performance period will be compared with the TSR of the companies constituting the FTSE 100 index on the date of grant.
If the Companys TSR exceeds the median TSR of the FTSE 100, the number of shares that vest will be increased by 25 per cent.
The fair value of an award of shares under the PSP has been adjusted to take into account this market-based performance condition using a pricing model based on expectations about volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the group of FTSE 100 companies and which incorporates into the valuation the interdependency between share price performance and TSR vesting.
This adjustment increases the fair value relative to the share price at the date of grant.
Sharesave awards The fair value of options granted under the Sharesave plan are calculated using a binomial pricing model with the following assumptions: 2005 2004 Weighted average share price 351p Exercise price 298p Volatility 40% Expected dividends 7.86p 1 Expected life 3 year Sharesave 3.3-3.8 years 5 year Sharesave 5.3-5.8 years Close periods: From January 1 6 weeks 6 weeks From July 1 1 month 1 month Risk free interest rate 4.4% 1 The binomial pricing model assumes that participants will exercise options at the beginning of the six month window if the share price is greater than the exercise price.
Otherwise it assumes that options are held until the expiration of their contractual term.
This results in an expected life that falls somewhere between the start and end of the exercise window.
Deferred shares under APRA and Free Shares under SIP The fair value of shares awarded under these plans is calculated as the share price on the date of award.

qxd 15 3 06 07:58 Page 87 87 28 Financial instruments The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange rate risk: interest rate risk: and commodity price risk.
The Board has approved policies for the management of these risks.
In accordance with the option allowed by IFRS 1 First time adoption of IFRS, the Group has adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial  from January 1, 2005, and consequently information for 2005 is provided on this basis.
For 2004, information has been provided on the previously published basis under UK GAAP.
Risk management policies and hedging activities Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Group has significant cash ows most signicantly US dollars, followed by the Euro denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant trading entity.
To manage its exposures to changes in values of future foreign currency cash ows, so as to maintain relatively stable long-term foreign exchange rates on settled transactions, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign currency transactions.
For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.
The Group also has exposures to the fair values of non-derivative financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies.
To manage the risk of changes in these fair values, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign exchange contracts, which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes.
The Group regards its interests in overseas subsidiary companies as long-term investments.
The Group aims to match its translational exposures by matching the currencies of assets and liabilities.
Where appropriate, foreign currency financial liabilities may be designated as hedges of the net investment.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its xed rate borrowings fair value risk and oating rate borrowings cash ow risk.
Interest rate derivatives are used to manage the overall interest rate prole within the Group policy, which is to maintain a higher proportion of net debt at xed rates of interest having regard to the prevailing interest rate outlook.
These are designated as either fair value or cash ow hedges as appropriate.
Commodity risk The Group has exposures to the price of jet fuel and base metals arising from business operations.
To minimise its cash ow exposures to changes in commodity prices, the Group enters into derivative commodity transactions.
Other price risk The Groups cash equivalent balances represent investments in money market instruments, with a term of up to one month.
The Group does not consider that these are subject to significant price risk.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to hold financial investments and maintain undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the Group has available funds to meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
The Group holds cash and short-term investments, which together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
The Group has credit policies covering both trading and financial exposures.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments.

qxd 15 3 06 07:58 Page 89 89 28 Financial instruments continued Fair values of financial instruments The fair value of a financial instrument is the price at which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
Fair values have been determined with reference to available market information at the balance sheet date, using the methodologies discussed below.
The carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial instruments are as follows: 2005 Book value Fair value m m Assets Unlisted non-current investments 52 52 Cash at bank and in hand 338 338 Short-term deposits and investments 1,456 1,456 Trade receivables 963 963 Other financial assets: Derivative financial assets 464 464 Other non-derivative financial assets 258 258 Liabilities Trade payables 1,538 1,538 Borrowings current 75 74 non-current 1,458 1,530 Other financial liabilities: Derivative financial liabilities 143 143 Financial risk and revenue sharing partnerships 423 454 B Shares 7 7 Other non-derivative financial liabilities 246 246 Unlisted xed asset investments These primarily comprise Floating Rate Convertible Loan Stock.
The conversion conditions are such that fair value approximates to the book value.
Trade receivables, trade payables, short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents Fair values are assumed to approximate to cost either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of the investments is reset after periods not exceeding six months.
Borrowings, other financial assets and other financial liabilities Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been estimated by discounting expected future cash ows using prevailing interest rate curves.
Amounts denominated in foreign curencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.

Cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits and short-term borrowings: The book value approximates to fair value either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of investments is reset after periods not greater than six months.
Derivatives: The fair value of derivatives is the estimated amount, based on current market rates, which the Group would expect to pay or receive were it to terminate the derivatives at the balance sheet date.
Hedges of future transactions As described in the Finance Directors review on pages 24 to 29 the Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: Interest rate risk using interest swaps Currency exposures on future forecast sales using forward foreign currency contracts, currency swaps and currency options Commodity price risk using jet fuel swaps Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are dealt with as outlined in the accounting policies on page 59.

The Groups contingent liabilities relating to nancing arrangements are spread over many years and relate to a number of customers and a broad product portfolio.
Under UK GAAP, contingent liabilities were reported: a at the full potential exposure regardless of the time at which such exposures may arise: and b in sterling taking account of forward exchange contracts held.
Following the adoption of IFRS, the Group has reviewed this policy and has concluded that it is more appropriate to disclose contingent liabilities on a discounted basis.
As directors consider the likelihood of these contingent liabilities crystallising to be remote, this amount does not represent a present value.
However, the amounts will be discounted at the Groups borrowing rate to reect better the time span over which these exposures could arise.
In addition, following the decision to cease hedge accounting from January 1, 2005, it is no longer appropriate to take account of forward exchange contracts.
As the contingent liabilities are denominated in US dollars, this amount will be reported, together with the sterling equivalent at the reporting date spot rate.
Applying this revised policy, the discounted value of the total gross contingent liabilities relating to nancing arrangements on all delivered aircraft less insurance arrangements and relevant provisions, at December 31, 2005 amounted to $1,097m 638m, 2004 $1,143m, 595m, previously reported 999m.
Taking into account the net realisable value of the relevant security including unrestricted cash collateral of $108m 63m, 2004 $104m, 54m, the discounted value of the net contingent liabilities in respect of nancing arrangements on all delivered aircraft amounted to $259m 150m, 2004 $294m, 153m, previously reported 189m.
Sensitivity calculations are complex, but for example, if the value of the relevant security was reduced by 20 per cent, a net contingent liability with a discounted value of approximately $363m 211m, 2004 $403m, 210m, previously reported 277m would result.
There are also net contingent liabilities in respect of undelivered aircraft, but it is not considered practicable to estimate these as deliveries can be many years in the future, and the relevant nancing will only be put in place at the appropriate time.
Contingent liabilities exist in respect of guarantees provided by the Group in the ordinary course of business for product delivery, performance and reliability.
The Company and some of its subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, entered into arrangements in respect of export finance, performance bonds, countertrade obligations and minor miscellaneous items.
Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which are for substantial amounts.
As a consequence of the insolvency of an insurer as previously reported, the Group is no longer fully insured against known and potential claims from employees who worked for certain of the Groups UK based businesses for a period prior to the acquisition of those businesses by the Group.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the directors do not expect any of these arrangements, legal actions or claims, after allowing for provisions already made, to result in significant loss to the Group or Company.

An analysis of the impact of implementing IFRS was published in a news release on April 14, 2005, available on the Investors section of the Groups website www.
com The major changes required by the introduction of IFRS were: recognition of intangible assets, whereby certain qualifying costs, in particular related to research and development and recoverable engine costs, which were written off under UK GAAP, are required to be recognised and amortised over a future period of time: treatment of financial instruments, whereby the majority of financial assets and derivatives, employed by the Group to provide stability for long-term business planning, for example in respect of foreign exchange rates, will be fair-valued on the balance sheet with subsequent changes in fair values recorded in the income statement, unless cash ow hedge accounting is applied: financial risk and revenue sharing partnerships, whereby a balance sheet liability is required to be established to reect the expected future value of payments to partners: pensions and other post-retirement costs, whereby pension scheme deficits are required to be recorded on the balance sheet: the cessation of amortisation of goodwill: and the recording of share-based payments at fair value.
The Group achieved hedge accounting under UK GAAP.
However the strict methodology to achieve hedge accounting under IAS 39 limits its application for use by the Group unless there are significant changes to the way in which the Group operates its economic hedging policies.
The Group has determined that its existing hedging strategy is in the best interests of the business and its shareholders.
It has not, therefore, altered its hedging activities in order to achieve a particular accounting presentation under the new rules.
The Group has applied hedge accounting to its interest rate derivative hedge book, but has not applied cash ow hedge accounting to its foreign exchange and commodity derivative hedge books.
Details of the adjustments made in adopting IFRS are provided below.
Reconciliations for the 2004 restated opening and closing balance sheets, income statement and cash ow are also provided.
Presentation of financial statements The Groups primary financial statements have been presented in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
The principal impact on the income statement is the presentation of the Groups share of the results of joint ventures which are accounted for using the equity method as a single line.
Under UK GAAP, the Groups shares of operating profit, interest and taxation were reported separately.
As a consequence, the Groups share of joint venture taxation is included in profit before tax.
There is no impact on reported profit after tax.
The format of the balance sheet has been amended to include the items required by IAS 1 to be presented on the face of the balance sheet.
Transitional arrangements The rules for the first-time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS 1.
In general, a company is required to determine its IFRS policies and apply those retrospectively to determine its opening balance sheet under IFRS.
IFRS 1 allows a number of exemptions to this general requirement.
Where Rolls-Royce has applied these exemptions, they are noted in the relevant section below.
In particular the Group has adopted the exemption that IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial Instruments need not be applied to the comparative period.
Consequently the restated results for the year ended December 31, 2004 have been prepared using the accounting policies for financial instruments previously adopted under UK GAAP.
This has led to a second transition at January 1, 2005, details of which are provided below, together with a balance sheet reconciliation.
qxd 15 3 06 07:58 Page 97 97 33 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued Research and development IAS 38 requires that all development costs meeting specified criteria be capitalised as intangible assets.
As part of its IFRS transition project, Rolls-Royce reviewed all development projects, whether the costs were previously recognised under UK GAAP or not, to determine whether the criteria in IAS 38 were met.
The key eligibility criteria for capitalisation relate to: i Identication of development costs.
In general, research and development activities are closely interrelated and it is not until the technical feasibility of the project can be determined with reasonable certainty that development costs can be separately identied: and ii The generation of future economic benefit.
Intangible assets are not recognised unless the project is expected to generate future economic benefit exceeding the amount capitalised.
Certain expenditures on internal product development meet all the criteria of IAS 38 and have therefore been capitalised.
Development costs capitalised are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period not exceeding 15 years.
The impact arising from this change is summarised as follows: At Year ended January 1, December 31, 2004 2004 m m Income statement Capitalisation of internal expenditure 11 Amortisation of intangible asset 17 Adjustment to profit before taxation 6 Net assets Intangible asset cost 246 257 Intangible asset accumulated amortisation 86 103 160 154 Related tax effect 48 46 Adjustment to net assets 112 108 Recoverable engine costs On occasions, the Group may sell original equipment to customers at an amount below its cost of manufacture, with the expectation that this deficit will be recovered from future aftermarket sales to the original customer.
Where the Group has a contractual right to supply aftermarket parts to the customer and its intellectual rights, warranty arrangements and statutory airworthiness requirements provide reasonable control over this supply, these arrangements are considered to meet the denition of an intangible asset.
Under UK GAAP, these intangible assets were required to be written-off as they arose: under IAS 38 such intangible assets are required to be recognised.
The resulting intangible asset will be amortised over the expected utilisation period of the equipment by the initial customer generally to a maximum of ten years, subject to any specic contractual circumstances.
The impact arising from this change is summarised as follows: At Year ended January 1, December 31, 2004 2004 m m Income statement Capitalisation of intangible assets previously written off in 2004 21 Amortisation of intangible assets 26 Elimination of related inventory provision recognised under UK GAAP 5 Adjustment to profit before taxation 10 Net assets Intangible assets cost 208 229 Intangible assets accumulated amortisation 88 114 120 115 Elimination of related inventory provision recognised under UK GAAP 14 9 134 124 Related tax effect 40 37 Adjustment to net assets 94 87 Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005 2005 Group Financials.
qxd 15 3 06 07:58 Page 98 98 Notes to the financial statements continued 33 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued Goodwill and business combinations IFRS 3 Business Combinations prohibits the amortisation of goodwill.
Instead, it requires goodwill to be carried at cost.
Annual impairment tests are required to be performed.
The Group has applied the exemption granted by IFRS 1 to apply IFRS 3 prospectively from the date of transition to IFRS.
This has the following impact: All prior business combination accounting is frozen at the transition date: and The value of goodwill is frozen at the transition date and amortisation previously reported under UK GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2004 is reversed for the IFRS restatement.
The impact arising from this change is summarised as follows: At Year ended January 1, December 31, 2004 2004 m m Income statement Reversal of goodwill amortisation relating to subsidiaries 47 Reversal of goodwill amortisation relating to joint ventures 1 Adjustment to profit before taxation 48 Net assets Reversal of goodwill amortisation 48 48 Related taxation effect 1 Adjustment to net asset 47 Pensions and other post-retirement benets IAS 19 Employee Benets requires separate recognition of the operating and nancing costs of dened benefit pension schemes and similarly funded employee benets in the income statement.
The standard permits a number of options for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
The Groups policy is to recognise immediately any variations in full in a statement of recognised income and expense, as permitted in the IASBs amendment to IAS 19 entitled Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures.
The cash funding of the plans is designed, in consultation with independent qualied actuaries, to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.
The impact arising from this change is summarised as follows: At Year ended January 1, December 31, 2004 2004 m m Income statement Adjustments to operating profit 42 Adjustments to nancing costs 1 Adjustment to profit before taxation 41 Net assets Eliminate amounts recognised under SSAP 24 Prepaid pension contributions 239 263 Provision for pension costs 160 159 Include IAS 19 pension liability 1,466 1,409 1,545 1,513 Related taxation effect 447 437 Adjustment to net assets 1,098 1,076 Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005 2005 Group Financials.

The fair value is calculated using an option-pricing model and is charged to income over the relevant vesting periods, adjusted to reect actual and expected levels of vesting.
The basis of calculation for deferred taxation is in respect of all schemes including pre November 7, 2002 grants and is the difference between the market price at the date of the financial statements and the option exercise price.
This will not necessarily correlate to the fair value charge.

Based on the IAS 27 Denitions of Control, and after taking into account the facts and circumstances relevant at the transition date, the Group determined that it controlled one arrangement Pembroke 717 Holdings Limited that was not required to be consolidated under UK GAAP.
The consolidation of this company did not have any net impact on the reported results for 2004.

In addition, under IAS 12 Income Taxes, certain temporary differences, for example in respect of capital losses and unremitted earnings from joint ventures, which previously were not recognised under UK GAAP, will be recognised.

IAS 32 covers disclosure and presentation, while IAS 39 covers recognition and measurement including detailed rules for hedge accounting.
These include the requirements to match the hedged item to the hedging instrument and to measure hedge effectiveness.
IAS 39 requires certain financial assets and certain financial liabilities to be recognised at fair value.
Accounting for movements in fair value is dependent on the designation of the relevant financial instrument and whether hedge accounting is adopted.
The Group has applied the exemption, granted by IFRS 1, not to apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 to its comparative gures for 2004.
On January 1, 2005, the fair value of foreign exchange and commodity derivatives were included in a transition hedging reserve.
As the Group has not adopted cash ow hedge accounting for future foreign exchange transactions under IAS 39 from January 1, 2005, the reserve was frozen and will be released to the income statement based on the designated maturities on that date.
The impact on the Groups derivative financial instruments is described below.
Foreign exchange derivatives A large element of the Groups trading is denominated in US dollars and a significant portion of its costs is incurred in sterling and Euros.
In order to protect itself from the associated currency volatility, the Group takes significant levels of forward cover.
Under UK GAAP, gains or losses on this cover are not recognised in the income statement until realised, matching them with the underlying transactions.
As contracts may be signed several years in advance of delivery, delivery dates may change and meeting the strict criteria for hedge accounting in IAS 39 is not considered to be practicable within the current risk management practices.
Rolls-Royce considers that it could amend its risk management practices to achieve hedge accounting.
However, Rolls-Royce believes that its current risk management practices are in the best economic interests of shareholders and should not be amended purely to achieve a particular accounting treatment.
Accordingly, Rolls-Royce has decided not to adopt cash ow hedge accounting for forecast foreign exchange transactions.
Rolls-Royce will continue to hedge its future forecast US dollar income on a portfolio basis, which it considers is the most efficient economic basis for doing so.
As a result of not hedge accounting for forecast foreign exchange transactions, the movements on the fair value of derivative contracts held for the purpose of hedging these transactions will be recognised in the income statement.
The size of this movement in fair values will be largely dependent on movements in spot exchange rates.
Under UK GAAP, as part of its hedging policy, Rolls-Royce: recognised revenues and costs at the average exchange rate achieved in the year: recognised monetary assets and liabilities at the rate expected to be achieved in settling these items, taking account of the foreign exchange cover in place: incorporated rates achieved on forward cover in its assessment of the profitability of service and long-term contracts.
Under IFRS, Rolls-Royce will: recognise revenues and costs at the exchange rate at the time of the transaction: recognise monetary assets and liabilities at the spot exchange rate on the reporting date: and assess the profitability of service and long-term contracts without including the impact of forward exchange rate contracts.
Rolls-Royce will adopt fair value hedge accounting for foreign exchange derivatives entered into for the purposes of hedging the fair values of borrowings denominated in a foreign currency.
Under fair value hedge accounting, the borrowings being hedged will be measured at fair value in respect of the foreign exchange risk, with movements in fair values of both the derivatives and the borrowings being included in the income statement.
Rolls-Royce will adopt net investment hedge accounting in respect of foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency denominated borrowings.
Under net investment hedging, foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the fair value of the borrowings are included in equity to the extent they offset equivalent losses and gains arising on the consolidation of the subsidiary.
This policy is unchanged from UK GAAP.
qxd 15 3 06 07:58 Page 101 10 1 33 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued Interest rate derivatives Rolls-Royce will adopt hedge accounting for hedges entered into for the purposes of managing its exposure to movements in interest rates.
Fair value hedge accounting will be used for the hedging of xed rate borrowings and cash ow hedge accounting will be used where the underlying borrowing is a oating rate instrument.
Where fair value hedge accounting is used, the debt being hedged will be measured at fair value in respect of the interest rate risk, with movements in the fair values of both the derivative and the debt being included in the income statement.
Where cash ow hedge accounting is used, the effective element of the fair value of the derivative will be included in a hedging reserve in equity.
This hedging reserve will be released to the income statement to offset changes in interest rates on the hedged oating rate borrowings.
Risk and revenue sharing partnerships Risk and revenue sharing partnership RRSP agreements are a standard form of co-operation in the civil aero-engine industry.
In general, partners share: investment in the programme: market risk as they receive their return from future sales: currency risk as their returns are denominated in US dollars: sales nancing obligations: warranty costs: and, where they are manufacturing or development partners, technical and cost risk.
As part of the IFRS transition project, RRSP arrangements have been reviewed to assess whether they are financial instruments as dened by IAS 32.
Following this review, certain partnerships, where the arrangement is not part of an overall supplier arrangement, will be reclassied as financial instruments on transition to IFRS.
Reclassied RRSP arrangements are accounted for using the amortised cost method, based on the effective interest rate at the inception of the transaction.
Government investment In the past, Rolls-Royce has received investment in certain projects from the UK Government.
Under UK GAAP, these amounts were recognised as income when they were received with the levies being recognised as they became due on engine delivery.
A similar review to that for RRSPs concluded that these arrangements were not financial instruments and that no changes are required to the accounting treatment.
Other financial derivatives The Group has an ongoing exposure to the price of jet fuel from business operations.
For reasons similar to those described for foreign exchange above, Rolls-Royce will not adopt hedge accounting for its exposures to changes in the price of jet fuel.
These are hedged using commodity swaps.
The Group has entered into forward contracts to purchase its own shares for the purposes of meeting obligations to issue shares under employee share schemes.
Under UK GAAP, these contracts were not recognised until the shares were purchased and issued to employees.
Under IAS 32, these contracts are categorised as financial liabilities and accounted for on the amortised cost basis.
The Company has issued non-cumulative redeemable convertible preference shares B Shares as an alternative to paying a cash dividend.
Under IAS 32 these shares are categorised as financial liabilities.
The impact of the transition to IFRS on the net assets in respect of financial instruments as at January 1, 2005 is summarised as follows: m m Net assets Amortised cost value of risk and revenue sharing partnerships 455 Related taxation effect 130 325 Fair value of foreign exchange derivatives 996 Revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities to spot rate 91 Foreign exchange within service and other long-term contracts 54 Related taxation effect 242 609 Fair value of interest rate derivatives 15 Related taxation effect 4 11 Fair value of commodity derivatives 9 Related taxation effect 3 6 Amortised cost value of contracts to purchase own shares 115 Related taxation effect 8 123 Reclassication of B Shares as a liability 5 5 Adjustment to net assets 151 Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005 2005 Group Financials.
qxd 15 3 06 07:58 Page 102 102 Notes to the financial statements continued 33 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued Contingent liabilities The Groups customer nancing arrangements fall into two categories that need to be considered separately for IFRS purposes: Credit Based Guarantees Credit based guarantees are specically exempt from being treated as financial derivatives under IAS 39.
They are required to be treated as insurance contracts in accordance with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts.
Under IFRS 4 the existing UK GAAP treatment FRS 12 is grandfathereduntil such time as the new Insurance Contracts standard comes into effect.
Asset Value Guarantees AVGs The treatment of AVGs is less well dened under IFRS.
The Group has treated AVGs as insurance contracts in accordance with IFRS 4, as it considers that this treatment best reects the underlying nature of the arrangements.
There are no material changes to the treatment of contingent liabilities upon transitioning from UK GAAP to IFRS.
Other The Groups banking covenants are not affected by the transition to IFRS as they are based on UK GAAP prevailing at the time the relevant borrowing facility was entered into frozen UK GAAP.
The Groups borrowing powers under its Articles of Association were amended at the 2004 AGM to a xed limit in anticipation of the transition to IFRS.
The Scheme of Arrangement and the reduction in share capital undertaken in 2003 provides Rolls-Royce Group plc with a buffer in respect of Distributable Reserves available inter alia for the purposes of making payments to shareholders.
