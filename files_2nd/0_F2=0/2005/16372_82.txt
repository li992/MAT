10 Goodwill and intangible assets indefinite-lived intangible assets principally comprise those trademarks for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inows.
These are considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the level of marketing support.
Finite-lived intangible assets, which primarily comprise patented and non-patented technology, know-how, and software, are capitalised and amortised in operating profit on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected useful lives, none of which exceeds ten years.
The level of amortisation for nite-lived intangible assets is not expected to change materially over the next five years.

There are no significant carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets that are allocated across multiple cash generating units.
Impairments in the year During 2005, Slim Fast maintained its leadership of the weight management sector by refreshing its product range and offering a more personalised diet plan.
However, the 2005 impairment review of the global Slim Fast business resulted in an impairment charge of 363 million due to the continued decline of the weight management sector.
This charge has been reected in operating profit for The Americas region.
Value in use of the business was calculated using the present values of projected future cash ows, adjusted to reect the risk present in the markets in which the business operates.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to the business was 11%.
As a result of the impairment review, the carrying value of the business was determined to be in excess of the value in use, thereby requiring an impairment loss to be recognised.
The 2004 impairment charge of 791 million in relation to the Slim Fast business was calculated using value in use and applied a pre-tax discount rate of 11%.
This charge was also reected in operating profit for The Americas region.
The remainder of the impairment loss charged in 2005 of 19 million includes 2 million representing write-downs in respect of planned business disposals that will complete during 2006, and 10 million in respect of impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in Colombia and India.
In 2004, the remaining balance of 212 million included 156 million in respect of planned business disposals in 2005.
Other smaller impairments were recognised during the course of 2004 for tea plantations and a bakery business in India, and a home and personal care business in North Africa.
significant cash generating units The goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets held in the global savoury and dressings cash generating unit CGU, comprising 11.9 billion and 3.6 billion respectively, are considered significant in comparison to the total carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at 31 December 2005.
During 2005, we conducted an impairment review of the carrying value of these assets.
Value in use of the global savoury and dressings CGU has been calculated as the present value of projected future cash ows.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10% was used.
The following key assumptions were used in the discounted cash ow projections for the savoury and dressings CGU: a longer-term sustainable growth rate of 2%, adjusted for market fade, used to determine an appropriate terminal value multiple: average near-term nominal growth for the major product groups within the CGU of 4%: and average operating margins for the major product groups within the CGU ranging from 19% to 23%.
The growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on past performance and our experience of growth rates and margins achievable in our key markets as a guide.
We believe that the assumptions used in estimating the future performance of the savoury and dressings CGU are consistent with past performance.
The projections covered a period of 10 years as we believe this to be a suitable timescale over which to review and consider annual performance before applying a xed terminal value multiple to the final year cash ows of the detailed projection.
Stopping the detailed projections after 5 years and applying a terminal value multiple thereafter would not result in a materially different estimate of the value in use.
The growth rates used to estimate future performance beyond the periods covered by our annual planning and strategic planning processes do not exceed the long-term average rates of growth for similar products.
We have performed sensitivity analysis around the base case assumptions and have concluded that no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the savoury and dressings CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
