Selected Quarterly Financial Data Unaudited Our revenue from the sale of passenger tickets is seasonal.
Historically, demand for cruises has been the greatest during our third quarter which includes the Northern Hemisphere summer months.
This higher demand during the third quarter results in higher net revenue yields and, accordingly, the largest share of our net income is earned during this period.
Substantially all of Holland America Tours and Princess Tours revenues and net income are generated from May through September in conjunction with the Alaska cruise season.
