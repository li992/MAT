Notes to the Consolidated Financial statements 14.
Other financial assets continued b Bank balances and cash Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
c Credit risk The groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables.
The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Other than as noted in a above, the group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
At the balance sheet date, the group has unused tax losses of $61.9 million 2004: $27.8 million available for offset against future profits against which no deferred tax asset has been recognised due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
These losses expire at various dates up to 2024.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are immaterial.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates to their fair value.
