Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The following accounting policies have been consistently applied in dealing with items considered material in relation to the accounts.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries are prepared under the historical cost convention and are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
However, compliance with FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets relating to the capitalisation and amortisation of goodwill requires a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 as explained below.
On 7 July 2003 Kesa Electricals Group the Group demerged from Kingfisher plc and its ordinary shares were listed on the London Stock Exchange and on the Premier March of Euronext Paris SA.
The financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with those used in the preparation of the financial information contained within the Listing Particulars of the Group dated 17 June 2003.
The following summarises the key principles applied by the Directors in preparing the financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared using merger accounting principles as if the companies comprising the Group had been part of the Group in all reported periods.
Upon demerger, the Group used funds drawn from new banking facilities to make a payment of 588.2m to Kingfisher plc in settlement of the remaining funding balances.
The Groups interest charge prior to demerger includes interest payable to Kingfisher plc on the total funding balances.
From 2 February 2003 to the date of demerger, interest payable to Kingfisher plc is charged on the liability remaining after the capitalisation.
Following demerger, the Groups net reported financing costs only reflect the cost of the external borrowings of the Group.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associated undertakings.
Subsidiary undertakings acquired are recorded under the acquisition method and their results are included from the date of acquisition.
Associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method and joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
The results of subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associated undertakings that have been disposed of during the year are included up to the effective date of disposal.
Datart Investments S. A. make up their accounts to 31 December owing to local conditions and to avoid undue delay in the presentation of the Group accounts.
In the Company balance sheet, investments in subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost.
Kesa Electricals plc has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at contracted rates or, where no contract exists, at average monthly rates.
The profit and loss accounts and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries and associates are translated into sterling at weighted average rates of exchange, other than substantial exceptional items which are translated at the rate on the date of the transaction.
Balance sheets are translated at closing rates.
Exchange differences on the re-translation at closing rates of the opening balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries and associates are taken to reserves, less exchange differences arising on related foreign currency borrowings and financial instruments.
Tax charges and credits arising on such items are also taken to reserves.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange under the related foreign currency contract.
46 Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2004 05 1 Accounting policies continued The Groups share of net assets or liabilities of associated undertakings and joint ventures is expressed in sterling at year-end exchange rates.
The Groups share of profits or losses for the year is expressed in sterling at average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net equity and the Groups share of profits or losses for the year are recorded as a movement on reserves.
Exchange differences arising on borrowings used to finance, or provide a hedge against, Group equity investments in foreign subsidiaries are recorded as movements on reserves.

Franchise income Income from franchisees principally relating to franchise fees and commissions is recognised in other income in the period to which it relates.
Cost of sales Cost of sales represents expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the product to the point of sale, including warehouse and transportation costs.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions is stated at cost less amortisation.
Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions after 31 January 1998 is treated as an asset on the balance sheet.
Where goodwill is regarded as having a limited estimated useful economic life, it is amortised on a systematic basis over its life.
Where goodwill is regarded as having an indefinite life, it is not amortised.
The estimated useful economic life is regarded as indefinite where goodwill is capable of continued measurement and the durability of the acquired business can be demonstrated.
Where goodwill is not amortised, an annual impairment review is performed and any impairment charged to the profit and loss account.
Negative goodwill, being the excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired over the fair value of the purchase price, is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis, generally over a period equivalent to the realisation of the non-monetary assets acquired.
In estimating the useful economic life of goodwill, account has been taken of the nature of the business acquired, the stability of the industry, the extent of continuing barriers to market entry and expected future impact of competition.
With the exception of BUT, all acquisitions since 31 January 1998 are considered by the Directors to have an estimated useful economic life not exceeding 20 years.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of shares in BUT, in the financial year 1998, was 135.1m.
The Directors consider that BUT has a proven ability to maintain its market leadership over a long period and will adapt successfully to any foreseeable technological or customer-led changes, such that the business will prove to be durable.
Accordingly, the goodwill in relation to BUT is deemed to have an indefinite useful economic life and hence is not amortised and, in order to give a true and fair view, the financial statements depart from the requirement to amortise goodwill over a finite period, as required by the Companies Act.
Instead, annual impairment tests are undertaken and any impairment that is identified is charged to the profit and loss account.
In the event the Group had amortised goodwill over 20 years, the result would be to reduce profit before tax by 7.0m and net assets by 53.4m.
Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2004 05 47 Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are included in the balance sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is charged to reflect a reduction from book value to estimated residual value over the estimated useful life of the asset to the Group.
The Group selects its depreciation rates carefully and reviews them regularly to take account of any changes in circumstances.
When setting useful economic lives, the principal factors the Group takes into account are the expected rate of technological developments and the intensity at which the assets are expected to be used.
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated by the straight-line method to residual value and the annual rates applicable to the principal categories are: Freehold buildings 20 years Long leaseholds 20 years or lease term if shorter Short leaseholds over remaining period of the lease Tenants fixtures and improvements between five and 20 years Computers and electronic equipment between two and four years Motor cars and commercial vehicles between two and five years Intangible fixed assets 20 years Land is not depreciated.
Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill Tangible fixed assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net realisable value of the relevant income-generating unit or the value in use if higher.
Net realisable value is calculated by reference to the amount at which the asset could be disposed of.
Value in use is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows obtainable as a result of the assets continued use, including those resulting from its ultimate disposal, at a market-based discount rate on a pre-tax basis.
The carrying values of fixed assets and goodwill are written down by the amount of any impairment and this loss is recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which it occurs.
If the occurrence of an external event gives rise to a reversal of an impairment loss, the reversal is recognised in the profit and loss account and by increasing the carrying amount of the fixed asset or goodwill in the period in which it occurs.
The carrying amount of the fixed asset or goodwill will only be increased up to the amount that it would have been had the original impairment not occurred.
Leases Where assets are financed by leasing agreements that give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they have been purchased outright.
The amount capitalised is the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term.
The corresponding lease commitments are shown as obligations to the lessor.
Lease payments are analysed between capital and interest elements using the annuity method.
Depreciation on the relevant assets and interest is charged to the profit and loss account.
All other leases are operating leases and the rental payments are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis.
Incentives received to enter into lease agreements are released to the profit and loss account over the lease term or, if shorter, the period to the date on which the rent is first expected to be adjusted to the prevailing market rate.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes appropriate attributable overheads.
Rebates receivable from suppliers Rebates receivable from suppliers are credited to the carrying value of the stock to which they relate.
Where a rebate agreement with a supplier straddles the financial year end, the rebates are recognised in the period in which they are earned.
48 Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2004 05 1 Accounting policies continued Pensions The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
Pension liabilities are funded by monthly or annual contributions.
Under the defined benefit schemes, pension liabilities are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the long-term cost of pensions over the service lives of employees.
Variations from regular cost are spread over the average remaining service lives of current employees.
Defined contribution scheme pension liabilities are charged to the profit and loss account as they fall due.
The impact of the phased implementation of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits on these financial statements is discussed in note 26.
Deferred taxation Provision is made for deferred taxation using the incremental provision approach, which ensures future tax consequences of past transactions and events are recognised as liabilities or assets.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at each balance sheet date.
Financial instruments Financial assets are recognised on the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Discounts and premia are charged or credited to the profit and loss account over the life of the asset or liability to which they relate.
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for using hedge accounting to the extent that they are held to hedge a financial cash flow, asset or liability.
Outstanding contracts used to hedge against cash flows, which themselves will be accounted for in the profits or losses of a future period, are not recognised, or are deferred when they mature, and are carried forward against corresponding gains and losses when they occur.
When a financial instrument ceases to be a hedge either as a result of the underlying asset or liability being extinguished, or because a future event is no longer likely to occur, the instrument will thereafter be marked to its fair value in the financial statements.
Income and expenditure arising on financial instruments held for hedging purposes is recognised on an accruals basis and credited or charged to the profit and loss account in the financial period in which it arises.
Issue costs on debt are capitalised and amortised over the life of the debt.
Employee share schemes The cost of awards to employees that take the form of shares or rights to shares are recognised over the period of the employees related performance.
Where there are no performance criteria, the cost is recognised when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the shares.
The cost of awards is measured as the fair value of the award at grant date less employee contributions.

This provision arises through accounting for the UK pension costs under SSAP 24 see note 26.
The remaining pension provision of 1.9m 2004: 1.9m relates to overseas pension schemes.
Within the onerous property contracts provision, the Group has provided against future liabilities for all properties sublet at a shortfall and long-term idle properties.
The provision is based on the value of future cash outflows relating to rent, rates and service charges.
Due to the uncertainty relating to the timing of disposals and the related difficulty in predicting future subleases, it is not possible to determine when this provision will be utilised.

26 Pension costs France In France the main pension benefits are provided through the state system.
The Group is also legally required to pay lump sums retirement indemnities to employees when they retire from service.
In addition the Group provides a supplementary funded, defined benefit plan Supplementary Pension Plan for its top executives.
The retirement indemnities and Supplementary Pension Plan are funded though insurance policies.
SSAP 24 The Group determines payments to the retiring employees and the contributions to the retirement indemnities and Supplementary Pension Plan after taking actuarial advice.
The pension cost charged to the profit and loss account represents the payments made directly to retiring employees and contributions paid into the insurance policies: which totalled 2.1m 2004: 1.2m.
An annual review confirms this equates to the SSAP 24 charge.
FRS 17 The Accounting Standards Board announced a deferral of full mandatory adoption of FRS 17.
Therefore, the transitional disclosure requirements of FRS 17 have been followed in the Groups financial statements.
A qualified independent actuary has updated the most recent actuarial valuations of the Groups defined benefit schemes in France as at 31 January 2005.
The major assumptions used are as follows: 2005 2004 2003 %%% Discount rate 4.5 4.75 5.1 5.0 Salary escalation 2.5 3.0 2.0 2.5 2.0 2.5 Rate of pension increases n a n a n a Price inflation 2.0 2.0 2.0 Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2004 05 69 Notes to the financial statements 26 Pension costs continued The assets in the schemes, the expected future rates of return on these assets and the estimated liabilities of the scheme as at 31 January 2005 were: 2005 2004 2003 m % m % m % Insurance policies 14.5 5.0 15.7 5.0 13.6 5.0 Total market value of assets 14.5 15.7 13.6 Present value of liabilities 40.0 32.8 24.3 Deficit in the scheme 25.5 17.1 10.7 Related deferred tax asset 7.7 5.1 3.2 Net pension deficit 17.8 12.0 7.5 Analysis of amount charged to operating profit 2005 2004 m m Current service cost 1.8 1.6 Past service cost 0.3 3.8 Total operating charge 2.1 5.4 Analysis of the amount credited to other finance income 2005 2004 m m Expected return on insurance policies 0.7 0.7 Interest on retirement benefit liabilities 1.7 1.3 Net return 1.0 0.6 Analysis of the statement of total recognised gains and losses STRGL 2005 2004 m m Actual return less expected return on insurance policies 0.9 As a percentage of scheme assets 6.2% Experience loss arising on scheme liabilities including exchange rate 4.9 As a percentage of present value of scheme liabilities 12.3% Changes in assumptions underlying present value of scheme liabilities 0.4 1.2 Total actuarial loss recognised in STRGL 6.2 1.2 As a percentage of present value of scheme liabilities 15.5% 3.7% 70 Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2004 05 26 Pension costs continued Movement in deficit during the year 2005 2004 m m Deficit in scheme at start of year before tax 17.1 10.7 Current service cost 1.8 1.6 Past service cost 0.3 3.8 Employer contribution 0.7 0.8 Other finance income net 1.0 0.6 Actuarial loss recognised in STRGL 6.2 1.2 Currency translation movement 0.2 Deficit in scheme at end of year before tax 25.5 17.1 UK In the UK, the Group participated in the Kingfisher pension arrangements until 1 April 2004, when the Group established its own UK arrangements.
All current and former members of the Kingfisher Pension Scheme a defined benefit scheme were transferred to a new Group defined benefit scheme, the Comet Pension Scheme, which was then closed to new entrants.
All other employees were offered access to a new Group defined contribution pension scheme.
SSAP 24 A formal actuarial valuation of the Comet Pension Scheme was carried out by an independent professionally qualified actuary at 1 April 2004, using the projected unit method, when the relevant assets and liabilities of the scheme were transferred to the Comet Pension Scheme from the Kingfisher Pension Scheme.
The Comet Pension Scheme received a bulk transfer in respect of past service benefits from the Kingfisher Pension Scheme on 16 December 2004.
The actuarial valuation was updated to 31 January 2005 by an independent professionally qualified actuary using the projected unit method of funding.
The contribution made to the scheme in the year was 8.2m 2004: 7.8m.
Further contributions are agreed to continue at 13.5 per cent of pensionable salary per annum.
In addition, contributions of 0.5m per month will be made in respect of the schemes deficit.
As the scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost will increase as new members of the scheme approach retirement.
In this valuation, the assets were taken at their market value of 129.2m excluding AVCs.
The principal assumptions adopted were an inflation rate of 3.0 per cent per annum, an investment return on future contributions of 6.9 per cent per annum, pensionable pay increases of 4.6 per cent per annum and pension increases of 2.8 per cent per annum.
On this basis, the assets were sufficient to cover 77 per cent of the schemes liabilities.
As the Group continued to participate in the Kingfisher Pension Scheme until 1 April 2004, as if the demerger from Kingfisher plc on 7 July 2003 had not taken place, it is not possible to accurately determine the assets and liabilities attributable to employees of the Group for the year ended 31 January 2004.
However the Group made an estimate of the SSAP 24 pension charge for the year to 31 January 2004 and the contributions paid into the Kingfisher Pension Scheme of 7.8m in 2004 2003: 7.9m were in line with the contribution rate as advised by the actuary following the 2002 valuation.
The pension cost for the Group for the Comet Pension Scheme charged in the profit and loss account is 8.2m amount charged for the Kingfisher Pension Scheme in 2004: 10.2m: 2003: 9.0m.
This is based on the formal actuarial valuation described above, adjusted to reflect market movements since the date of this valuation, and in accordance with SSAP 24.
Variations against regular cost have been amortised using the straight-line method.
The pension cost for the Comet Pension Scheme is 2.2m higher 2004: 2.4m higher in respect of the Kingfisher Scheme than the contributions paid into the Scheme by the Group during the year.
As a result, the provision on the balance sheet has increased to 6.6m 2004: 4.4m.
The total pension charge in the profit and loss account includes 0.7m 2004: 0.9m for the UK defined contribution scheme.
FRS 17 The major assumptions used by the actuary as at 31 January 2005, together with the related FRS17 information is shown below.
As the Group participated in the Kingfisher Pension Scheme until 1 April 2004, it was not possible to accurately determine the assets and liabilities attributable to employees of the Group for the year ended 31 January 2004.
The Group has therefore taken advantage of the multi-employer exemption allowed by paragraph 9 b of FRS 17, but assets and liabilities have been estimated as shown overleaf.
