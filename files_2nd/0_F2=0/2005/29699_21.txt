SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 45 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements of the Company and the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, which comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, and International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee IASC that remain in effect, and to the extent that they have been adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRSs are given in note 2, note 34 and note 35.
IFRSs as adopted by the EU differ in certain respects from IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
However, the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented would be no different had the Company applied IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
References to IFRSs hereafter should be construed as references to IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trusts issued by the Association of Investment Trusts AITC in January 2005 is consistent with the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis compliant with the SORP.
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except when otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Financial statements of all Group companies are prepared for the same reporting period.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and are presented separately in the income statement and within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders equity.
However, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Presentation of income statement In order to better reflect the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AITC, supplementary information which analyses the income statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the income statement.
In accordance with the Companys status as a UK investment company under section 266 of the Companies Act 1985, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Companys contractual right to the cash flow from the asset expires or substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligation is discharged, with gains and losses recognised in the income account.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 46 Notes to the accounts continued Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value.
As the Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income or capital gains, such financial assets are designated as fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition.
Incidental costs on acquisition of such assets are expensed.
Financial assets designated as fair value through profit or loss are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which for investment funds is at their net asset value based on the fair value of the underlying investments.
Quoted instruments are valued at either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
In respect of unquoted instruments, or where the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is established by using recognised valuation methodologies, in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital IPEVC Valuation Guidelines.
New investments are initially carried at cost, for a limited period, being the price of the most recent investment in the investee.
This is in accordance with IPEVC Guidelines as the cost of recent investments will generally provide a good indication of fair value.
Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
Gains and losses arising from investments, designated as investments held at fair value through profit or loss, are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on fair value through profit or loss investments are included within the changes in its fair value.
Current financial assets Financial assets purchased with a view to subsequent resale to an associated entity warehoused investments are carried at fair value, being the proposed transfer price of the asset, and included in current assets.
Investments in subsidiaries In its separate financial statements the Company recognises its investment in subsidiaries at cost, unless they are investment vehicles, in which case they are included at fair value.
Investments in associates In accordance with IAS 28 Investments in Associates, the standard does not apply to investments held in associates by venture capital organisations that are designated as fair value through profit and loss.
Such investments are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they occur.
An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Convertible loan notes Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the group, is included in equity.
Issue costs are allocated proportionately to the liability and equity components.
The carrying amount to maturity of the liability component is measured at amortised cost.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 47 Share-based payments The group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The cost of equity-settled share-based payments with employees of the Group are measured at fair value at the date of grant and recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate valuation model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any non-market vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the consolidated income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
No expense is recognised in the Companys income statement as there are no options issued in consideration for the provision of employee services to the Company.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Interest income is classified within operating activities in the cash flow statement.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment has been established and is classified within operating activities in the cash flow statement.
The Companys revenue and capital gains are expected to be derived primarily from future distributions in respect of its holdings in fund investments.
The Company will account for such distributions by reference to the underlying source of the distribution.
Realised profits on capital distributions which arise from the realisation of investments within the funds will be credited to the income statement and taken to the Companys capital reserve.
Income distributions will be credited to the income statement and taken to the Companys revenue reserve.
Management and advisory fee income are accrued over the period for which the service is provided.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The group as lessee Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
All borrowing costs are charged directly to revenue and are classified within operating activities in the cash flow statement.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The costs relating to defined benefit schemes are accounted for in the same way as for defined contribution schemes where the group is unable to identify its share of the underlying performance and financial position of the plan with sufficient reliability for accounting purposes.
Such situations arise where the contributions payable by the Group are set in terms of the scheme as a whole and, as such, there is no consistent and reliable basis for allocating the Groups obligations, plan assets, or costs.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 48 Notes to the accounts continued Other employee benefits Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees.
A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of the Company is pounds sterling.
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Investment trusts which have approval under Section 842 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Property, plant and equipment Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost, including direct acquisition costs, less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost less estimated residual value of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Telecommunications and office equipment 10% 20% Leasehold improvements 10% Computer equipment 20% 33% The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 49 The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment purposes.
Assets are classified as cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to cash and are not subject to significant changes in value.
The Company has classified short-term bank deposits, investments in money market funds and short-dated treasury bills as cash equivalents.

SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 50 Notes to the accounts continued 2 IFRS restatement continued Major differences between UK GAAP and IFRS a Under IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement: quoted investments previously reported at mid-market value are now shown at bid price and classified as investments held at fair value through profit and loss.
In addition, marketability discounts previously applied to quoted valuations are no longer applied.
The effects of these changes are recorded in the Income Statements and are included in notes 34 and 35. b Under IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement: convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the group, is included in equity and are included in notes 34 and 35. c Under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: the Group has to recognise a charge to income in respect of the fair value of outstanding share options granted to employees after 7 November 2002.
The fair value has been calculated using a Stochastic option valuation model and is charged to income over the relevant vesting periods, adjusted to reflect actual and expected levels of vesting.
The total costs of these options are recorded in the Income Statements and are included in notes 34 and 35. d There are other reclassifications in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.

SVGA and the Schemes trustees, taking advice from the independent actuaries, agree the contributions.
In accordance with IAS 19, the Scheme is accounted for as a defined contribution scheme on the basis that the Group is unable to readily identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Scheme at the balance sheet date as there is no consistent and reliable basis for allocating the obligations, plan assets and costs to the Group.
Further details of the Scheme can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts of Schroders plc.
In particular, the Scheme had 419 active members in the defined benefit section at 31 December 2005 and the accounts of Schroders plc disclosed a net pension asset in respect of the Scheme of 8.8 million, calculated under IAS 19 based on interim valuations prepared by independent qualified actuaries.

As detailed in note 33, the Company has agreed that it should focus its future investments mainly on Permira Funds.
As such, and given that our largest exposures currently are to Permira Funds, we expect that the future performance of the Company will be largely dependent on the future performance of the Permira Funds in which we invest.

Nicholas Ferguson and members of his family and Andrew Williams have an interest in the Carried Interest in respect of certain private equity funds.
With the introduction of the Executive Share Option Plan in May 2001, Nicholas Ferguson and Andrew Williams gave up a portion of their entitlement to Carried Interest on existing private equity funds and any entitlement they may have to Carried Interest on certain private equity funds launched after 2001 in return for share options granted by the Company under the Executive Share Option Plan.
Nicholas Ferguson and Andrew Williams also participate in the Schroder Ventures Co-Investment Scheme and Schroder Ventures Investments Limited.
They have received no new carried interest allocations and made no new commitments since they joined SVG Capital in 2001.
Damon Buffini has a material interest in contracts entered into by the Company with Permira during the year as more fully described in the Report of the Directors.
No other Director has any material interest in any other contract that is significant to the Companys business.
The Directors are the only key management personnel of the Company.
Details of their remuneration are included in the Remuneration Report.
On 8 May 2003, SVG Advisers Limited SVGA, a wholly owned subsidiary of SVG Capital plc, assigned a debt in respect of a future revenue stream for 2.28 million due from Schroder Investment Management Ireland Limited to SVG Capital plc for consideration of 2.28 million.
The loan was fully repaid during the year.
In July 2005, the Company invested 15 million representing a 21% interest in Strategic Equity Capital plc SEC, a UK-listed investment trust managed by SVG Investment Managers Limited SVG IM, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SVG Capital plc.
SVG IM earned management fees of 0.2 million 2004: nil during the year from SEC, of which 0.1 million 2004: nil was outstanding at the year-end.
In March 2005, the Company transferred interests in some of its private equity funds to SVG Diamond Holdings Limited Diamond I, a fund in which the Company holds a 36% equity interest and SVG Advisers Limited is the Investment Adviser.
In particular, the Company made full or partial transfers of the following funds: Permira UK III: Schroder Canadian Buy-Out Fund II: SV Life Sciences Fund: SV Life Sciences Fund II: and SV Investments Fund I.
These funds were all transferred at fair value, for total proceeds of 25 million.
The Company has warehoused various private equity fund investments for subsequent transfer to Diamond I and SVG Diamond Holdings II Limited Diamond II.
SVG Capital plc is a significant investor in both these funds Diamond II closed on 22 February 2006, which are also advised by SVGA, a wholly-owned subsidiary.
All funds warehoused by SVG Capital plc were subject to forward sale agreements whereby they would be transferred, subject to compliance with the investment guidelines of Diamond I and II, at cost plus an interest charge, based on 6 month Euribor plus a margin of 2% per annum.
During the year the Company made primary commitments to four private equity funds that were subsequently transferred to Diamond I.
No calls were made on these funds prior to transfer and therefore no consideration was involved.
The Company also made six primary commitments to, and eight secondary purchases of, private equity funds.
The total cost of these fund investments amounted to 40.6 million 2004: nil at 31 December 2005 note 17.
Interest of 0.6 million 2004: nil was accrued at the year-end.
Diamond II closed on 22 February 2006 and the funds are in the process of being transferred.
During the year SVGA received 1.5 million of BBB-rated Diamond I Loan Notes, as part of its ongoing investment advisory fee arrangements.
These Notes were purchased from SVGA by SVG Capital plc at par value on the date of issue, as the holding of investments is the main activity of the parent company.
In addition, SVGA received investment advisory fees in cash during the year from Diamond I of 1.6 million 2004: nil.
At 31 December 2005, the Company had an uncalled commitment of 51.4 million 2004: 50.3 million to Diamond I note 20.
There were no dividends paid by subsidiaries during the year 2004: none.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 71 33 Risk Financial instruments and risk profile The Companys principal investment objective is to achieve capital appreciation by investing primarily in an international portfolio of buy-out and development capital funds, which are managed or advised by Schroder Ventures or Permira.
These investments are typically illiquid.
In addition, the Company holds money market instruments, cash and short-term deposits and various items such as debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
These financial instruments held by the Company are generally liquid.
The holding of securities, investing activities and associated financing undertaken pursuant to this objective involves certain inherent risks.
Events may occur that would result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of revenue profits available for dividend.
As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long term.
The Company has not taken out any derivatives contracts to date.

Floating rate financial assets consist of short-term deposits and money market funds.
Fixed rate financial assets comprise Treasury Bills, which have a known yield to redemption.
All financial assets are included at fair value.
b Financial liabilities of the Group The Company issued 49.0 million nominal of 10 year 4.5% Subordinated Convertible Bonds in the year ended 31 December 2003.
The Company does not have any other borrowings at the balance sheet date, although it does have in place a loan facility of 285 million with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and HBOS plc.
The 2013 Bonds are included in the balance sheet at 43.0 million.
This compares to a fair value estimate of 73.0 million note 19.
The main risk arising from the Companys financial instruments is valuation risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policy for managing this risk as summarised below.
This policy has remained substantially unchanged since the launch of the Company.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 72 Notes to the accounts continued 33 Risk continued Currency risk The Company is exposed to currency risk directly since the majority of its assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currency and their sterling value can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Company does not normally hedge against foreign currency movements affecting the value of its investments, but takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
The Company does have a 285 million loan facility which, if drawn, would act as a hedge against the currency risk on the value of its euro-denominated assets.
Interest rate risk The Companys revenue will be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates since the majority of its income ordinarily derives from money market instruments and bank deposit interest.
It also pays interest on short-term loans that may be taken out from time to time.
The effect of interest rate changes on the valuation of investments and debt forms part of valuation risk, which is considered separately below.
At 31 December 2005, the Company held investments in money market funds valued at 40.7 million 2004: 11.0 million, earning interest at market rates.
The money market funds were redeemable on less than 24 hours notice.
Other floating rate financial assets comprised cash at bank or short-term deposits.
At 31 December 2005, the Company held investments in short-dated treasury bills valued at 127.3 million 2004: nil, earning interest at a weighted average rate of 2.1%.
The treasury bills had maturity dates ranging from 5 January 2006 to 23 February 2006.
Valuation market price risk The Companys exposure to valuation risk comprises mainly movements in the value of its underlying investments.
A breakdown of the Fund portfolio is given on pages 18 to 20 and a detailed analysis of the 20 largest underlying companies is given on pages 11 to 15.
In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, set out on pages 45 to 49, all underlying investments are valued at fair value by the Directors in accordance with the current International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines IPEVC.
The IPEVC guidelines contain detailed methodology setting out best practice with respect to valuing unquoted investments.
The Company does not hedge against movements in the value of these investments.
Uncertainty arises as a result of future changes in the valuation of the Companys underlying investments, the majority of which are unquoted, and the effect changes in exchange rates may have in the sterling value of these investments.
Development-stage equity investments and early-stage equity investments, by their nature, involve uncertainty as to the ultimate value likely to be realised on the disposal of those investments, particularly as their unquoted nature means that a ready market may not exist for them.
The Companys sensitivity to valuation risk will be affected by changes in levels of borrowing and liquidity, as approved by the Board.
At 31 December 2005, a 10% movement in the valuation of the Groups investments designated as fair value through profit and loss, would result in a 8% change in net asset value per share.
The Board manages valuation risk by reviewing and approving the valuation of the private equity fund portfolio.
Commitment liquidity risk The nature of investing in buy-out and development capital funds entails making significant financial commitments, as shown in note 20.
At 31 December 2005, the Group had significant uncalled commitments of 364.1 million 2004: 464.5 million, compared to its consolidated net assets of 903.0 million 2004: 709.4 million.
As noted in the Chairmans statement, the Company is considering making a substantial commitment to Permiras next private equity fund, Permira IV, which will be launched shortly.
It is anticipated that over the longer term, and in normal circumstances, commitments would be financed by distributions received on the realisation of existing investments.
In addition, the Group had a 285 million loan facility at the year-end that could be drawn on to meet commitments as they fall due.
In order to support the Companys proposed commitment to Permira IV, the Board is considering funding options, including increasing its current bank facility and issuing long-term debt see note 18.
However, a residual risk remains that the Group could be unable to meet its future commitments in full.
If as a consequence of a failure to pay a call, the Company is treated as a defaulting investor under the relevant Fund, it will suffer a resultant dilution in interest and possibly the compulsory sale of its interest.
The Board manages liquidity risk by regularly reviewing cash flow forecasts and available funding options.
Commitments to fund investments are reviewed by the Investment Committee and approved by the Board.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 73 33 Risk continued Holdings risk In certain circumstances, the Company may wish to transfer its holdings in particular Funds.
In a majority of the Funds in which the Company will invest, the general partner, trustee or manager has the ultimate right, similar to that exercisable by a board of a private company, to refuse to register the transfer of an interest.
While the Company has no reason to believe that any request for the transfer of an interest would be refused, it is of course conceivable that the general partners, trustees or managers overriding fiduciary duty could result in its refusing to register a particular transfer proposed by the Company.
Concentration risk The Directors believe that the diversified nature of the Companys portfolio and the number of underlying investments in the Funds reduces the risks normally associated with making investments in the buy-out and development capital markets.
However, it should be noted that the Company intends to focus future investments on a smaller number of private equity managers, particularly Permira.
As outlined in note 9, the future performance of the Company will therefore be largely dependent on the future performance of the Permira Funds in which we invest.
The Directors believe that this represents an opportunity, but investors should also be aware that greater concentration of the investment portfolio also presents a risk.
Following a review of its future investment policy during the year, the Board concluded that the Companys core focus should remain on international private equity and, within that, its primary focus should be on Europe and, to a lesser extent, Japan.
While the Company will continue to have valuable commitments in the US in smaller company buy-outs and in the life sciences sectors, the Board believes that the buy-out markets of Europe and Japan will provide excellent investment opportunities over the next five to ten years.
Within these two markets the Board has decided to concentrate the Companys investments with our existing, highly rated investment advisers, Permira and MKS Advisers.
SVG Capital plc has therefore entered into agreements with Permira referred to in the Report of the Directors and approved by shareholders on 25 April 2005, which give the Company full access to the next two funds which Permira is expected to raise, Permira IV and Permira V, and which strengthen the Companys long-standing relationship with Permira.

Explanation of material adjustments to the Group cash flow statement for the year ended 31 December 2004 The transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has no effect upon the reported cash flows generated by the Group.
The IFRS cash flow statement is presented in a different format from that required under UK GAAP with cash flows split into three categories of activities operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
The reconciling items between the UK GAAP presentation and the IFRS presentation have no net impact on the cash flows generated.
In preparing the cash flow statement under IFRS, cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, highly liquid interest bearing securities with original maturities of three months or less, and bank oversdrafts.
Under UK GAAP highly liquid interest bearing securities were not classified as cash equivalents.
