Share Based payments 2005 Performance Share Plan PSP Under the PSP senior executives can receive conditional awards of rights over whole shares worth up to 150% of salary p. a.
Awards will vest under the PSP subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR based performance condition under which the Companys TSR performance will be measured over the fixed three year period against both the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts the Index and a comparator group of Oil and Gas companies.
Half of an award will be tested against the Index and the other half against the comparator group.
The test is over a three year period starting on the 1 January prior to grant, and an individual must normally remain in employment for three years from grant for the shares to vest.
No dividends are paid to participants over the vesting period.
Further details in relation to the PSP award measurements are provided in the Remuneration Report.
The shares outstanding under the PSP are as follows: PSP Shares Share price at grant Outstanding at 1 January 2005 Granted 1,784,417 187.5 Outstanding at 31 December 2005 1,784,417 187.5 The inputs of the option valuation model were: Risk free interest rate 4.1% p. a.
Expected volatility 33% Dividend yield 0.93% p. a.
The expected life is the period from grant to vesting date.
The weighted average fair value of the awards granted in 2005 was 112.8p per award.
The Company recognised a total expense of 311,000 2004: nil in respect of the PSP.
2000 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The only share option scheme operated by the Company during the year was the 2000 ESOS.
Options granted under the 2000 ESOS normally only become exercisable following the third anniversary of the date of the grant if the performance condition has been met.
The awards are tested against the FTSE Index and 100% of awards will vest if the Companys TSR is above the median company of the Index over the three year period following grant.
Options awarded under the 2000 ESOS before 24 May 2005 are subject to monthly re-testing on a rolling three year basis if the TSR performance criterion is not met.
Options granted on or after 24 May 2005 are not subject to monthly re-testing.
Options have previously been granted under the 1988 ESOS and the 1998 ESOS.
Options granted under the 1988 ESOS and the 1998 ESOS are not subject to performance conditions.
All awards under the 1988 ESOS and the 1998 ESOS were made prior to 7 November 2002 and therefore, under the transitional provisions, they have not been accounted for in accordance with FRS 20 Share Based Payments.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of, and movements in, share options during the year.
