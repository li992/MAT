The Group operates in a number of countries subject to regulations under which a local subsidiary undertaking has to maintain a minimum level of capital.
The current policy of the Group is that local capital requirements are met, as far as possible, by the retention of profit.
Certain countries operate exchange control regulations which limit the amount of dividends that can be remitted to non-resident shareholders.
It is not possible to determine the amount of profit retained and other reserves that is restricted by these regulations, but the net profit retained of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures at 31st December 2005 totalled 3,980m 2004: 1,606m.
If such overseas reserves were to be remitted, other tax liabilities, which have not been provided for in the accounts, might arise.
