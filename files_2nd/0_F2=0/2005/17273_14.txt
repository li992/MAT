Foreign Currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at contracted rates or, where no contract exists, at average monthly rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies which are held at the year-end are translated into sterling at year-end exchange rates.
Exchange differences on monetary items are taken to the profit and Loss Account.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Intangible assets, which comprise goodwill arising on acquisitions and acquired licences and copyrights, are stated at cost less amortisation.
Goodwill is the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired.
Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions is treated as an asset on the Balance Sheet and is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life not exceeding 20 years.
In estimating the useful economic life of goodwill arising, account is taken of the nature of the business acquired, the stability of the industry, the extent of continuing barriers to market entry and expected future impact of competition.
With the exception of Streets Online Limited which has been fully provided for, all acquisitions are considered by the Directors to have an estimated useful economic life of 20 years.
Acquired intellectual property rights, licences and copyrights are amortised over the period of the underlying legal agreements, which do not exceed 20 years.
Depreciation Tangible xed assets are stated at cost valuation less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation of tangible xed assets is provided where it is necessary to reect a reduction from book value to estimated residual value over the estimated useful life of the asset to the Group.
Depreciation of tangible xed assets is calculated by the straight-line method and the annual rates applicable to the principal categories are: Freeholds 2 per cent Long leaseholds 5 per cent Short leaseholds over the life of the lease Tenants improvements shorter of ten years and the remaining life of the store lease Fixtures and ttings between 10 per cent and 15 per cent Computers and electronic equipment between 20 per cent and 50 per cent Motor cars 25 per cent 1 Commercial vehicles 33 3 per cent As permitted by Financial Reporting Standard 15 Tangible Fixed Assets the Group has adopted a policy of not revaluing freehold properties and previously revalued freehold properties are included at their valuation less accumulated depreciation.
Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill For acquired goodwill an impairment review is carried out at the end of the first full year following an acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of the asset against the higher of net realisable value or value in use.
The value in use is determined from estimated discounted future cash ows.
Discount rates used are based on the circumstances of the individual businesses.
31 Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Accounts continued Disposal of Land and Buildings profits and losses on disposal of land and buildings represent the difference between the net proceeds and the net carrying value at the date of sale.
Sales are accounted for when there is an unconditional exchange of contracts or where the completion cannot be unreasonably withheld.
Operating Leases All operating lease payments are charged to the profit and Loss Account on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Finance Leases Assets funded through finance leases are capitalised as xed assets and depreciated in accordance with the policy for the class of asset concerned.
The resulting lease obligations are included in creditors net of finance charges.
Interest costs on finance leases are charged to the profit and loss account.
Stocks Stocks, which solely comprise nished goods, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes appropriate attributable overheads.
Provisions are made for obsolescence, mark-down and shrinkage.
Rebates Receivable from Suppliers Volume related rebates receivable from suppliers are credited to the carrying value of the stock to which they relate.
Where a rebate agreement with a supplier covers more than one year the rebates are recognised in the period in which they are earned.
Pensions Companies within the Group offer either a dened benefit scheme or facilitate a Stakeholder arrangement for employees.
The dened benefit scheme is a separate fund and is being held in a separately administered trust to meet the actuarial liabilities.
The estimated costs of pensions in respect of the dened benefit scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so that they are spread over the working lives of employees.
Variations to pension costs arising at each actuarial valuation date caused by differences between the assumptions used and actual experience are spread over the average future working lifetime of employees.
Further details which also include the Groups adoption of the transitional arrangements for Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benets are provided in note 29.
Deferred Taxation Provision is made for deferred taxation using the full provision method in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred Taxation.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable in the foreseeable future out of suitable taxable profits from which the underlying timing difference can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not discounted.
Derivative Financial Instruments Financial assets are recognised on the Balance Sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Discounts and premia are charged or credited to the profit and Loss Account over the life of the asset or liability to which they relate.
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for by using hedge accounting to the extent that they are held to hedge a financial asset or liability.
Where such instruments do not hedge an underlying asset or liability, they are accounted for using fair value accounting.
When a financial instrument ceases to be a hedge, either as a result of the underlying asset or liability being extinguished, or because a future event is no longer likely to occur, the instrument will thereafter be marked to its fair value in the financial statements.
Income and expenditure arising on financial instruments for hedging purposes is recognised on an accruals basis, and credited or charged to the profit and Loss Account in the financial period in which it arises.
Gains or losses on financial instruments accounted for on a fair value basis are reected in the profit and Loss Account as they arise.

Pension Costs During the year the Group implemented changes to the Woolworths Group Pension Scheme a funded dened benefit scheme and the Woolworths Group Retirement Trust a dened contribution scheme.
These changes were aimed at providing appropriate arrangements with secure funding for the Group and were disclosed last year.
Woolworths Group Retirement Trust WGRT Colleagues who joined after 3 June 2003 are no longer eligible to join the WGRT although existing membership is allowed to continue.
Payments to the WGRT are charged against profits as incurred.
The pension cost for this scheme, charged to the profit and loss account, is 0.5 million, reecting contributions paid to the WGRT 2004: 0.6 million.
Woolworths Group Pension Scheme WGPS Colleagues who joined after 3 June 2003 are now subject to different eligibility conditions and terms within the WGPS.
The main conditions are a one-year wait before voluntary entry and a 6 per cent contribution rate for members.
Actuarial valuation Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs The pension cost calculated in accordance with the SSAP 24 accounting standard has been assessed by independent actuaries, based on a valuation of the WGPS as at 1 April 2002 using the projected unit method and the following principal financial assumptions.
Per cent pa Price ination 2.8 Pay increases 3.8 Pension increases 2.7 Discount rate before retirement 7.25 Discount rate after retirement 6.0 Assets were taken at market value, 165.2 million, and represented 94.7 per cent of the value of the schemes liabilities after allowing for future pay increases.
The past service deficit on the SSAP 24 assumptions therefore amounted to 9.3 million.
The Group has continued to contribute to the WGPS at the rate of 13.5 per cent of pensionable pay.
The Groups contribution rate will be reviewed at the next formal valuation, due no later than 1 April 2005.
Under SSAP 24 the pension cost for the year to 29 January 2005 is 13.7 million 2004: 16.2 million, which is split into a regular cost of 12.5 million 2004: 15.0 million and a variation of 1.2 million 2004: 1.2 million.
However, contributions from the participating employers into the scheme over the year to 29 January 2005 amounted to 16.0 million 2004: 16.2 million and this higher amount has been charged to the profit and loss account.
At 29 January 2005 there was a prepayment of nil 2004: nil on the balance sheet in respect of pensions.
The Groups funding policy differs from the accounting policy to the extent that different assumptions are used in setting the funding policy of the scheme.
The funding policy has been set using the following assumptions per annum : a discount rate for past service benets of 6.25 per cent, a discount rate for future service benets of 6.5 per cent, pay increases of 4.0 per cent, and price ination and pension increases of 2.5 per cent.
