15 Derivative financial instruments Financial instruments The Groups objectives and policies on managing the risks that arise in connection with derivatives, including the policies for hedging, are included in Note 54 under the headings, Financial Risk Management, Interest Rate Risk, Credit Risk, Currency Risk and Liquidity Risk.
The notional amounts of certain types of financial instruments provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the balance sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Groups exposure to credit or price risks.
The derivative instruments become favourable assets or unfavourable liabilities as a result of fluctuations in market rates or prices relative to their terms.
The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial instruments on hand, the extent to which instruments are favourable or unfavourable and, thus the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly.
The fair value of a derivative contract represents the amount at which that contract could be exchanged in an arms-length transaction, calculated at market rates current at the balance sheet date.
The disclosure of financial instruments in respect of 2004, excluding the impact of IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4, can be found in Note 60.
The fair values and notional amounts of derivative instruments held for trading are set out in the following table: 2005 Notional Fair value contract Year ended 31st December 2005 amount Assets Liabilities Derivatives held for trading m m m Foreign exchange derivatives Forward foreign exchange 585,635 7,574 6,707 Currency swaps 351,319 8,316 8,045 OTC options bought and sold 244,810 2,595 2,516 OTC derivatives 1,181,764 18,485 17,268 Exchange traded futures bought and sold 2,304 Exchange traded options bought and sold 6 Foreign exchange derivatives 1,184,074 18,485 17,268 Interest rate derivatives Interest rate swaps 7,311,939 68,341 67,669 Forward rate agreements 1,345,368 431 434 OTC options bought and sold 1,267,683 12,256 11,598 OTC derivatives 9,924,990 81,028 79,701 Exchange traded futures bought and sold 1,862,606 Exchange traded options bought and sold 826,351 Exchange traded swaps 2,760,110 Interest rate derivatives 15,374,057 81,028 79,701 Credit derivatives Swaps 609,381 4,172 4,806 Equity and stock index derivatives OTC options bought and sold 208,068 9,974 13,067 Equity swaps and forwards 8,108 328 164 OTC derivatives 216,176 10,302 13,231 Exchange traded futures bought and sold 52,454 Exchange traded options bought and sold 26,789 Equity and stock index derivatives 295,419 10,302 13,231 Commodity derivatives OTC options bought and sold 68,377 4,070 3,881 Commodity swaps and forwards 211,541 17,674 17,336 OTC derivatives 279,918 21,744 21,217 Exchange traded futures bought and sold 50,244 Exchange traded options bought and sold 11,871 435 680 3.5 Commodity derivatives 342,033 22,179 21,897 Derivative assets liabilities held for trading 17,804,964 136,166 136,903 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2005 161 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31st December 2005 15 Derivative financial instruments continued The fair values and notional amounts of derivative instruments held for risk management are set out in the following table: 2005 Notional Fair value contract Year ended 31st December 2005 amount Assets Liabilities Derivatives held for risk management m m m Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges Currency swaps 14 1 Interest rate swaps 27,042 230 290 OTC interest rate options bought 782 1 Exchange traded interest rate swaps 11,899 Commodity swaps and forwards 343 193 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 40,080 232 483 Derivatives designated as fair value hedges Currency swaps 1,686 81 Interest rate swaps 29,394 387 190 Equity options 1,084 36 46 Forward foreign exchange 28 14 OTC interest rate options bought 1,287 Derivatives designated as fair value hedges 33,479 423 331 Derivatives designated as hedges of net investments Currency swaps 5,919 2 254 Derivatives designated as hedges of net investment 5,919 2 254 Derivative assets liabilities held for risk management 79,478 657 1,068 The Groups total derivative asset and liability position as reported on the balance sheet is as follows: 2005 Notional Fair value contract amount Assets Liabilities Year ended 31st December 2005 m m m Total derivative assets liabilities held for trading 17,804,964 136,166 136,903 Total derivative assets liabilities held for risk management 79,478 657 1,068 Recognised derivative assets liabilities 17,884,442 136,823 137,971 The Group has hedged the following forecast cash flows, which primarily vary with interest rates.
