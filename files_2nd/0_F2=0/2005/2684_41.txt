By the end of the year, the Chief Executive and his new team were no longer preoccupied with the Groups past, and had turned condently to face the future.
A year of transition Over the past year, management has delivered on the promises it made in June 2003.
We completed our exit from the US market at considerably lower cost than originally expected.
This allowed the Chief Executive to concentrate on the restructuring of our UK business and on dening a path Reshaping to a sustainable position in this market.
An enormous amount of work has gone into improving operations and tightening cost controls in the legacy businesses.
Customer focus has our business been central to our new structures.
We are also seeing some excellent groundwork in network development.
A prime example is our investment in Bulldog, the UK broadband operator we acquired last May.
Bulldog gives us network access across the last mile to the customer, enabling us to offer an end-to-end service in competition with BT.
Building our customer base in this way is an important goal as we embark upon investment of 190m over three years in our UK IP-based Next Generation Network.
This new technology offers network economies that will benefit our customers and improve our margins.
In this context, we welcome Ofcoms vision of a UK telecommunications market based on realistic and sustainable competition among players willing to invest in future technological strength.
Our financial disciplines and continued cost-reduction have created a stable framework so that Cable & Wireless can move forward.

We reshaped our UK business into four customerfocused segments, Enterprise, Business, Carrier Services and Bulldog, each led by experienced telecom professionals.

A 99% increase in network availability from Cable & Wireless is helping them do just that.
Carrier Services Cable & Wireless has worldwide coverage across 200 countries and is one of the worlds largest carriers of international voice and data.
Carrier Services generates 45% of UK revenue and operates in a highly competitive market that continues to suffer from over-capacity and declining margins, although these have been partially offset by increased volumes.
Our innovative customer solutions have won notable contracts.
We now enable the Post Ofce to provide a xed line phone service, and won an international termination deal with Skype, the Voice over IP VoIP operator for which we now transport around 100 million minutes a year.
This year we will expand our services to international customers by offering wholesale VoIP.
By taking a Group-wide view of network assets, Carrier Services aims to improve utilisation of our international network.
We continue to develop new services for mobile carriers and launched MMX, a platform to exchange pictures and multimedia messages, developed with Vodafone.
We operate one of the largest Global 3G roaming exchanges and support email roaming for a third of the worlds mobile networks.
We also launched our Global Carrier multi-protocol label switching MPLS service, which can transmit any type of trafc in IP format, including time-sensitive and businesscritical information and we have already signed up eight significant carriers.

Investing in Our unbundling programme has made rapid progress.
We reached our initial target of 400 exchanges in May 2005, broadband seven months ahead of the original timetable.
The Bulldog team, under its new Chief Executive, is now progressing with plans to extend its UK coverage and intends to unbundle an additional 200 exchanges by March 2006 and a further 200 exchanges in the first half of 2006 07 bringing the total number of exchanges unbundled to 800.
This will increase planned investment and start-up losses in 2005 06.

In April we announced investment of 190m over three years to transform our core UK network into a single integrated IP platform, carrying voice, data and internet services.
This decision was driven by the shift in demand in all customer segments towards IP-based products, and the rapid advance in IP technologies.

10 11 2005 Annual review and summary financial statement Ofcom The regulatory framework is fundamental to our business and our investment decisions.
The strategic review by Ofcom, the telecom and media regulator, provides an opportunity to create a more transparent and effective regulatory regime in areas where BT still controls access to customers.
The promised level playing eld must become a reality.
Establishing the appropriate structure and processes to obtain equality of access to BTs local loop assets will enable the market to take thelead in setting prices for products and services where there is already competition.

We are also pleased that the regulator has adopted the principle of equivalence as the tool to deliver parity in the market.

National T elcos Cable & Wireless is the market leader in integrated xed, broadband and mobile services in 34 countries.
Our National Telcos have delivered solid results in the context of an increasingly liberalised environment.
As at 31 March 2005 88% of our National Telco revenues were generated by companies operating in liberalised markets although not all of these are yet fully competitive.
Revenues increased by 10% due to good performances in Panama and Rest of the World, and the acquisition of Monaco Telecom.
Mobile revenues grew by 26% and data and IP revenues grew by 13% year on year.
All revenue changes are expressed at constant currency.

We believe that this increased cross-business co-operation, and sharing of knowledge and expertise across our geographies, will continue on performance to sharpen performance.
