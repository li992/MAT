Retirement benefit schemes The Group operates two pension schemes that cover the vast majority of employees.
Other employees are covered by a national scheme.
The schemes that the Group has established are as follows: Forth Ports PLC Pension Scheme Port of Tilbury London Limited Pension Fund These schemes are of the defined benefit type, providing benefits that are linked to pay near retirement.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate funds that are administered by trustees.
These funds are held separately from the Company assets.
The pension cost relating to these schemes is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
The latest actuarial assessments of the schemes were as at 5th April 2005.
Assets are taken at their market value.
Liabilities are valued using various assumptions which are listed below.
The total pension cost for these schemes was 5.3m 2004 4.6m.
Member contributions are paid in addition.
A number of employees are members of The Former Registered Dock Workers Pension Scheme FRDW scheme.
The Group also has a contractual relationship with self-employed pilots who operate within the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Tay to provide pilotage services.
The selfemployed pilots make payments into the Pilots National Pension Fund PNPF.
The FRDW scheme is a multi-employer defined benefit scheme which was set up many years ago on a national basis to provide pensions to Registered Dock Workers.
The most recent valuation of the FRDW scheme was carried out in 2005 which recorded a small surplus.
On an ongoing basis, it was fully funded.
The total assets and liabilities of the FRDW scheme are not assigned to specific employers.
All new employees joining the Group are entitled to join the Forth Ports scheme: unless they are former Registered Dock Workers, they would not be entitled to join the FRDW scheme.
On the basis that the FRDW scheme is fully funded, the Group does not believe that it has any exposure to this pension scheme.
The employers are not entitled to participate in any surplus arising in the FRDW scheme.
The contributions paid by the Group are accounted for as a defined contribution scheme as the Group is unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities in the scheme.
The Group contributions during the year were 0.2m 2004 0.2m.
The Company and Port of Dundee Limited are the Competent Harbour Authorities in the Firth of Forth and Firth of Tay respectively where they are responsible for the provision of pilotage services.
The pilotage services are provided by self-employed pilots.
At no time have they ever been employed by the Group.
The last PNPF valuation was carried out in December 2004 which showed that there was no deficit on a Minimum Funding Requirement basis, however, there is a deficit on an ongoing basis.
There is currently a dispute over which parties may be responsible for the ongoing deficit.
The Group believes that the worst outcome would result in additional costs of around 400,000 per annum for a limited period which would be recovered by an increase in the pilotage charges.
The key assumptions used in the valuation of the Group and Company pension schemes were as follows: Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at 31st December: 2005 2004 %% Discount rate 4.90 5.40 Rate of compensation increase 3.95 3.85 Pension increases 2.70 2.60 Inflation 2.70 2.60 Assumptions used to determine net pension costs for the year ended 31st December: 2005 2004 %% Discount rate 5.40 5.50 Expected long-term return on plan assets 5.94 6.19 Rate of compensation increase 3.85 3.85 Weighted average life expectancy for mortality tables used to determine benefit obligations at 31st December 2005: 2005 2005 2004 2004 Male Female Male Female Member age 60 current life expectancy 21 24 19 23 Member age 45 life expectancy at age 60 23 26 21 25 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 85 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 32.
