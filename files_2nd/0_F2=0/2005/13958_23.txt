UK Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax In practice, no UK stamp duty need be paid on the acquisition or transfer of ADSs provided that any instrument of transfer is executed outside the UK and subsequently remains at all times outside the UK.
An agreement to transfer ADSs will not, in practice, give rise to a liability to stamp duty reserve tax.
Subject to certain exceptions, a transfer on sale of ordinary shares, as opposed to ADSs will generally be subject to UK stamp duty at a rate of 0.5% rounded up, if necessary, to the nearest 5 of the consideration given for the transfer.
An agreement to transfer such shares will normally give rise to a charge to UK stamp duty reserve tax at a rate of 0.5% of the consideration payable for the transfer, provided that stamp duty reserve tax will not be payable if stamp duty has been paid.
Where such ordinary shares are later transferred to the Depositarys nominee, further stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax will normally be payable at the rate of 1.5% rounded up, if necessary, to the nearest 5 of the value of the ordinary shares at the time of the transfer.
A transfer of ordinary shares by the Depositary or its nominee to the relative ADS holder when the ADS holder is not transferring beneficial ownership gives rise to a UK stamp duty liability of 5 per transfer.
