Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 30.
Contingent Liabilities Banff Contingent Payment The Exchange Agreement which the Group completed with ENI-Agip on 20 March 2002, states that the Group will make a payment to ENI-Agip of 3,000,000 upon production and sale of an aggregate total of 30,000,000 barrels of crude oil from the Banff field, post the effective date of the acquisition of 1 July 2001.
On current projections the payment would be due sufficiently far into the future, as to raise doubt over its likelihood.
The Group will, however, continue to monitor the field and will provide for the payment if it becomes probable that the production target will be reached.
Other Related Party Transactions Sales of US$15,255,000 2004: US$13,666,000 were made by the Group through Lukoil, the other significant shareholder in Yoganoil.
All sales were on an arms-length basis at prevailing domestic market prices.
At 31 December 2005 US$1,419,000 was owed by Lukoil to Yoganoil 2004: US$784,000 in respect of such sales.
Pensions The Group contributes to the personal pension arrangements of Executive Directors and employees up to a specified percentage of salary in lieu of a formal corporate scheme.
Total pension contributions in lieu amounted to 255,000 2004: 237,000 for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Transition to IFRS For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2004, the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
These financial statements, for the year ended 31 December 2005, are the first the Group is required to prepare in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Accordingly, the Group has prepared financial statements which comply with IFRS applicable for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and the significant accounting policies meeting those requirements are described in Note 2.
In preparing these financial statements, the Group has started from an opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2004, the Groups date of transition to IFRS, and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements required by IFRS 1 for the first time adoption of IFRS.
This note explains the principal adjustments made by the Group in restating its UK GAAP balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Where the Groups UK GAAP financial information was based on estimates, the same estimates have been applied in preparing the IFRS financial information.
Where IFRS requires estimates that were not previously required under UK GAAP, they have been based only on those factors existing on the relevant balance sheet date.
This is consistent with treating information received after the balance sheet date as non-adjusting events under IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date.
Estimates not previously required under UK GAAP primarily relate to financial instruments, embedded derivatives and share based payments.
62 | Dana Petroleum plc 2005 Annual Report IFRS 1 permits certain mandatory exemptions and also allows optional exemptions from the application of certain IFRS in order to assist companies with the transition process.
Dana Petroleum has applied all the mandatory exceptions and in addition made the following significant decisions in implementing IFRS: IFRS 2 Share based payments is applied to all share based awards granted after 7 November 2002 that did not vest before 1 January 2005 IFRS 3 Business combinations prior to 1 January 2004 have not been restated IAS 21 Cumulative translation differences have been set to zero at 1 January 2004 IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement will be applied prospectively from 1 January 2005 and as such the associated 2004 comparatives are presented under UK GAAP To measure certain development and production assets at the transition date to IFRS at fair value and use this fair value as their deemed cost In addition, as a first time adopter, the Group has early adopted IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources which is not mandatory as at 31 December 2005, the reporting date of the Groups first IFRS financial statements.
This Standard has been adopted with effect from 1 January 2004.
The Group initially published on its website www.
com, full details of its conversion to IFRS, on the 28th September 2005, coinciding with the release of the Groups Interim Report for 2005.
As a result of subsequent clarifications from the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC, the Group further revised its accounting policies, and updated its restatement of prior periods to reflect these new policies.
Once again, full details are available on the Groups website, on 28th March 2006, coinciding with the release of the Groups Preliminary Results for 2005.
The adjustments to the previously reported UK GAAP financial statements and the reconciliations to the IFRS financial statements are summarised below.
a Reconciliation from UK GAAP to IFRS of the Profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 2004 000 UK GAAP Pro t for the Financial Year 22,367 IFRS adjustments: 1 Share-based payments 115 2 Income taxes 694 3 Oil & gas expenditures 10,718 IFRS Pro t for the Financial Year 12,228 1 Share-based payments The Dana Petroleum 1999 Share Option Scheme is an equity settled share incentive scheme and under UK GAAP no adjustment was made to the financial statements when options were granted under this arrangement.
Two awards have been made under this scheme since 7 November 2002.
IFRS 2 requires such awards to be fair valued at the grant date using an option pricing model and amortised through the income statement over the 3 year vesting period of the relevant awards.
This has reduced profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 by 115,000, net of the corresponding deferred corporation tax adjustment.
Dana Petroleum plc 2005 Annual Report | 63 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 2 Income taxes PRT Under UK GAAP there is no definitive guidance on the accounting treatment for UK PRT.
Historically the Group has charged PRT due on chargeable field profits as a tax expense in the income statement.
Danas charge to PRT arises from its interest in the Victor and Claymore fields.
No deferred PRT was previously provided for under UK GAAP.
IAS 12 supports the treatment of recognising PRT as an income tax and hence deferred PRT should be accounted and provided for.
The effect of this revision is to align the charge to PRT with the anticipated life of field profitability.
This has no impact on the economics of the assets or the life of field PRT charge.
This has increased profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 by 694,000, net of the corresponding deferred corporation tax adjustment.
3 Oil & gas expenditures As stated in the introduction to this document, Dana has revisited its oil and gas expenditure accounting policies.
From the date of transition, development and production activity will now be accounted for under IAS 16 Property, Plant & Equipment, and Dana will now, apply its capitalisation, depletion and impairment policy primarily on an individual asset basis.
As a result, only exploration and appraisal activity will be accounted for under IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources.
Once deemed unsuccessful, exploration and appraisal activity will now be written off to the income statement in the period the relevant indicators occur.
As a consequence of this, Dana has updated its restatement of prior periods to reflect these changes to policy.
This has reduced profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 by 10,718,000, net of the corresponding deferred corporation tax adjustment: being the additional depletion charge for development and production activity for the year and the carrying value of the exploration licences, expiring during the year.
b Reconciliations from UK GAAP to IFRS of Shareholders Equity at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003 2004 2003 000 000 Shareholders Funds UK GAAP 187,753 156,421 Minority interest 1,696 1,407 Total Equity UK GAAP 189,449 157,828 IFRS adjustments: 1 Share-based payments 1,051 275 2 Income taxes 232 926 3 Oil & gas expenditures 32,443 21,725 Shareholders Funds IFRS 157,825 135,452 64 | Dana Petroleum plc 2005 Annual Report 1 Share-based payments The Dana Petroleum 1999 Share Option Scheme is an equity settled share incentive scheme and under UK GAAP no adjustment was made to the financial statements when options were granted under this arrangement.
IFRS 2 requires for such awards, that provision be made for any future share based pay out and for this to be presented within equity.
Under IFRS this is based on the fair value of all share-based awards at the grant date calculated using an option pricing model.
In addition, IFRS 2 requires that provision also be made for the deferred corporation tax adjustment arising on the intrinsic value of the option awards at the reporting date, and for this also to be represented in equity until the current tax adjustment arises.
The net increase to equity of these adjustments at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003 is 1,051,000 and 275,000 respectively.
2 Income taxes PRT Under UK GAAP there is no definitive guidance on the accounting treatment for UK PRT.
The cumulative impact on Shareholders funds at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003 is 232,000 and 926,000 respectively.
The cumulative impact on Shareholders funds at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003 is 32,443,000 and 21,725,000 respectively.
The 2004 movement is explained in section a 3 on page 64.
The 2003 movement relates to UK exploration activity previously written off to the UK development and production pool, under UK GAAP accounting: adjustments to the depreciation basis of certain development and producing assets: and due to other exploration activity in the former Rest of the World segment, where the new policy indicators of unsuccessful exploration, had occurred prior to this date.
Dana Petroleum plc 2005 Annual Report | 65 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued c Other Adjustments with a Presentation only Impact to the Balance Sheet at 31 December 2004 UK GAAP IAS 16 IFRS 6 Presentation IFRS 1 2004 Adjustment Adjustments 2004 Balance Sheet at 31 December 2004 000 000 000 000 Intangible assets 99,254 15,474 2,686 81,094 Property, plant & equipment 107,574 15,716 2,686 94,544 1 These are the adjustments to intangible assets and property, plant & equipment corresponding to the changes to the oil and gas expenditure policies detailed in Note 2.
The Presentation Adjustments also reflect the new oil and gas expenditure capitalisation policy detailed in Note 2, whereby the carrying value of E&E assets are reclassified as D&P assets following development sanction.
This adjustment reflects the status of the F16-E asset at the above dates.
d Reconciliation of Shareholders Equity at 1 January 2005 for impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39 000 Shareholders Funds IFRS at 31 December 2004 157,825 1 Available-for-sale financial assets 3,754 2 Embedded derivative 3,016 Shareholders Funds IFRS at 1 January 2005 164,595 The Group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement at the effective date of 1 January 2005.
IAS 39 covers the recognition, measurement and derecognition of financial instruments for which there is no UK equivalent standard.
The Group decided to take the exemption afforded by IFRS 1 which removed the requirement to produce 2004 comparatives.
The background to the above adjustments is as follows: 1 Available-for-sale Financial Assets Under UK GAAP, Group investments were included in the financial statements at cost less provision for diminution.
At 1 January 2005, Group investments comprise Dana Petroleums holding in Faroe Petroleum plc and the Groups interest in Evikhon, a Russian joint stock company.
The Group has reviewed its financial assets and liabilities and in compliance with IAS 32 & 39 has reclassified these investments as available-for-sale financial assets and restated these in the financial statements at fair value.
At 1 January 2005 fair value for the investment in Faroe Petroleum plc was based on that companys share price on the London AIM market at that date.
For Evikhon, fair value was taken as the value for which the investment was subsequently sold in March 2005.
These fair values are then adjusted for the associated deferred corporation tax adjustment.
At 1 January 2005, the aggregate effect of these adjustments was to increase equity by 3,754,000.
66 | Dana Petroleum plc 2005 Annual Report 2 Embedded Derivative Under UK GAAP there was no requirement to provide for the fair value of embedded derivatives.
The Group has reviewed its contracts and has identified an embedded derivative within the Victor Gas contract.
In compliance with IAS 39 the embedded derivative has been recognised at its fair value in the financial statements.
Fair value represents the discounted value of the anticipated future cash flows generated by the embedded derivative components, net of the corresponding deferred corporation tax adjustment.
The impact on equity from the introduction of this accounting policy is an increase of 3,016,000 net of the associated deferred corporation tax adjustment.
e Restatement of Cash Flow Statement from UK GAAP to IFRS The transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has no effect upon reported cash flows generated by the Group.
The IFRS cash flow statement is presented in a different format from that required under UK GAAP with cash flows split into three categories of activities operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
The reconciling items between the UK GAAP presentation and the IFRS presentation have no net impact on the cash flows generated.
In preparing the cash flow statement under IFRS, cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, highly liquid interest bearing deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
Under UK GAAP, such deposits were not classified as cash equivalents.
