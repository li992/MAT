Both valuations were in accordance with RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards.
The historic cost of the office premises is 292,000.
Existing use value assumes that demand existed for the premises for continuation of office use.
However, at the date of valuation, J & E Shepherd were of the opinion that such demand did not exist.
As such, the market value was materially different.
