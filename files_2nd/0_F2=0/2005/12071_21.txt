Equity-settled transactions On 29 April 2005 the Company introduced a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for senior employees including directors.
Under the scheme rules, participatory interests in ordinary shares are granted to eligible employees.
Unless varied by the Trustees of the scheme, 25% of the participatory interests in ordinary shares granted vest on award date with the balance vesting equally over the following three years, provided the recipients remain employees of the group.
The scheme rules also stipulate participatory interests in ordinary shares will vest immediately on the occurrence of certain events, including the admission of the Companys shares to the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange.
In the year to 31 December 2005, 53,000 participatory interests in US$1.00 ordinary shares were granted under the LTIP scheme rules.
The fair value of the interests granted, as determined using a net asset based formula, was US$897,000 or US$16.93 per US$1.00 ordinary share.
As a result of the Companys listing on the London Stock Exchange on 7 October 2005, as governed by the LTIP scheme rules, all then unvested awards of participatory interests in ordinary shares vested immediately.
Consequently, the group recognised a total expense of US$897,000 during the year in relation to these equity-settled transactions 2004: nil.
