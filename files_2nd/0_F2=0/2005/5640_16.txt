At 31 December 2005, the majority of Filtronas interest bearing loans and borrowings were at floating rates of interest set with reference to LIBOR for periods ranging from seven days to three months.
With effect from 24 February 2006, $35m and 30m of net debt was protected from adverse movements in interest rates with interest rate caps for a period of 21 months.
Also on 24 February 2006, the interest rate on $40m of net debt was effectively fixed at 5.1775% with interest rate swaps for a period of two years.
In 2004, the interest expense on former parent company financing was calculated at an interest rate reflecting the effective interest expense that Bunzl incurred during that year.

Employee benefits For the period prior to demerger Filtrona employees were members of the former parent companys defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The liabilities and assets of these schemes have been transferred to successor Filtrona schemes.
Liabilities were actuarially allocated between Filtrona and the former parent company and scheme assets were split in the same proportion as liabilities.
Under IAS 19 revised Filtrona has to account for defined benefit pension costs up to the date of demerger on a defined contribution basis and on a defined benefit basis thereafter.
Accordingly Filtrona has recognised the retirement benefit obligation of 34.7m at demerger in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
Trustees administer the schemes and the assets are held independently from Filtrona.
Pension costs of the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Full triennial actuarial valuations were carried out on the principal European defined benefit schemes in April 2003 and annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes.
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes have been updated to the balance sheet date from the most recent actuarial valuations taking account of the investment returns achieved by the schemes and the level of contributions.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice, local conditions and practices.
Defined benefit contributions in 2006 are expected to be 4.2m, which consists of payments to fund future service accruals and contributions to amortise the deficit in respect of past service.

UK and some overseas employees were also able to participate in Save As You Earn schemes or local equivalent run by the former parent company.

Acquisitions In December 2005 Filtrona purchased an additional 30% of FractureCode Corporation ApS FractureCode, taking Filtronas share in FractureCode to 80%.
FractureCode was previously accounted for as a joint venture using equity accounting.
Following the purchase it is now fully consolidated and contributed nil to operating profit before intangible amortisation in 2005.
The remaining 20% of shares in FractureCode could be acquired between March 2009 and December 2012.
The consideration for the remaining 20% of shares is dependent on various profit related targets and is capped at a maximum of 40m.
The principal acquisition made during 2004 was Skiffy, which Filtrona acquired in March.
The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and contributed 2.3m to operating profit before intangible amortisation in 2004.
On acquisition the assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired were adjusted to reflect their fair values to Filtrona.
The fair value adjustments are provisional and subject to finalisation for up to one year from the date of acquisition.
The principal fair value adjustments are as follows: In 2005: The adjustment to intangibles represents the write-off of goodwill in the entity on acquisition in accordance with IAS 38: Intangible Assets.
The adjustment to investment in associate and minority interest reflects the change from equity accounting to full consolidation.
In 2004: The adjustment to trade and other payables reflects their estimated settlement value.

Reconciliation to UK GAAP As stated in the accounting policies, these financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Apart from in the Listing Particulars dated 17 May 2005, Filtrona has never had to prepare consolidated financial statements under UK GAAP.
However, reconciliation of the consolidated balance sheets at 31 December 2004 and 1 January 2004 and the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004 that would have been presented under UK GAAP is given below for information purposes.

There are no other material differences between the statement of cash flows presented under IFRS and the statement of cash flows presented under UK GAAP.
Notes a Filtrona has applied IFRS to all business combinations that have occurred since 1 January 2004.
Under IFRS Filtrona valued certain other intangible assets acquired separately from goodwill.
As a result Filtrona recognised 21.1m as customer lists acquired in the year.
Additionally under IFRS goodwill is no longer amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Customer lists are being amortised over their useful economic lives.
Under IFRS Filtrona provided a 5.6m deferred tax liability in respect of customer lists acquired in the year.
This resulted in additional intangible assets being recognised on acquisition.
b Under IFRS Filtrona cannot present defined benefit retirement benefit obligations prior to the date of demerger since IAS 19 revised states that a contractual agreement between the sponsoring company and its participants on how the deficit is to be funded must exist.
This reduced retirement benefit obligations net of associated deferred tax assets by 19.6m 1 Jan 2004: 17.5m.
c Filtrona has to account for deferred tax on share option expense under IFRS and accordingly a deferred tax asset of 0.2m 1 Jan 2004: 0.3m was recognised.
Under UK GAAP tax was only recognised on the shares when they were exercised.
Under UK GAAP deferred tax is shown net on the consolidated balance sheet.
Under IFRS the assets and liabilities are required to be shown separately net of any allowable offsets and therefore 0.2m 1 Jan 2004: 0.3m was reclassified as deferred tax assets and liabilities.
d Under IFRS accruals cannot be made for dividends declared after the balance sheet date.
Hence dividends payable to minorities of 0.2m 1 Jan 2004: 0.2m made after the balance sheet date were adjusted.
e Under IFRS provisions were split between non-current and current liabilities.

Reconciliation to UK GAAP continued f The following is an analysis of differences relating to operating profit before intangible amortisation: 2004 Note m Non-recurring adjustments in Fibre Technologies Property impairment i 1.3 Asset impairment ii 1.0 Fair value adjustments related to prior year acquisitions ii 1.2 3.5 Non-recurring adjustment in Central Services Pension adjustment iii 1.5 Non-recurring IFRS adjustments 5.0 Recurring adjustment Share option expense iv 1.1 Total IFRS adjustments 6.1 Notes i Under UK GAAP Filtrona revalued downwards a property that had previously been revalued.
Under IFRS this property was held at deemed cost at 1 January 2004 and consequently the property has been impaired through the income statement ii Under UK GAAP Filtrona was permitted to take fair value adjustments to goodwill for up to the end of the following financial year from the date of the acquisition.
Under IFRS Filtrona is only permitted to do this for up to one year after the date of acquisition and consequently 2.2m was charged to the income statement iii The impact of accounting for pension costs on a defined contribution basis under IFRS is to increase the expense by 1.5m iv I FRS requires Filtrona to account for an expense for the fair value of options and other share-based incentives granted to employees g Under IFRS the expected return on pension scheme assets and interest on pension scheme liabilities are reversed since pension costs are not accounted for on a defined benefit basis.
h The principal differences in the income tax expense are the release of deferred tax liability in respect of the property impairment and relief for the increased pension cost.
i The effect of the above differences on retained earnings is as follows: 31 Dec 1 Jan 2004 2004 m m Reclassification of revaluation reserve 1.3 Reverse retirement benefit obligation net of associated deferred tax 19.6 17.5 Deferred tax on share options 0.2 0.3 Previously unprovided deferred tax on properties 1.0 1.9 Currency movements reclassified to translation reserve 1.6 20.4 17.2 j The effect of the non-recurring IFRS adjustments on operating profit before intangible amortisation and demerger expense is: 2005 2004 m m Operating profit 57.8 48.1 Non-recurring IFRS adjustments 0.1 5.0 57.7 53.1
