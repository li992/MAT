50 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Corporate restructuring During the period the Group carried out a corporate restructuring including the introduction of a new holding company, Hikma Pharma PLC, incorporated in Great Britain as a public limited company on 8 September 2005.
Hikma Pharma PLC changed its name to Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC on 19 September 2005 and on 31 October 2005 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC acquired the issued share capital of Hikma Pharma Limited, the former holding company, for the issue of shares to shareholders on the basis of four shares for every one share held in Hikma Pharma Limited.
Prior to 31 October 2005, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC had not commenced trading or made any profits or losses.
On 1 November 2005 the shares of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC were listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The corporate restructuring was accounted for using merger accounting principles.
The results of the Company and its subsidiaries have been presented on a pro forma basis for the years ended 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004 as the Directors believe this information is more meaningful to readers than information for the period from 8 September 2005 to 31 December 2005.
The Directors believe that this presentation is necessary to present a true and fair view of the results of the Company and its subsidiaries for the period.
The Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC consolidated statutory income statement and cash flow statement for the period from 8 September 2005, the date of incorporation, to 31 December 2005 is presented in Note 44, in order to comply with Section 226 of the Companies Act 1985.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLCs consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation to market of certain financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups previously published financial statements were also prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
These International Financial Reporting Standards have been subject to amendment and interpretation by the International Accounting Standards Board and the financial statements presented for the years ended 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2005 have been prepared in accordance with those revised standards.
Unless stated otherwise these policies are in accordance with the revised standards that have been applied throughout the year and prior years presented in this financial statements.
The currency used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements is the US Dollar as the majority of the Companys business is conducted in US Dollars $.
The significant accounting policies are set out below.
Restatement of prior year income statement comparatives The following restatements had no effect on the profit for the 2004 financial year or on the net assets of the Group at 31 December 2004.
For the year ended 31 December 2005, the Groups share of results of associates has been included within operating profit as the Directors consider these activities to be operational activities and the 2004 comparative has been restated.
Accordingly, management fees receivable from associates of $1,016,000 2004: $333,000 are included in other operating income.
In 2004 the management fees were included in other income.
Flotation costs totalling $425,000 incurred in 2004 were classified as general and administrative expenses.
Following flotation, the 2004 comparatives have been restated to reflect these costs as non operational.
The prior year comparatives for revenue, sales and marketing costs, and general and administrative expenses have been restated to reflect a change in accounting policy for Medicaid rebates and associated administrative charges paid to the wholesale customers of the Generics division.
The restatement has resulted in revenue, sales and marketing costs, and general and administrative expenses being decreased by $1,771,000, $1,334,000 and $437,000 respectively.
This restatement had no effect on operating profits for the period.
Significant accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC the Company and entities controlled by the Company together the Group.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of the associates in excess of the Groups interest in those associates are not recognised.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
52 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Intangible assets Intangible assets are valued at cost and reviewed at least annually for any impairment.
Any resulting impairment loss is recorded in the income statement under general and administrative expenses.
a Goodwill: Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
b Marketing rights: are amortised over their useful lives commencing in the year in which the rights first generate sales.
c Product files: product files are assigned indefinite useful lives which are reviewed for impairment at least annually: any impairment is recognised immediately in profit and loss and is not subsequently reversed.
d Purchased software: is amortised over three years.
Foreign currencies For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in US Dollars, which is the functional currency of the Group, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions in currencies other than local currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value and the related foreign exchange are recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such cumulative translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised in the income statement when goods or services are supplied or made available to external customers against orders received and when title and risk of loss passes to the customer.
Turnover represents net invoice value after the deduction of discounts and allowances given and accruals for estimated future rebates and returns.
The methodology and assumptions used to estimate rebates and returns are monitored and adjusted regularly in the light of contractual and historical information and past experience.
Value added tax and other sales taxes are excluded from revenue.
Significant accounting policies continued Charge backs The provision for charge backs is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue.
In the USA the Group sells its products directly to wholesale distributors, generic distributors, retail pharmacy chains and mail-order pharmacies.
The Group also sells its products indirectly to independent pharmacies, managed care organisations, hospitals, and Group purchasing organisations, collectively referred to as indirect customers.
The Group enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products.
The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which they purchase the products at agreed-upon prices.
The Group will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed-upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesalers invoice price.
This credit is called a charge back.
The provision for charge backs is based on historical sell-through levels by the Groups wholesale customers to the indirect customers, and estimated wholesaler inventory levels.
As sales are made to the large wholesale customers, the Group continually monitors the reserve for chargebacks and makes adjustments when it believes that actual charge backs may differ from estimated reserves.
Returns and rebates In certain countries and consistent with industry practice, the Group has a product return policy that allows selected customers to return the product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date, in exchange for a credit to be applied to future purchases.
The Group estimates its provision for returns and rebates based on historical experience, changes to business practices and credit terms.
While such experience has allowed for reasonable estimations in the past, history may not always be an accurate indicator of future returns.
The Group continually monitors the provisions for returns and rebates, and makes adjustments when it believes that actual product returns may differ from established reserves.
Generally, the reserve for returns and rebates increases as net sales increase.
Price adjustments Price adjustments, also known as shelf stock adjustments, are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling prices of the Groups products that customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of the price reduction.
Decreases in selling prices are discretionary decisions made by Group management to reflect competitive market conditions.
Amounts recorded for estimated shelf stock adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers, estimated declines in market prices and estimates of inventory held by customers.
The Group regularly monitors these and other factors and re-evaluates the reserve as additional information becomes available.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Dividend income Income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Leasing Leases are classified as capital leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the operating lease.
Assets held under capital leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a capital lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
54 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Government grants Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Research and development Research and development expenses are fully charged to the income statement, as the Group considers that the regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of its products generally mean that the recognition criteria in IAS 38 Intangible assets are not met.
Where, however the recognition criteria are met, intangible assets will be capitalised and amortised over their useful economic life.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Tax The Group provides for income tax according to the laws and regulations prevailing in the countries where the Group operates.
Furthermore, the Group computes and records deferred tax assets according to IAS 12 Income Taxes.
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statements because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Share-based payment transactions Employees including Directors of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
Significant accounting policies continued Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which the share-based payments are granted.
The fair value is determined using a binomial model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations further details are given in Note 36.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the market price of the shares of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the modification date.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for a cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment requires an expense to be recognised when the Group buys goods or services in exchange for share or rights over shares equity-settled transactions or in exchange for other equivalent assets.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment have been valued at cost of acquisition and are depreciated, except for land, on a straight-line basis at the following depreciation rates: Buildings 2% to 4% Vehicles 10% to 20% Machinery and equipment 5% to 20% Fixtures and equipment 8% to 33% Any additional costs that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are capitalised.
Financing costs associated with the construction of property, plant and equipment are not capitalised.
Property, plant and equipment which are financed by leases giving Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are capitalised at the lower of the fair value of leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease, and depreciated in the same manner as other property, plant and equipment over the shorter of the lease term or their useful life.
Whenever the recoverable amount of an asset is impaired, the carrying value is reduced to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss is taken to the income statement.
Projects under construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Purchased products are valued at acquisition cost and all other costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
Cost of own-manufactured products comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
In the balance sheets, inventory is primarily valued at standard cost, which approximates to historical cost determined on a moving average basis, and this value is used to determine the cost of sales in the income statement.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less all estimated costs of completion and all estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Provisions are made for inventories with net realisable value lower than cost or for slow moving inventory.
56 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to market risks from treasury operations.
The principal derivative instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost and then remeasured at subsequent reporting dates to fair value.
Hedging derivatives are classified on inception as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designed as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designed as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
Amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the income statement in line with the hedged forecast transaction.
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Investments Available for sale investments with quoted market prices are initially recognised at cost on acquisition and remeasured to their fair values at year-end.
Gains or losses on remeasurement to fair value are recognised in shareholders equity until the investments are sold, disposed of, or determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gains or loss relating to these investments previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement.
Available for sale financial assets without market prices and the fair value of which cannot be reliably measured are stated at cost, less a provision for any impairment loss, which is taken to the income statement.
The fair value of quoted financial assets represents the closing price in the financial markets at the date of the financial statements.
However, the fair value of unquoted financial assets, or those with no declared price are estimated by comparing the fair value of a similar financial instrument or through a discounted cash flow method.
Accounts receivable Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in profit or loss account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at fair value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Significant accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or income-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset income-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
New accounting policies and future requirements The following IFRS and IFRIC interpretation have been issued by the IASB and are likely to affect future annual reports.
IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures was issued in August 2005 and is required to be implemented by the Group from 1st January 2007.
This new standard incorporates the disclosure requirements of IAS 32, which it supersedes, and adds further quantitative and qualitative disclosures in relation to financial instruments.
IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease was issued in December 2004 and is required to be implemented by the Group from 1 January 2006.
The interpretation requires arrangements which may have the nature, but not the legal form, of a lease to be accounted for in accordance with IAS 17 Leases.
This interpretation is not expected to have a material impact on the Group.

70 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 29.
Financial policies for risk management and their objectives Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables and investments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and finance lease receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Market risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange and interest rates risk.
Management actively monitors these exposures to manage the volatility relating to these exposures by entering into a variety of derivatives financial instruments.
The Groups objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flow associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates.
It is the Group policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations.
Foreign exchange risk The Group uses the US Dollar as its reporting currency and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange movements primarily in European, Algerian and Japanese currencies.
Consequently it enters into various contracts, which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to hedge against the risk of movement in foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
Interest rate risk The Group manages its exposures to interest rate risks by changing the proportion of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt in its total debt portfolio.
To manage this mix, the Group may enter into interest rates swap agreements, in which it exchanges the periodic payments based on notional amounts and agreed upon fixed and variable interest rates.
Using the above-mentioned derivative financial instruments has not had a material impact on the Groups financial position at 31 December 2005 or the Groups results of operations for the year then ended.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities: The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value: Cash and cash equivalents approximates to the carrying amount.
Short-term loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Long-term loans approximates to the carrying amount in the case of floating rate bank loans and other loans.
Forward exchange contracts based on market prices and exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Receivables and payables approximates to the carrying amount.
Provisions approximates to the carrying amount.
Lease obligations approximates to the carrying value.
The fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities do not materially differ form their fair value.
Derivative financial instruments Currency derivatives The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows.
The Group is a party to a variety of foreign currency forward contracts and options in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
At the balance sheet date, total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed are as below: 2005 2004 $000s $000s Foreign exchange forward contracts Euro 414 Foreign exchange forward contracts Yen 300 Foreign exchange option contracts Euro 1,020 These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures.
At 31 December 2005 and 2004, the fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be $709,648 and $1,016,647 respectively.
The fair valuation of the currency derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedge resulted in a loss of $4,847 and a loss of $3,128 for the years ended 31 December 2005 and 2004 respectively that has been deferred in equity.
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
Contracts with original nominal values of $19.5 million as at 31 December 2004 increased to $28 million as at 31 December 2005 have fixed interest payments at rates ranging from 2.8% to 5.4% for periods up until 2012 and have floating interest receipts ranging from LIBOR to LIBOR plus 1.5%.
The fair value of swaps entered into by the Group is estimated at a favourable value of $208,310 and a favourable value of $121,892 as at 31 December 2005 and 2004 respectively.
These amounts are based on market values provided by the banks that originated the swaps and are based on equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Some of these interest rate swaps are designated as effective cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity totalling $126,333 and $32,386 for the years ended 31 December 2005 and 2004 respectively, and the remainder are designated as ineffective cash flow hedges of which the change in their fair value has been taken to earnings.
A gain of $171,483 and $81,328 for the years ended 31 December 2005 and 2004 respectively have been recognised in the income statement.

Contingent liabilities The Group was contingently liable for letters of guarantee and letters of credit totalling $11.1 million and $7.1 million as of 31 December 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The Group guaranteed 47.5% of a loan granted to its associate Al-Jazeera Pharmaceutical Industries by Saudi Industrial Development Fund SIDF for a total equivalent value of $11.2 million and $13.3 million for the years ended 31 December 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations, involving significant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets, gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
Disagreements with, and between, revenue authorities as to intra-Group transactions, in particular the price at which goods and services should be transferred between Group companies in different tax jurisdictions, can produce conflicting claims from revenue authorities as to the profits to be taxed in individual territories.
Resolution of such issues is ongoing.
In common with many other companies in the pharmaceutical industries the Group is subject to certain legal and product liability claims from time to time.
Whilst provisions have been made for probable losses that management deems to be reasonable or appropriate there are inherent uncertainties connected with these estimates.
The Group does not expect the resolution of uncertainties to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
