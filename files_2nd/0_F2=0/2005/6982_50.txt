Financial instruments disclosure for the year ended 31 December 2005 as required by FRS 25 Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risk arises in the normal course of the Company's business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge certain transaction exposures to foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Credit risk The credit risk on derivative financial instruments is very limited as the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by independent international credit rating companies.
Interest rate risk Hedging In line with the Group policy of ensuring that at least 50% of its exposure to changes in interest rates on fixed term borrowings is hedged, at 31 December 2005, the Company had entered into two interest rate cap and collar transactions.
The cap on both financial instruments is a US dollar LIBOR rate of 4.75% and the collars are 4.19% and 3.96% respectively.
Both instruments mature over the next five years consistent with the maturity of the related $250 million loan.
At 31 December 2005 the Group had interest rate hedges with a notional contract amount of $187,500,000 2004: $nil.
The Company classifies interest rate hedges as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value at 31 December 2005 was 864,000 2004: nil comprising a financial asset 864,000.
This amount was recognised as a non-trade receivable in other current assets.
Foreign currency risk The Company incurs foreign currency risk on intercompany transactions that are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The currency primarily giving rise to this risk is the US dollar.
From time to time the Company enters into forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
When financing material asset purchases or acquisitions the Group's policy is to create a natural hedge as far as possible in respect of any borrowings used for such purposes.
In respect of the American Cystoscope Makers Inc ACMI acquisition, the Company applied this policy by raising the loan facility in US dollars, being the principal currency of the assets acquired and the trade of ACMI.
