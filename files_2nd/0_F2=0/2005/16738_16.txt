NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 31 MARCH 2005 1.
Basis of Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Information The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 March 2005.
No separate profit and loss account is presented for Viridian Group PLC as permitted by Article 238 3 of the Companies Northern Ireland Order 1986.
Entities in which the Group held an interest on a long-term basis and which were jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement were treated as joint ventures.
In the Group accounts, joint ventures were accounted for using the gross equity method.
Entities, other than subsidiary undertakings or joint ventures, in which the Group had a participating interest and over whose operating and financial policies the Group exercised a significant influence were treated as associates.
In the Group accounts, associates were accounted for using the equity method.
As more fully explained in note 1 to the 1998 accounts, the conditions for merger accounting set out in FRS 6 Acquisitions and Mergers and schedule 4 A to the Companies Northern Ireland Order 1986 were not fully met in the Group reconstruction which led to the acquisition by the Company of NIE.
However the directors considered that if acquisition accounting had been applied, the Group accounts would have failed to show a true and fair view for the shareholders since they had a continuing interest in NIE before and after the reconstruction.
Accordingly merger accounting was applied.
No quantification has been given of this departure because to do so would be misleading.
Accounting Policies Accounting convention The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards except as indicated in note 1 above.
New accounting standards The accounts reflect the adoption of UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts UITF 38.
UITF 38 requires own shares held under trust to be deducted in arriving at shareholders funds.
Previously own shares held under trust were presented as fixed asset investments.
The impact of UITF 38 is to reduce the Groups opening reserves at 1 April 2003 by 1.0m.
The implementation of UITF 38 has no impact on the Groups previously reported profits.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation.
The charge for depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost, less residual value, of assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, except for infrastructure assets as referred to below.
The lives of each major class of depreciable asset are as follows: Infrastructure assets 40 years Depreciation is charged at 3% for 20 years followed by 2% for the remaining 20 years Generation assets Up to 30 years Non-operational buildings - freehold and long leasehold Up to 50 years Fixtures and equipment Up to 25 years Vehicles and mobile plant Up to 5 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
42 Notes to the Accounts Viridian Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004-2005 2.
Accounting Policies Continued Goodwill Goodwill may arise on the acquisition of subsidiary and associated undertakings, the trade and assets of a business, and interests in joint ventures.
It represents the excess of cost over fair value of the Groups share of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
In accordance with FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, such goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised by equal instalments against profit over its estimated useful economic life which usually does not exceed 20 years.
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is written off as incurred, except that software development expenditure incurred on specific projects is carried forward when its future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured.
Any expenditure carried forward is amortised by equal instalments against profit over its estimated useful economic life.
Investments Current asset investments are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward foreign currency contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or where appropriate at the forward contract rate.
The accounts of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising on the retranslation of opening net assets is taken directly to reserves.
All other translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign enterprises, which are taken directly to reserves.
Derivative instruments The Group uses forward exchange and commodity contracts and interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates.
A discussion of how the Group manages its financial risks is included in the Financial Review and details of the Groups financial instruments and the aggregate fair values at the balance sheet date of the hedging instruments described above are disclosed in note 31 to the accounts.
The Group accounts for its derivative instruments as follows: Forward exchange and commodity contracts Gains and losses under these contracts are offset in the profit and loss account in line with the transactions which they are hedging.
Where the contract is used to hedge a committed future transaction, it is not recognised until the transaction occurs.
If the underlying commitment does not occur and the instrument ceases to be a hedge, a gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.
The rates under such contracts are used to value the hedged asset or liability.
Interest rate swaps Amounts receivable or payable in respect of swap agreements are recognised as adjustments to net interest payable in the profit and loss account over the period of the agreement.
Where a swap and underlying debt are terminated together, the net gain or loss is included in net interest payable.
When swaps are terminated but the underlying debt is retained then any gain or loss is deferred and is amortised to net interest payable over the remaining term of the underlying debt.
Interest rate swaps are not reflected in the balance sheet at fair value.
Stocks and work in progress Stocks are valued at the lower of average purchase price and net realisable value.
Pension costs The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements.
Pension costs in respect of defined benefit arrangements are assessed by qualified actuaries and are charged to the profit and loss account so as to recognise the expected cost of benefits over members' working lives with the employer.
Pension costs in respect of defined contribution arrangements are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable.
Accounting Policies Continued Grants Grants received in respect of expenditure charged to the profit and loss account during the year are included in the profit and loss account.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided on timing differences arising from the different treatment for accounts and taxation purposes of transactions and events recognised in the accounts of the current year and previous years.
Deferred taxation is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is discounted using the post tax yields to maturity that could be obtained at the balance sheet date on government bonds with maturity dates similar to those of the deferred taxation assets and liabilities.
Deferred taxation is not provided in respect of gains arising from the sale or revaluation of fixed assets unless, by the balance sheet date, a binding commitment to sell the asset has been entered into and it is unlikely that any gain will be rolled over.
Deferred income Grants and customers' contributions received in respect of fixed assets are deferred and released to the profit and loss account by instalments over the expected useful lives of the related assets.
Support and maintenance revenue is deferred on invoicing and released to the profit and loss account over the term of the support and maintenance period.
Software licence revenue Revenue in respect of software licences is recognised where delivery is complete and there are no future elements to be delivered or there are no significant customisations which are essential to the functionality of the delivered element.
Where the software requires significant customisation over an extended period, licence revenue is recognised over the period of implementation on a percentage complete basis.
Long-term contract accounting Profit on long-term contracts is taken as the work is carried out if the outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
The profit included is calculated on a prudent basis to reflect the proportion of the work carried out at the period end, by recording turnover and related costs as contract activity progresses.
Turnover is calculated as that proportion of total contract value which costs incurred to date bear to total expected costs for that contract.
Revenues derived from variations on contracts are recognised only when they have been accepted by the customer.
Full provision is made for losses on all contracts in the year in which they are first foreseen.
Hire purchase and finance lease contracts Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group, and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over their useful lives.
The capital elements of future obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the profit and loss account over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Capitalised interest Interest on the funding attributable to significant capital projects is capitalised during the period of construction and written off as part of the total cost over the operational life of the asset.
All other interest payable and receivable is reflected in the profit and loss account as it arises.
Bid costs The Group expenses, when incurred, all bid costs and other related costs where recovery is not specifically provided for in accordance with the contract terms, except that directly attributed costs which can be separately identified and reliably measured are recognised as assets when it is virtually certain that a contract will be achieved and that contract is expected to generate future net cash inflows with a net present value at least equal to the amounts recognised as an asset.
Costs incurred before this level of certainty is obtained are not subsequently reinstated.
Decommissioning Provision is made where appropriate for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the producing lives of the Groups infrastructure and generation assets on a discounted basis.
Capitalised decommissioning costs are depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.
The unwinding of the discount is included within net interest payable.

Options may be exercised earlier than the normal date in special circumstances such as death or ceasing employment due to injury, redundancy, retirement or sale of the business.
During the year 53 participants exercised options in respect of 46,535 shares for a total consideration of 0.2m.
58 Notes to the Accounts Viridian Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004-2005 23.
No directors have been granted options since 5 July 1993.
Options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme are exercisable within a period of 10 years from the date of grant and entitle the participant to acquire ordinary shares in the Company at a price determined at the time options were granted by the Board.
The price of the option is not less than the higher of the nominal value of the share and the market value of a share on the dealing day immediately preceding or, if the Board so determines, the average market value over the three dealing days preceding the date of grant.
Options are normally only exercisable after three years from the date of grant by a participant who remains in the Group's employment.
Share Investment Plan SIP In February 2005, the Group established a SIP, which is independently administered and has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs.
The SIP gives employees an opportunity to purchase shares out of pre-tax salary up to a maximum value of 125 per month or 10% of taxable salary, whichever is lower.
The SIP also allows the Group to provide some matching shares to participating employees at no cost.
During 2005, 4,471 matching shares were purchased by the trustees of the SIP on behalf of 753 employees at a total cost to the Group of 33,000.

60 Notes to the Accounts Viridian Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004-2005 25.
Pension Commitments Most employees of the Group are members of the VGPS.
"This has three sections: ""Options"" which is a money purchase arrangement whereby the Group matches members contributions up to a maximum of 6% of salary, ""Focus"" which provides benefits based on pensionable salary at retirement or earlier exit from service and the Public Sector section, which provides final salary related benefits for certain employees who have joined from the public sector under outsourcing contracts."
In addition, there is a money purchase arrangement for employees in the RoI known as Choices: its benefits mirror those of the Options section of VGPS.
The assets of the schemes are held under trust and invested by the trustees on the advice of professional investment managers.
The pension cost for the year in respect of benefits under the schemes was 17.4m 2004 - 15.8m.
The Groups contributions to the schemes totalled 17.4m 2004 - 15.8m.
A prepayment of 8.9m is included in the balance sheet at 31 March 2005 2004 - 8.9m.
This represents the difference between the amounts funded and the amounts charged to the profit and loss account.
The net pension charge in respect of the Focus and Public Sector sections of VGPS is derived from a regular cost of 14.9% of salaries, increased by a variation charge of 7.7m, which represents the amortisation of the pension deficit over 15 years, the average remaining service life of employees as at 31 March 2003.
The pension cost has been determined in accordance with the advice of Hewitt, the schemes actuaries, based on the latest actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2003.
For accounting purposes, the projected unit method was adopted, and the most significant actuarial assumptions were that investment returns at 7.6% per annum pre-retirement would exceed general salary increases by 4.0% per annum and investment returns of 6.1% per annum postretirement would exceed future pension increases by 3.4% per annum.
The market value of the Focus and Public Sector sections assets as at 31 March 2003 was 593m.
The actuarial value of the assets represented 87% of the actuarial value of the accrued benefits.
The accrued benefits include all benefits for pensioners and other former members as well as benefits based on completed service and projected salaries for active members.
The Group is making contributions to make the deficit good over the remaining service life of the employees at the rates recommended by Hewitt.
FRS 17 disclosures Hewitt have provided a valuation of the Focus and Public Sector sections under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits as at 31 March 2005 using updated financial assumptions and market values from the 2003 actuarial valuation and the projected unit method.
The valuation shows a deficit before deferred tax of 168.6m 2004 - 168.6m.
The major assumptions used were in nominal terms : 2005 2004 2003 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.9% per annum 3.9% per annum 3.6% per annum Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.0% per annum 3.0% per annum 2.7% per annum Discount rate 5.3% per annum 5.5% per annum 5.4% per annum Inflation assumption 2.9% per annum 2.9% per annum 2.6% per annum Notes to the Accounts 61 25.

Pension Commitments Continued An analysis of the pension cost for the years ended 31 March 2005 and 31 March 2004 under FRS 17 is shown below.
In addition to maintaining the current level of contributions, it is proposed to make an additional contribution of 25m to the pension scheme during the financial year 2005 06.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities a Capital commitments Group 2005 2004 m m Contracted future capital expenditure 8.9 14.3 b Other contractual commitments NIE entered into power purchase agreements with generating companies in Northern Ireland in March 1992 to make payments for the availability of generating capacity as well as for the purchase of electricity generated.
The principal remaining contracts are with Premier Power Ltd Ballylumford and AES Kilroot Power Ltd Kilroot.
The Ballylumford contracts expire in 2012 but NIE has options to extend them by up to 10 years.
The Kilroot contracts expire in 2024 but NIAER has early contract cancellation rights that can be exercised from November 2010.
In December 2000 a number of the contracts at Ballylumford were renegotiated and in addition a contract buy-out CBO agreement was entered into to make payments to fund a buy-out of the profit element under the original agreements at Ballylumford.
The CBO agreement has provisions under which a termination amount becomes payable in certain circumstances.
The extent of the payment will depend on the date on which such a termination event arises.
NIE does not anticipate that any liability will arise and no provision has been made.
In July 2003 NIE agreed to sell 170MW of capacity to ESB in the RoI through the North-South interconnector which links the Northern Ireland and RoI electricity systems, having contracted to purchase this capacity from units no longer under long-term contract at Ballylumford.
NIE has also entered into the following agreements: i agreements to purchase output from renewable generators which were concluded under NFFO Orders and which expire between 2009 and 2013: and ii an agreement with Moyle Interconnector Limited which secures 125MW of capacity on the Moyle Interconnector until 2007 which facilitates the purchase of energy from GB to supply Northern Ireland customers.
In order to meet their wholesale and retail supply commitments, Viridian Energy Ltd and Viridian Energy Supply Ltd have entered into a portfolio of power purchase and capacity agreements which expire between 2005 and 2018.
64 Notes to the Accounts Viridian Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004-2005 27.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities Continued Letters of credit, performance bonds and guarantees Group companies have entered into letters of credit, performance bonds and guarantees totalling 70.4m 2004 - 39.7m in relation to the trading activities of NIE, Powerteam, VP&E and Sx3.
In addition, Group companies have guaranteed: i Viridian Energy Ltds obligations under its FPESA with Huntstown Power Company Ltd for a period of 15 years: ii 85% of Viridian Energy Supply Ltds obligations under a power purchase agreement with Altahullion Windfarm Ltd for a period of 15 years.
Since this guarantee has been given in respect of the purchase of future wind generated power, it is not possible to provide a reliable quantification of the amount of the guarantee: iii Viridian Power Ltds obligations to Mitsubishi Corporation under the Huntstown 2 EPC contract, which at 31 March 2005 amounted to 1m: and iv Viridian Energy Supply Ltds obligations under a power purchase agreement with Windfarm Developments Ltd.
Since this guarantee has been given in respect of the purchase of future wind generated power, it is not possible to provide a reliable quantification of the amount of the guarantee.
The Group does not anticipate that any liability will arise thereunder and no provision has been made.
The Company has entered into guarantees totalling 29.6m 2004 - 32.3m in relation to the trading activities of VP&E and a letter of credit for 7.1m 2004 - 3.3m in relation to the bank loan associated with Huntstown 1.
In addition, the Company has guaranteed the obligations referred to in i to iii above.
The Company does not anticipate that any liability will arise thereunder and no provision has been made.
c Contingent liabilities Protected Persons The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of obligations under the Electricity Protected Persons Pensions Regulations Northern Ireland 1992 for employees of NIE at privatisation.
This includes members employed in companies which have subsequently been disposed of by the Group.
The Group does not anticipate that any liability will arise other than that recognised in the accounts.
Power station sites NIE lease sites to power stations in Northern Ireland.
Under the terms of the lease agreements NIE may be required to pay compensation if a lease is terminated.
Since the extent of the compensation will depend on the circumstances which give rise to the termination it is not possible to identify the magnitude of any potential liability.
NIE does not anticipate that any liability for compensation will arise and no provision has been made.
Power station agreements Under the terms of the power station agreements between NIE and generators in Northern Ireland, where modifications to generating equipment are necessary and a generator is unable to procure the necessary financing, NIE must either provide such finance or pay the costs incurred by the generator in carrying out such modifications.
The costs incurred by NIE in meeting these obligations are recoverable under its Licence, but will require to be financed by NIE until such recovery is achieved.
NIE does not anticipate any modifications which require financing and no provision has been made.
Property clawback A clawback debenture was entered into in 1993 which entitled DETI to a proportion of any property gain above certain thresholds accruing or treated as accruing to the Company or any member of the Group as a result of disposals, or events treated as disposals deemed disposals, occurring after 31 March 1993 in relation to land and any buildings on that land in which NIE had an interest at 31 March 1993.
These arrangements lasted until 31 March 2003.
A provision for clawback in respect of property disposals would be made only to the extent that it is probable that a liability will crystallise.
Such a liability may crystallise when an actual or deemed disposal occurs.
NIE is in dispute with DETI in connection with valuations relating to the possibility of any clawback liability payable to DETI as a result of disposal by NIE of property at its Danesfort site and of some other retail properties.
The parties have agreed that the dispute should be determined by an independent expert under the terms of the clawback debenture.
