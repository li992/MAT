59 Liquidity risk The Groups objectives and policies in managing the liquidity risks that arise in connection with the use of financial instruments are set out in Note 54 under the heading Liquidity Risk Management.
For these instruments, which are mostly held by Barclays Capital, liquidity and repricing risk is managed through the Daily Value at 3.5 Risk DVaR methodology.
Retail deposits which are repayable on demand or at short notice form a stable base for the Groups operations and liquidity needs because of the broad base of customers numerically and by depositor type.
Financial assets designated at fair value held in respect of linked liabilities are managed with the associated liabilities.
