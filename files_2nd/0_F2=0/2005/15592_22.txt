4 Tesco PLC David Reid Chairman Chief Executives review This has been a successful year for Tesco and every bit of the Group has played its part.
We aim to The way we grow profits is by trying to make Tesco more attractive to customers, so that make everybody more people choose to shop with us.
We are doing well for one simple reason: globally, millions more customers have chosen Tesco with 10 million more visits a week to our welcome at Tesco, stores around the world.
wherever they In 1997, when we first presented our four-part strategy a strong UK business, non-food, live and whatever retailing services and international we were a UK grocer with a fledgling overseas operation.
com was still just a good idea and we had only recently announced our first move their income.
It was early days for three of the four parts of our stratergy.
Today, these new businesses have delivered more profit than the entire Group did in 1997.
We are now a truly international retailer, with growing strength in non-food and retailing services.
International The emergence of international retailing will take a long time.
This is, today, still a local industry.
Local influences hold sway over global economics.
The balance is slowly changing enough for me to believe that retailing will become a truly international industry.
Our ten years of experience has strengthened this belief.
I also believe Tesco can play a leading role.
In the last ten years we have begun the process.
We have gained vital experience learned what we are good at, developed capability, worked out a strategy and weve built a profitable, growing business along the way.
This strategy is built on six elements.
Firstly, be Flexible each unique market requires a slightly different approach: second, act Local local cultures, customers, supply chains and regulations are the norm: third, keep Focus to be the leading local brand is a long term effort, it is not about planting flags: fourth, operate Multi-formats no single format can reach the whole market: fifth, Capability success is not about scale, it is skill that counts and being able to share this around the business is vital: and finally, retailing is a Branded business developing the retail brands which will build the important lasting relationships with customers takes time.
We have had some competitive and economic challenges in international this year but remained focused on becoming a better business.
UK We aim to offer our customers the convenience of either large or small stores and the success of two of our recent acquisitions demonstrates the broad appeal of the Tesco brand.
Since we converted the ten former Safeway stores we purchased from Morrisons, sales have almost doubled.
All of these stores were there before, but 70,000 more customers are shopping there since they became Tesco stores.
Sales at the Cullens, Harts and Europa stores we bought in Central London have more than doubled.
We now have over 550 Express stores and over four million customers walk to their local Tesco every week this is neighbourhood shopping as it should be.
Our Value and Finest ranges, which both now have over 2,000 products, enable customers to shop within their own budgets.
Our Healthy Living, Free-From and Organic ranges allow customers to choose products to suit their lifestyles and we have improved the labelling on over 4,500 lines, providing better information to help them make that choice.
Terry Leahy Chief Executive Tesco PLC 5 Chief Executives review continued Success or failure in our industry depends on how good a job we did on a customers last shopping trip, so we invest in the things that really matter to them: We have put more staff into stores and distribution centres to improve availability and service.
Were working on keeping the aisles clear.
Our price cuts of 230 million this year, plus the 67 million more announced in April 2005 mean that the average weekly shop at Tesco costs less than it did a year ago.
Our Step Change programme helps fund all of this investment.
This year, we have saved over 270 million by making the business better, simpler and cheaper.
Non-food Like-for-like growth in our non-food business in the UK is still running at twice the rate of food sales.
UK non-food sales now amount to 6 billion, an increase of 17% on last year.
This growth is not coming from just one or two categories its broadly based.
Our home entertainment sales grew by 20%, the stationery, news and magazines category by 26% and health and beauty by 13%.
Our clothing growth is still very strong, at over 28%, and UK clothing sales were nearly 700 million, but we still have a long way to go.
Retailing services More than 1.2 million new customers this year have chosen one of our retailing services.
The number of weekly grocery orders on tesco.
com has increased to over 150,000 and service levels got even better.
During the year we added eDiets and Legal Store to the tesco.
com offer, as well as a significant expansion in the ranges of non-foods available online.
We try to bring simplicity and value to complex markets.
Customers with busy, stressful lives increasingly want simple choices which is one reason why one million customers have chosen Tesco Telecoms.
Tesco Personal Finance, which is now a substantial business making over 200 million a year, is about to sign up its five millionth customer with 60,000 new customers a month joining during the year.
In summary Tesco operates in competitive markets but we thrive on competition and we innovate.
We have created new opportunities for long-term growth and we are pursuing them with increasing confidence.
Our customers have told us what We had an exceptional year in the UK.
they expect from an Every Little Helps shopping trip and we know We are expecting a more normal year this year and are well from our staff what is important placed to handle the competitive challenges which lie ahead.
The Way We Work is how we deliver Every Little Helps to make Tesco a better place to shop and work in.
Terry Leahy Chief Executive 6 Tesco PLC Core UK D fide elliiv five er riin ng g f fo or r c cu us st to om me er rs s We aim to deliver clear aisles, good availability and prices, no queues and great service.
This has resulted in over two million new customers choosing to shop with us in the UK this year.
Kingston Extra Newcastle, UK Tesco PLC 7 Core UK living every In the UK, our team of over 250,000 people is committed to delivering an Every Little Helps shopping trip for our customers.
Focusing on our customers Over 9,000 customers have taken part in Customer Question Time sessions in the past 12 months, helping us to understand the things that really matter to them.
As a result we have introduced parking bays in new stores to keep the aisles clear of the trolleys we use when filling shelves.
We have put extra staff on checkouts and introduced over 250 more Grab n Go fresh food counters, and selfservice cafs to help customers in a hurry.
Clubcard just gets better and better Clubcard allows us to say thank you to over 11 million customers for shopping with us and we are always looking to find news ways to do this.
We introduced smaller Clubcards which can be attached to a keyring and have a bar-code because customers wanted a quicker and more convenient way of collecting their points.
We launched a Christmas Savers Club to allow customers to save their Clubcard vouchers to help with their Christmas shopping, and announced two new partners who now issue Clubcard points Avis and MFI.
We also simplified Clubcard Deals, so now all vouchers are worth up to four times their face value when used to buy Clubcard Deals.
For example, 25 in Clubcard vouchers gives a return ticket to Paris worth up to 100.
In our quarterly mailings this year, customers received 250 million in vouchers.
Know your stuff Show you care Share a smile Living Service All store staff are being given new skills to deliver even better customer service through a culture change programme called Living Service.
The three Living Service attitudes describe the way we behave when we deliver Every Little Helps in our stores.

We encourage our people to develop and at any one time there are over 25,000 staff working at Tesco while pursuing higher or further education.
We have training schemes for every career stage, offering everyone the opportunity to get on.
Managers in the UK can attend our Business Improvement Programme, while over 5,000 store staff this year took part in Options, our in-store management training The new bar-coded Clubcard key fob makes it easier to scheme.
We also became the first retailer to be accredited to award collect Clubcard points.
National Vocational Qualifications NVQs in Retail, and have created 480 apprenticeship positions so far.
Sharing in our success We offer a market-leading package of pay and benefits.
Our Shares in Success scheme rewards eligible staff for their hard work and commitment with free Tesco shares and our staff are benefiting from 169 million from Shares in Success and Save As You Earn schemes.
Our award-winning defined benefit pension scheme now has nearly 137,000 members which covers nearly 60% of staff.
This year, we have paid a cash contribution into the scheme of 200 million to strengthen its funding position.
Keeping close to our people To ensure we keep in touch with customers and staff, every year all of our distribution and head office managers spend a week working in a store through a scheme called TWIST Tesco Week In Store Together.
Retail and Logistics Director David Potts took on the day-to-day running of Romford store at Gallows Corner for a week.
Experience like this helps us to identify potential operating improvements that will simplify jobs and free up time for staff, so they can serve customers better.
Store managers across the company work at least one week out of every 12 on night shifts, to ensure that Every Little Helps is our focus for 24 hours a day.
Every Christmas and Easter, head office staff join their colleagues in stores to help serve customers during the busiest times of the year.
Retail and Logistics Director David Potts, at Romford store, Gallows Corner.
Tesco PLC 9 Core UK something Customers have different needs at different times so we tailor our stores as well as our products.
From Value to Finest and from Express to Extra, theres something for everyone at Tesco.
Express stores bring great food and great prices into the heart of local communities.
With 270 Express stores opening this year, bringing the total to nearly 550, even more customers are now benefiting from the convenience of having Tesco in their neighbourhood.
Twentysix of these stores are new sites, while we also continued with our conversion programme of Adminstore shops in London Cullens, Europa and Harts and of T&S.
Nearly six million transactions take place every week in our Express stores, with nearly two-thirds of customers visiting at least twice a week.
Our smallest Express store is opposite the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, serving over 15,000 customers each week.
Metro stores offer the convenience of Tesco in towns and city centres up and down the UK, bringing Tesco value and quality to the places where people work.
We opened six new Metro stores across the UK, bringing our total to 160.
Canterbury is one of our largest Metro stores, measuring 12,500 sq ft and we also opened a new 7,500 sq ft Metro inside the 100m Regent Quarter development in Kings Cross, London.
We refitted 17 stores during the year and plan to open a further four Metros in the current year.
Superstore At our Superstores, customers can find everything they need for their weekly shopping.
Within easy reach, our Superstores carry full food and convenience ranges together with our most popular non-food lines.
This year we opened 21 new Superstores, including the ten Safeway stores we purchased from Morrisons.
The introduction of our everyday low prices and broader ranges in the converted stores means more customers are experiencing the Tesco offer and sales have almost doubled.
We have also extended or replaced 14 Superstores this year.
Tesco Extra stores carry our widest range of non-food products along with extensive food and convenience ranges.
This destination shopping experience is proving very popular with customers, particularly at Christmas, when they can buy everything they need under one roof.
We opened six new Extras in the year and extended a further 11 Superstores to become Extras.
Our new store at Long Eaton was built on stilts, providing ample parking underneath as well as allowing us the space to offer customers extended ranges of food and non-food.
With less than 20% of the UK population having access to one of our 100 Extra stores, we expect to open a further 20 in the current year.
10 Tesco PLC Core UK for everyone Investing over 230 million in price cuts has meant that an average weekly shop at Tesco costs less than it did a year ago.
Customers love both our Value and Finest ranges.
In fact 77% choose to buy from both, perhaps saving money on Value bread and then splashing out on a bottle of Finest wine.
So we have expanded both, adding over 500 food lines this year alone.
We have also extended our Asian and Kosher ranges in response to customer demand.
For example, we have increased our Asian grocery lines by over 100 to 330 lines in 119 stores and introduced a new range of Kosher wines and ready meals.
Helping our customers stay healthy Healthy eating is high on our customers agenda, so this year we improved the labelling on nearly 5,000 products with additional information, to help customers make an informed choice.
We also introduced Glycaemic index Gi labelling and launched the Gi Guide, a lifestyle book to help customers follow this balanced eating plan.
Gi is a food ranking system which helps both people who want to control their weight and also those with diabetes.
A new low carbohydrate range is now in 400 stores, and we extended our Free-From gluten, milk or wheat free ranges to 150 lines, including our first Free-From Easter egg.

Treating our partners as we like to be treated As well as creating new jobs at Tesco, we try to help our suppliers to grow.
We provide them with access to an evolving and growing market, we pay them promptly and we share our understanding of customers with them.
Building on the constructive relationships Tesco has with its suppliers, we recently conducted an anonymous Supplier Viewpoint survey to understand what is good about working with Tesco and where we can improve.
The results were very positive and although they show we are not perfect, the majority of our suppliers think we are professional, committed to our customers, fair and consistent.
We are a founder member of the Ethical Trading Initiative which sets out standards for suppliers and are instrumental in the development and promotion of Sedex.
Sedex is a web-based system that strengthens supply chain auditing across the world and helps to reduce unnecessary duplication and costs.
This year we also trained our buyers on how to uphold labour standards in the supply chain.

Tesco PLC 33 Corporate responsibility making a Working with customers to help the environment In 2004 we introduced degradable carrier bags in many of our UK stores.
The degradable bags start to break down in as little as 60 days, if they are not recycled.
So far, our customers have used 719 million degradable bags saving 6,035 tonnes of non-degradable plastic.
In the last year we have recycled over 80% of our cardboard, paper and plastic.
With 90% of people saying they would recycle if it were easier to do so, Tesco is constantly looking for ways to help.
Over 450 of our stores offer customer recycling units.
We collected over 100,000 mobile phones and 174,000 inkjet cartridges for recycling, raising over 200,000 for charities.
We again linked up with the Woodland Trust to collect and recycle over 630 tonnes of Christmas cards.
We have launched a revolutionary new recycling unit at Winchester that automatically sorts plastic, metal and glass, making recycling even easier for our customers.
We believe it could triple the amount of waste that customers bring to stores for recycling.
Our mobile phone recycling scheme collected thousands In 1997 we made a commitment to reduce our energy consumption by of unwanted handsets 35% by 2006.
In early 2005 we achieved that aim.

Our staff in Thailand took people made homeless by the disaster into their own homes, while the Tesco clothing team distributed clothing and shoes to the region and to UK airports to help returning tourists.
We also arranged for essentials such as disinfectant, soap and toiletries to be shipped out to help prevent the spread of disease, while many store staff worked in Red Cross collection centres packing donated goods for distribution.
We are helping to rebuild the communities and economies shattered by the tsunami, for example, by funding the building of five fishing vessels in Sri Lanka and increasing our orders of tuna from the island.
