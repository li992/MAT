The words intend, aim, project, anticipate, estimate, plan, believes, expects, may, should, will, or similar expressions, commonly identify such forward looking statements.
Examples of forward looking statements in this Annual report include those regarding estimated reserves, anticipated production or construction commencement dates, costs, outputs, demand, growth opportunities and productive lives of assets or similar factors.
Forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors set forth in this document that are beyond the Groups control.
For example, future reserves will be based in part on long term price assumptions that may vary significantly from current levels.
These may materially affect the timing and feasibility of particular developments.
Other factors include the ability to produce and transport products profitably, demand for products, the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and operating costs, and activities by governmental authorities, such as changes in taxation or regulation, and political uncertainty.
In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, actual results could be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by these forward looking statements which speak only as at the date of this report.
Except as required by applicable regulations or by law, the Group does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.
The Group cannot guarantee that its forward looking statements will not differ materially from actual results.
