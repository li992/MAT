Notes i IAS 32 and IAS 39 result in a number of reclassifications between balance sheet categories.
For clarity, the reclassifications are shown in a separate column to the other IAS 32 and IAS 39 impacts which increase or decrease net assets.
ii IAS 39 requires that all derivatives are measured at fair value on the balance sheet, compared to cost under UK GAAP.
iii The EIR rules in IAS 39 require that discounts and incentives, and most fees and commissions receivable and payable, are spread over the average life of the loan.
Under UK GAAP, the Companys policy was to take these items to profit or loss as incurred, except for mortgage products where the customer had an obligation over a period of time to return the incentive if they redeemed the mortgage, and the early redemption fee was closely linked to the incentive cost.
The impact of the EIR rules is an increase in Loans and advances to customers of 157m.
There is a further increase of 21m, resulting from a reduction in impairment provisions under IAS 39, which require more observable evidence of impairment before a provision is made.
iv Debt securities have been reclassified to Investment Securities, split between Available-for-sale, Held-to-maturity, Loans and receivables and At fair value through profit or loss, and Trading securities.
v IAS 39 requires that Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value on the balance sheet, compared to cost under UK GAAP.
vi Held-to-maturity and Loans and receivables are accounted for under the IAS 39 EIR rules.
vii Certain investment securities have been designated by the Company as At fair value through profit or loss.
These securities are shown at fair value on the balance sheet, with subsequent changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
viii IAS 39 permits macro-hedging of financial assets and liabilities.
The resulting fair value adjustment to the underlying assets and liabilities is not allocated to individual assets and liabilities.
ix Under UK GAAP 23.3m of deferred mortgage incentives were included in prepayments and accrued income.
These are eliminated under IAS 39 as these incentives are accounted for as part of the EIR rules.
x The increase in amounts due to customers results from the requirement in IAS 39 to record financial liabilities at their contractual value.
xi Some debt securities in issue are fair value hedged, as permitted by IAS 39 and the Company has elected to designate some debt securities at fair value through profit or loss.
The movement reflects fair value adjustments.
xii Under UK GAAP income was being deferred on a swap transaction.
Under IFRS the income is recognised earlier and not deferred.
xiii The decrease in Deferred tax assets reflects the tax impacts arising from changes to assets and liabilities on adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 for the first time.
xiv The movement in Other borrowed funds reflects the retranslation of foreign currency subordinated loans and fair value hedging adjustments.
xv In accordance with IAS 32, this instrument has been reclassified within Minority interests.
xvi On adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, all movements in equity are posted directly to reserves.
The increase of 98.0m reflects the sum of the impacts to assets and liabilities at 1 January 2005.
50 Restatement of Consolidated Cash Flow Statement on adoption of IFRS The presentation of the cash flow statement as specified by IAS 7 differs from UK GAAP requirements.
A number of items have been reclassified, but there is no impact on cash flows.
There is no change to the level of Cash and cash equivalents at either the start or end of the year.
51 FRS 13 comparatives for 2004 Information on 2005 risk management is given in Notes 2 and 3.
Comparatives have not been disclosed for some of these disclosures made under IAS 32.
The information below is based on the UK GAAP requirements within FRS 13.
The figures differ from the 2004 balance sheet as they have been prepared under UK GAAP.
The information below compares the book and fair values of some of the Groups financial instruments by category at the balance sheet date.
Where available, market prices have been used to determine fair values.
Where market prices are not available, fair values have been calculated for options by using option-pricing models and for other financial instruments by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
Minor changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated fair values, and, as a result, readers of these financial statements are advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups financial position.
The concept of fair value assumes realisation of financial instruments by way of sale.
However, in many cases, the Group intends to realise assets through collection over time.

Thus it excludes mortgages, leases, personal loans and retail savings accounts whose book and fair values differ.
These figures represent accrued interest at the year end.
The Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: Interest rate risk using interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors, futures and forward rate agreements: Transactional currency exposures using spot and forward foreign exchange transactions.

The gains and losses do not therefore represent absolute gains or losses expected by the Group as they will be substantially offset by corresponding losses or gains from on-balance sheet instruments.
The following table provides a summary of the interest rate repricing profile of the Groups assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2004.
Assets and liabilities have been allocated to time bands by reference to the earlier of the next interest rate reset date and the contractual maturity date.
The table takes account of derivative financial interests whose effect is to alter the interest basis of Group assets and liabilities.
The trading book and non-interest bearing balances have been included in a separate column.

IAS 39 requires a different basis to UK GAAP for calculating impairment 5.
Reconciliation of IFRS Statutory Results to IFRS Proforma Results charges.
Within the reduction is 4m in respect of residential mortgages.

Effect of IFRS by the termination of the Groups offshore captive insurance subsidiary IAS 32 and Proforma Proforma which increased the charge by 8m.
Under IFRS the termination would not IAS 39 IAS 32 and Year Year ended IAS 39 ended have affected the charge.
This is partly offset by a general provision release 31.12.04 adjustments 31.12.04 of 4m under UK GAAP which would not have existed under IFRS.
The Notesmmm impairment charge for personal loans and current accounts is 10m lower, Interest receivable and and the charge for Wholesale Banking is 1m higher, under IFRS.

Interest receivable increased by 38m due to the IAS 39 Effective Interest Rate EIR rules, which require that interest discounts, cashbacks and fees should be recognised on a level yield basis over the loan life, through net interest income.
The main impacts are on residential mortgages and commercial loans.
The proforma results differ from those published in our restatement of results on an IFRS basis, issued on 27 May 2005.
Interest expense and similar charges has reduced by 14m, with an increase in profit attributable to minority interests of 14m see Note 7 below.
This change results from the change in accounting treatment for non-equity tier 1 as disclosed in our preclose statement on 2 December 2005.
In addition, interest receivable and interest payable have both been reduced by 64m due to a reclassification arising during the implementation of IFRS, with no overall impact on net interest income.
Interest payable also increased by 7m due to other IAS 39 adjustments.
Where fees charged on loans are integral to the loan yield, they are reclassified to net interest income, in accordance with the IAS 39 EIR rules.
Fees paid as a result of originating loans are reclassified from fees payable to net interest income, in accordance with the IAS 39 EIR rules.
The reduction in other operating income results from the requirement to record financial liabilities at their contractual value.
