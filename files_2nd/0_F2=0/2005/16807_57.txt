Under US GAAP, cash equivalents are dened as short term, highly liquid investments which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and were within three months of maturity when acquired.
At 31 March 2005, cash and cash equivalents under US GAAP included cash equivalents of 816 million 2004: 4,381 million: 2003: 291 million, which are classied as investments under UK GAAP.

The differences that are material to the Group relate to the following: Change in presentation In previous years, the deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax income allocable to partnership entities as determined for US income tax purposes resulting from adjustments to US GAAP were included in the line item Investments accounted for under the equity method.
The Group now shows these deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax income within the line item Income taxes.
Amounts within the reconciliations of net loss for the years ended 31 March 2004 and 2003 and shareholders equity as at 31 March 2004 have been reclassied to provide comparability with the presentation as at 31 March 2005 and for the year then ended.
This reclassication does not have an effect on net loss or shareholders equity under US GAAP.
a Investments accounted for under the equity method This line item includes the US GAAP adjustments affecting net loss and shareholders equity discussed in b through g and j below related to investments accounted for under the equity method.
Additional classication and presentational items not affecting net loss or shareholders equity are discussed below.
Under UK GAAP, amounts for exceptional non-operating items, interest, taxation and minority interest for joint ventures and associated undertakings are aggregated within the respective total Group amounts shown on the face of the consolidated profit and loss account.
Under US GAAP, all of these items are included in the Groups share in the net income or loss of these entities and is shown as a single line in the profit and loss account.

Following the prospective adoption of EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables on 1 October 2003 under US GAAP the Groups UK and US GAAP accounting policies have been substantially aligned.
For transactions prior to 1 October 2003, connection revenue under US GAAP are recognised over the period that a customer is expected to remain connected to a network.
Connection costs directly attributable to the income deferred are recognised over the same period.
Where connection costs exceed connection revenue, the excess costs were charged in the profit and loss account immediately upon connection.
The balances of deferred revenue and deferred charges as of 30 September 2003 will continue to be recognised over the period that a customer is expected to remain connected to a network.
Financials | 129 793529 2030 3 6 05 10:42 Page 130 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 36.
US GAAP information continued c Goodwill and other intangible assets Under UK GAAP, FRS 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, requires goodwill to be capitalised and amortised over its estimated useful economic life.
Prior to the prospective adoption of FRS 10 on 1 April 1999 the Group offset acquired goodwill against shareholders equity in the year of acquisition.
Under UK GAAP, licences and customer bases are not recognised separately from goodwill because they do not meet the recognition criteria.
Under US GAAP goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are capitalised and not amortised, but tested for impairment, at least annually, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Intangible assets with nite lives are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives.
The Group has assigned amounts to licences and customer bases as they meet the criteria for recognition apart from goodwill.
In determining the value of licences purchased in business combinations prior to adoption of EITF Topic D-108, Use of the Residual Method to Value Acquired Assets Other Than Goodwill, on 29 September 2004, the Group allocated the surplus of the purchase price, over the fair value attributed to the share of net assets acquired, to licences.
This was on the basis the nature of the licences and the related goodwill acquired in business combinations was fundamentally indistinguishable.
As a result of the adoption of EITF Topic D-108 as detailed in h below, for business combinations subsequent to 28 September 2004, the Group assigns amounts to licences based on a direct valuation of the licence.
Any residual purchase price is then assigned to goodwill.
When testing the recoverability of licences with indefinite lives, the Group adopted a direct valuation methodology on 1 January 2005.
Previously, the Group had used a residual method similar to that used in the initial allocation of amounts to licences in business combinations prior to 29 September 2004.
As discussed in g below, deferred tax liabilities are recognized on the difference between the US GAAP carrying value of the intangible assets recognised in business combinations and their respective tax basis.
Although this does not affect net assets on the date of acquisition, this results in a signicantly larger residual amount being allocated to intangible assets with an offsetting entry to deferred tax liabilities.
Under UK GAAP and US GAAP, the purchase price of a transaction accounted for as an acquisition is based on the fair value of the consideration.
In the case of share consideration, under UK GAAP the fair value of such consideration is based on the share price at completion of the acquisition or the date when the transaction becomes unconditional.
Under US GAAP, the fair value of the share consideration is based on the average share price over a reasonable period of time before and after the proposed acquisition is agreed to and announced.
This has resulted in a difference in the fair value of the consideration for certain acquisitions and consequently in the amount of goodwill capitalised under UK GAAP and US GAAP.
Under UK GAAP, costs incurred in reorganising acquired businesses are charged to the profit and loss account as post-acquisition expenses.
Under US GAAP, certain of such costs are considered in the allocation of purchase consideration.
Acquisitions As described further in note 25, the Group has undertaken a number of transactions in the year ended 31 March 2005, including stake increases in Vodafone Japan and Vodafone Hungary.
Under US GAAP, these transactions have resulted in the Group assigning 2,938 million to intangible assets, including 2,260 million to cellular licences, 655 million to customer bases and 23 million to goodwill.
A corresponding deferred tax liability of 1,182 million was recognised.
All intangible assets acquired other than goodwill are deemed to be of nite life, with a weighted average amortisation period of 17 years, comprising licences of 21 years and customer bases of 5 years.

The estimated future amortisation charge on nite-lived intangible assets for each of the next five years is set out in the following table.
The estimate is based on nite-lived intangible assets recognised at 31 March 2005 using foreign exchange rates on that date.
It is likely that future amortisation charges will vary from the gures below, as the estimate does not include the impact of any future investments, disposals, capital expenditures or uctuations in foreign exchange rates.

Under US GAAP, the interest costs of nancing the construction of network assets and other xed assets is capitalised during the period of construction until the date that the asset is placed in service.
Interest costs of nancing the acquisition of licences are also capitalised until the date that the related network service is launched.
Capitalised interest costs are amortised over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
During the year ended 31 March 2005, 31 million 2004: 429 million: 2003: 408 million of interest has been capitalised.
e Licence fee amortisation Under UK GAAP, the Group has adopted a policy of amortising licence fees in proportion to the capacity of the network during the start up period and then on a straight line basis.
Under US GAAP, licence fees are amortised on a straight line basis from the date that operations commence over their estimated useful economic lives.
f Exceptional items In the year ended 31 March 2005, the Group recorded an impairment charge under UK GAAP of 315 million in relation to the xed assets of Vodafone Sweden.
Under US GAAP, the Group evaluated the recoverability of these assets in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No.
144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, and determined that the carrying amount of these assets was recoverable.
As a result, the UK GAAP impairment charge of 315 million was not recognised under US GAAP.
The reversal of this impairment was partially offset by the incremental loss on the disposal of 16.9% of Vodafone Egypt under US GAAP which arose primarily due to the reclassication of currency losses from other comprehensive income to net loss.
The results of operations of Japan Telecom, which was deconsolidated from 1 October 2003, are reported as discontinued operations under US GAAP and are included in the segment Other operations Asia Pacic.
The pre-tax loss, including the loss on sale, was 515 million for the year ended 31 March 2004 2003: income of 133 million.
An incremental loss on disposal of 476 million 351 million net of minority interests was recognised under US GAAP resulting in a total loss on sale of 555 million 399 million net of minority interests.
In the year ended 31 March 2003, the Group recorded an impairment charge under UK GAAP of 405 million in relation to the xed assets of Japan Telecom.
Under US GAAP, the Group evaluated the recoverability of these xed assets in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No.
144 and determined that the carrying amount of these assets was recoverable.
As a result, the UK GAAP impairment charge of 405 million 270 million net of minority interests was not recognised under US GAAP during the year ended 31 March 2003.
In addition, the exceptional non-operating items recorded under UK GAAP, disclosed in note 6, are reclassied as operating items under US GAAP.
g Income taxes Under UK GAAP, deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Under US GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided in full on all temporary differences and a valuation adjustment is established in respect of those deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion will not be realised.
The most significant component of the income tax adjustment is due to the temporary difference between the assigned values and tax values of intangible assets acquired in a business combination, which results in the recognition of deferred tax liabilities under US GAAP.
Under UK GAAP, no such deferred tax liabilities are recognised.
Financials | 131 793529 2030 3 6 05 10:42 Page 132 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 36.
US GAAP information continued Under UK GAAP, deferred tax assets are recognised for future deductions and utilisations of tax carry-forwards to the extent that it is more likely than not that suitable taxable profit is expected to be available.
While the effects on the net deferred assets are the same, under US GAAP, the deferred tax assets are recognised at their full amounts and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that suitable taxable profits will not be available.
The valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets at 31 March 2005 was 10,413 million 2004: 11,150 million, the movement in the year being 737 million 2004: 296 million.
The valuation allowance is mainly in respect of tax losses amounting to 10,413 million 2004: 11,018 million not recognised.
In respect of Verizon Wireless, the line Investments accounted for under the equity method includes the Groups share of pre-tax partnership income and the Groups share of the post-tax income attributable to corporate entities as determined for US corporate income tax purposes held by the partnership.
The tax attributable to the Groups share of allocable partnership income is included as part of Income taxes in the reconciliations of net loss and shareholders equity.
This treatment reects the fact that tax on allocable partnership income is, for US corporate income tax purposes, a liability of the partners and not the partnership.
The Group has not provided certain deferred tax liabilities related to the outside basis differences of its foreign subsidiaries and foreign joint ventures under Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No.
23, Accounting for Income Taxes Special Areas, because it is the Groups policy to permanently reinvest such earnings giving rise to such basis differences and such differences are permanent in duration.
Quantifying the amount of undistributed earnings and deferred tax liabilities associated with those earnings is not practicable.
FASB Staff Position FSP No.
109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, provides guidance under FASB Statement No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the JOBS Act on a companys income tax expense and deferred tax liability balances.
The JOBS Act was enacted on 22 October 2004.
109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the JOBS Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying FAS Statement No.
Vodafone has determined that the benets obtained from these provisions are immaterial to the financial statements at 31 March 2005. h Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles EITF Topic D-108 On 29 September 2004, the SEC Staff announced new guidance on the interpretation of SFAS No.
142 in relation to the valuation of intangibles assets in business combinations and impairment testing.
This guidance has been codified as EITF Topic D-108.
Historically, the Group assigned to mobile licences the residual purchase price in business combinations in excess of the fair values of all assets and liabilities acquired other than mobile licences and goodwill.
This approach was on the basis that mobile licences were indistinguishable from goodwill.
The new SEC guidance requires the Group to distinguish between mobile licences and goodwill.
However, the new guidance does not permit the amount historically reported as mobile licences to be subsequently reallocated between mobile licences and goodwill.
The new guidance will affect the allocation of the purchase price in future business combinations involving entities with mobile licences.
The Group has applied the guidance relating to the allocation of purchase price to all business combinations consummated subsequent to 29 September 2004.
This has resulted in values being assigned to licences using direct valuation method with any remaining residual purchase price allocated to goodwill.
In impairment testing of mobile licences held by Verizon Wireless under SFAS No.
142, the Group has used a similar residual approach to determine the fair value of the licences when testing the asset for recoverability.
In their announcement, the SEC Staff stated that the residual method of accounting for intangible assets should no longer be used and that companies should perform an impairment test using a direct method on all assets which were previously tested using a residual method.
The Groups licences in other business are not tested for recoverability using a residual method and are, therefore, not affected by the new guidance.
The Group completed its transitional impairment test of Verizon Wireless mobile licences as of 1 January 2005.
This resulted in a pre-tax charge of 11,416 million.
This impairment is included, net of the related tax of 5,239 million, in the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the reconciliation of net loss.
The tax effect comprises the release of 1,220 million representing the Groups share of Verizon Wireless deferred tax liabilities and 4,019 million deferred tax liabilities representing taxes recognised by the Group on its investment in Verizon Wireless.
Fair value was determined as the present value of estimated future net cash ows allocable to the mobile licences.
Verizon Wireless is in the segment Mobile telecommunications Americas.
Accounting for post employment benets During the second half of the year ended 31 March 2005, the Group amended its policy for accounting for actuarial gains and losses arising from its pension obligations effective 1 April 2004.
Until 31 March 2004, the Group used a corridor approach under SFAS No.
87, Employers Accounting for Pensions in which actuarial gains and losses were deferred and amortised over the expected remaining service period of the employees.
The Group now recognises these gains and losses through the profit and loss in the period in which they arise as the new policy more faithfully represents the Groups financial position and will more fully align the Groups US GAAP policy to its IFRS policy of immediate recognition of these items.
The pro forma amounts in the reconciliation of net loss have been adjusted for the effect of retroactive application of the immediate recognition of actuarial gains and losses less related tax effects.
Other adjustments, such as to employee director compensation or interest expense, are not included as these would not have been affected had the new policy been applied in previous years.
The cumulative effect on periods prior to adoption of 288 million has been shown, net of tax of 93 million, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the reconciliation of net loss for the year ended 31 March 2005.
The effect of the change in the year ended 31 March 2005 was to increase loss from continuing operations by 55 million or 0.08 pence per share.
The effect of the change on the six months ended 30 September 2004 was to increase loss from continuing operations by 31 million or 0.05 pence per share.

Under US GAAP, dividends are included in the financial statements when declared by the Board.
j Other Marketable securities Under US GAAP, the Group classies its marketable equity securities with readily determinable fair values as available for sale and are stated at fair value with the unrealised loss or gain, net of deferred taxes, reported in comprehensive income.
Under UK GAAP, such investments are generally carried at cost and reviewed for other than temporary impairment.
The Groups xed asset investments, comprising mainly of equity securities, are classied as available for sale.
The table below sets out the information of the cost, fair value and unrealised gains and losses.

Minority interests Where losses in a subsidiary undertaking attributable to the minority interest result in its interest being one in net liabilities, UK GAAP requires a parent company make provision only to the extent it has a commercial or legal obligation to provide funding that may not be recoverable in respect of the accumulated losses attributable to the minority interest.
US GAAP requires all losses allocable to minority interests in excess of their interest in the equity of the respective subsidiary to be charged to the majority shareholder.
Derivative instruments All the Groups transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken for risk management purposes only and are used to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk.
In accordance with UK GAAP, to the extent that such instruments are matched against an underlying asset or liability, they are accounted for as hedging transactions and recorded at appropriate historical amounts, with fair value information disclosed in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Under US GAAP, in accordance with SFAS No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the Groups derivative financial instruments, together with any separately identied embedded derivatives, are reported as assets or liabilities on the Groups balance sheet at fair value.
In a hedge of fair values, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in earnings with a corresponding change in the fair value of the hedged item also being recorded in earnings.
For hedges of future cash ows, the changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassied to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings.
Under US GAAP, all changes in fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are accounted for in the consolidated profit and loss account.
The Group does not pursue hedge accounting treatment for: interest rate futures, which are typically used to switch oating interest rates to xed interest rates: derivatives entered into for funding and liquidity purposes, including forwards: or individual contracts where the underlying value of the transactions amounts to less than 10 million.
The net effect recognised in earnings representing hedge ineffectiveness for fair value hedges and cash ow hedges is not material.
Post employment benets Under both UK GAAP and US GAAP, pension costs provide for future pension liabilities.
There are differences, however, in the prescribed methods of valuation, which give rise to GAAP adjustments to the pension cost and the pension prepayment liability.
As at 31 March 2005, the Group operated a number of pension plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
A description of the Groups major pension plans is provided in note 32.
The investment policy and strategy of the UK main scheme in the UK is set by the Trustees and reects the liabilities of the plan.
The investment policy and strategy of the German plans are set by the Investment Sub-Committee of the Contractual Trust Agreement and similarly reects the liabilities of the plans, which are more heavily weighted towards pensioners than the UK plan.
The basis used to determine the overall long term return on plan assets is to apply the expected rate of return on bonds based on market interest rates at the relevant date to that proportion of the assets invested in bonds.
The bond rate of return is then increased by an allowance for the expected equity risk premium in each market, based on past experience and future expectations of return and this rate is applied to the relevant proportion invested in equities.
The measurement date for the Groups pension assets and obligations is 31 March.
The measurement date for the Groups net periodic pension cost is 1 April.
From 1 April 2004, actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the period in which they arise.
Analyses of the net pension cost, plan assets, obligations and funded status for the major dened benefit plans in the UK, Germany and Japan, prepared under US GAAP, are provided in the following table.

Under UK GAAP, options granted over the Companys ordinary shares are accounted for using the intrinsic value method, with the difference between the fair value of shares and the exercise price charged to the profit and loss over the period until the shares first vest.
Grants under the Groups Sharesave Scheme are exempt from this accounting methodology.
Under US GAAP, the Group accounts for option plans in accordance with the requirements of APB No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS No.
148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure.
25, such plans are accounted for as variable plans and the cost is calculated by reference to the market price of the shares at the measurement date, which is usually the date the shares vest, and amortised over the period until the shares vest.
Where the measurement date has not yet been reached, the cost is calculated by reference to the market price of the relevant shares at the end of each accounting period.
Had compensation cost been determined based upon the fair value of the share options and ADS options at grant date, the Groups net loss and loss per share would have been restated to the pro forma amounts indicated below in millions, except per share amounts : 2005 2004 2003 m m m Net loss as reported under US GAAP 13,782 8,127 9,055 Share-based employee compensation expense, net of related tax effects, included in the determination of net income as reported 198 129 48 Share-based employee compensation expense, under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax effects 168 107 65 Pro forma net loss 13,752 8,105 9,072 Loss per share Basic and diluted as reported under US GAAP 20.82 p 11.93 p 13.29 p Basic and diluted pro forma 20.77 p 11.90 p 13.31 p Financials | 135
