RECONCILIATION OF MOVEMENTS IN SHAREHOLDERS FUNDS YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2005 restated 2005 2004 m m Profit loss for the financial year 11.2 15.0 Dividends 15.6 9.8 4.4 24.8 Disposal of own shares in share trusts 0.3 0.8 Net addition to shareholders funds 4.1 24.0 Opening shareholders funds 147.8 171.8 Adoption of FRS26 on 1 January 2005 0.4 - Closing shareholders funds 144.1 147.8 Restated on adoption of FRS21 - see note 1 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY 1 Accounting policies a Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards using the historical cost convention.
b Deferred taxation Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all timing differences which have arisen but have not reversed at the balance sheet date, except as follows: i tax payable on the future remittance of the past earnings of subsidiaries is provided only to the extent that dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute all past earnings exists: ii deferred tax is not recognised on the difference between book values and fair values of non-monetary assets arising on acquisitions unless there is a binding agreement to sell such an asset and the gain or loss expected to arise has been recognised: and iii deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured on a non discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
c Financial instruments The company holds derivative financial instruments to hedge currency and interest risks arising from its activities.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at cost, if any, and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
Any gain or loss on remeasurement is recognised in the income statement.
However, the treatment of gains or losses arising from derivatives which qualify for hedge accounting depends on the nature of the hedged item itself.
The fair value of derivatives is the estimated amount receivable or payable to terminate the contract determined by reference to the market prices prevailing at the balance sheet date.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the company has swapped its fixed rate USD liabilities into floating rate GBP liabilities by utilising cross currency interest rate swaps.
The fair value of these swaps at 1 January 2005 results in a liability and consequent charge to profit and loss 6.9m.
The fair value of the liabilities hedged by these derivatives results in a decrease in the balance sheet carrying value and consequently a credit to profit and loss of 7.3m.
As permitted by FRS 26 Financial Instruments : Measurement these policies were adopted on 1 January 2005.
84 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY CONTINUED 1 Accounting policies continued Comparative amounts for derivative financial instruments are stated under the previous accounting policy under UK GAAP under which amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate derivatives are recognised on an accruals basis over the life of the instrument.
Fair value hedges Where a derivative financial instrument hedges the changes in fair value of recognised assets or liabilities, any gain or loss is recognised in profit and loss.
The hedged item is also stated, separately from the derivative, at fair value in respect of the risk being hedged with any gain or loss also recognised in profit and loss.
This will result in variations in the balance sheet values of the gross debt and the offsetting derivatives as the market value fluctuates.
d Investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any impairment losses.
e Employee benefits - share based payments The company operates a number of employee share option schemes.
The fair value at the date at which the share options are granted is recognised in profit and loss on a straight line basis over the vesting period, taking into account the number of options that are expected to vest.
The number of options that are expected to become exercisable is reviewed at each balance sheet date and if necessary estimates are revised.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20, no profit and loss expenses are recorded in respect of grants of share options made prior to 7 November 2002. f Cash flow statement As the ultimate holding company of the Pendragon group, the company has relied upon the exemption in FRS 1 revised and has not included a cash flow statement as part of its own financial statements.
g Pensions The company participates in a group wide pension scheme providing benefits based on both final pensionable pay and defined contributions.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the company.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the company.
The company has fully adopted the requirements of FRS 17 Retirement benefits.
h Related parties Under FRS 8 the company has relied upon the exemption not to disclose related party transactions with other group undertakings as they are all included in the Pendragon PLC consolidated financial statements.
i Dividends The company adopted the provisions of FRS 21 'Events after the balance sheet date' during the year by which final dividends proposed by the Board and unpaid at the end of the year are not recognised in the financial statements until they have been approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
This represents a change in policy from that of recognising dividends in the year for which they are proposed.
The previously published figures at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2004 have been restated.
This has resulted in the dividend balance being reduced by 4.7m and 7.4m respectively with a corresponding decrease in creditors less than one year.
These changes have resulted in shareholders funds increasing from 167.1m to 171.8m and 147.8m to 155.2m respectively.
j Own shares held by ESOP trust Transactions of the group-sponsored ESOP trust are included in the company financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the company are debited directly to equity.
2 Profit and loss account of the company In accordance with the exemption allowed by Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the company is not presented.
The profit after taxation attributable to the company dealt with in its own accounts for the year ended 31 December 2005 is 11.2m 2004 : loss 15.0m.
