38 Rotork Notes to the Group Financial Statements Annual Report 2005 for the year ended 31 December 2005 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2005 Except where indicated, values in these notes are in 000 Rotork p. l. c. is a Company domiciled in England.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2005 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The accounting policies contained below in note 1 and the disclosure in notes 2 to 28 all relate to the Group statements.
The Company balance sheet can be found following note 28.
As the Company has elected to continue reporting under UK GAAP, the applicable accounting policies are contained in note 29 and notes 30 to 40 relate to the Companys financial statements.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Group is preparing its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and its interpretation issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that have been adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS for the first time and consequently has applied IFRS 1.
An explanation of how the transition to Adopted IFRSs has affected the reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Group is provided in note 28.
In addition to exempting companies from the requirement to restate comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39 which the Group has taken, IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRSs on transition.
The following exemptions have been taken by the Group in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005: Business combinations Business combinations that took place prior to 1 January 2004 have not been restated.
Fair value or revaluation as deemed cost At the date of transition, fair value has been used as deemed cost for properties previously measured at fair value.
Employee benefits All cumulative actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit plans have been recognised in equity at 1 January 2004.
Cumulative translation differences Cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations have been set to zero at 1 January 2004.
In preparing the 2004 and 2005 financial information within its consolidated financial statements under Adopted IFRS, the directors have elected to adopt the endorsed December 2004 amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits and the April 2005 endorsed amendment to IAS 39 Cash Flow Hedge Accounting of Intragroup Forecast Transactions before they were endorsed by the EU.
Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention subject to the items referred to in the derivative financial instruments note below.
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 for the purposes of transition to IFRS and for preparing the 2004 and 2005 financial information within its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 with the exception of IAS 32 and IAS 39 as discussed below.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently in respect of Group entities.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The key areas where estimates have been used and the assumption applied are in the impairment testing of goodwill note 11 and in assessing the defined benefit pension scheme liabilities note 19.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year to 31 December 2005.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date control ceases.
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains or losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Notes to the Group Financial Statements Rotork 39 for the year ended 31 December 2005 Annual Report 2005 continued Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the values were determined.
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to sterling at rates approximating those ruling at the date of the transactions.
Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries, and from the translation of the results of those subsidiaries at average rate, are recognised directly in equity.
Any differences that have arisen since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a separate component of equity.
Translation differences that arose before the date of transition to IFRS in respect of all foreign entities are not presented as a separate component.
Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work performed.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated completion costs, the possible return of goods or continuing management involvement with the goods.
Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries.
In respect of acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Negative goodwill arising on acquisitions would be recognised directly in profit and loss.
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP on transition.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 has not been reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004.
Goodwill is stated at cost or deemed cost less any impairment losses.
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is allocated to cash-generating units.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
ii Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Development costs incurred after the point at which the commercial and technical feasibility of the product have been proven, and the decision to complete the development has been taken and resources made available, are capitalised.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Development expenditure has an estimated useful life of 5 years and is written off on a straight-line basis.
iii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The useful life of each of these assets is assessed on an individual basis and they range from 1 to 15 years.
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.
40 Rotork Notes to the Group Financial Statements Annual Report 2005 for the year ended 31 December 2005 continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Freehold land is not depreciated.
Long leasehold buildings are amortised over fifty years or the expected useful life of the building where less than fifty years.
Other assets are depreciated by equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated useful lives and residual values at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 4% Short leasehold buildings period of lease Machinery, plant and equipment 10% to 33% Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation.
Certain items of property that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
Leases Where fixed assets are financed by leasing agreements, which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as obligations under finance leases.
Assets acquired under finance leases are initially recognised at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The rentals payable are apportioned between interest, which is charged to the income statement, and liability, which reduces the outstanding obligation so as to give a constant rate of charge on the outstanding lease obligations.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease in arriving at the operating profit.
Taxation Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or subsequently enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profits.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Inventory and work in progress Inventory and work in progress is valued at the lower of cost, on a first in, first out basis, and net realisable value.
In respect of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes all production overheads and the attributable proportion of indirect overhead expenses which are required to bring inventories to their present location and condition.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term with an original maturity less than three months deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Share capital Equity comprises issued capital, share premium and reserves.
When issued capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
Repurchased shares are debited direct to equity and shown as a deduction from retained earnings.
Notes to the Group Financial Statements Rotork 41 for the year ended 31 December 2005 Annual Report 2005 continued Provisions A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty cost data, known issues and management expectations of future costs.
Employee benefits i Pension plans The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes and contributes to these schemes in accordance with qualified actuaries recommendations.
All actuarial gains and losses as at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, were recognised.
In respect of all actuarial gains and losses that arise after that date in calculating the Groups obligation in respect of the plan, these are recognised in equity.
Interest on pension scheme liabilities has been recognised within financing expenses and the expected return on scheme assets within financing income in the consolidated income statement.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes.
The costs for these schemes are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
ii Share-based payment transactions The Rotork Share Option Scheme allows certain employees to acquire shares in Rotork p. l. c. This scheme is now closed and the last grant of new options took place in 2004.
Details of the scheme are given in note 19.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest.
The Rotork Sharesave Plan, introduced in 2004, offers certain employees the opportunity to purchase shares in Rotork p. l. c. at a discounted price compared with the market price at the time of grant.
The fair value of the right option is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period between grant and maturity.
The right option reaches maturity when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled.
The fair value of the grant is measured using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted.
The Rotork Long-Term Share Incentive Plan grants awards of shares to executive directors and senior managers.
These awards may vest after a period of four years dependent upon both market and non-market performance conditions being met.
Details of the grants are given in note 19.
This plan gives share awards or cash awards of equivalent value to the share awards dependent upon the employees country of residence at date of grant.
The fair value of the award is measured at grant date, using a Monte Carlo simulation model which takes into account the market based performance criteria, and spread over the vesting period.
The fair value of the award is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity for the share settled award and a provision within employee benefits for the cash settled award.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to exclude options that do not vest as a result of non-market performance conditions not being met.
All grants under these schemes made after 7 November 2002 have been accounted for under IFRS 2.
Those made before this date are accounted for under UK GAAP and any accruals in respect of these schemes are held in employee benefits.
iii Long-term service leave The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service leave is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
iv Other employee incentive schemes In addition to the above schemes the Group offers a number of other bonus and incentive schemes to employees around the world.
The costs of these schemes are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
This includes the Share Incentive Plan and Overseas Profit Linked Share Scheme both of which are a known liability at the year end.
42 Rotork Notes to the Group Financial Statements Annual Report 2005 for the year ended 31 December 2005 continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Effect of first time adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 1 January 2005 The Group has taken advantage of the transitional arrangements of IFRS 1 not to restate corresponding amounts in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Instead the following policies were applied in respect of financial instruments issued by the Group, investments in debt and equity securities, derivative financial instruments and hedging.
In the comparative period all financial assets and financial liabilities were carried at cost amortised as appropriate less, in the case of financial assets, provision for any permanent diminution in value.
Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts treated as hedging instruments were not recognised in the income statement.
On recognition of the hedged transaction the unrecognised gains and losses arising on the instrument were recognised, either in the income statement or combined into the carrying value of the associated asset or liability.
The following adjustment necessary to implement the revised policy has been made as at 1 January 2005.
Corresponding amounts for 2004 are presented and disclosed in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985, FRS 13 and FRS 4 as applicable in 2004.
Effect on the balance sheet on 1 January 2005 Increase in other receivables gains on effective cash flow hedges 373 Increase in other payables losses on effective cash flow hedges 96 Increase in non-current interest bearing liabilities presentation of preference shares as debt 47 Reduction in preference shares presentation of preference shares as debt 47 Increase in retained earnings net gain on effective cash flow hedges 277 The nature and main effect of these changes on the consolidated balance sheet at 1 January 2005 and the 2005 consolidated income statement are as follows: In 2005 hedging instruments and hedged items are accounted for separately in the balance sheet.
Gains and losses are both included in profit for the year when they arise fair value hedges or when the hedged transaction occurs having first recorded those on the hedging instrument in equity cash flow hedges, to the extent effective.
In 2004 hedging instruments were not recognised and hedged items were held at cost without any adjustment in respect of the hedged risk.
On 1 January 2005 the hedged items and hedging instruments are brought separately on to the balance sheet in accordance with the 2005 policy.
The cash flow statement is unaffected by this change in accounting policy.
The Companys preference shares are treated as part of shareholders funds in 2004 and as liabilities in 2005.
Derivative financial instruments applicable from 1 January 2005 onwards The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from operational and financing activities.
These are the only form of derivative financial instruments used by the Group.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue forward exchange contracts for trading purposes.
However, forward contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Forward exchange contracts are recognised initially at cost and then subsequently re-measured at fair value.
Where a forward exchange contract is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised liability, a firm commitment or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the forward contract is recognised directly in equity.
The cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction still is expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss held in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.

Analysis of revenue, profit and net assets The primary format used for segmental reporting is by business segment as this reflects the internal management structure and reporting of the Group.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated expenses comprise corporate expenses and unallocated assets and liabilities comprise cash, borrowings, tax assets and liabilities respectively.
Inter group trading is determined on an arms length basis.
Business segments The Group comprises the following business segments: Electrics the design, manufacture and sale of electric valve actuators Gears the design, manufacture and sale of gearboxes, adaption and ancillaries for the valve industry Fluid system the design, manufacture and sale of heavy duty pneumatic and hydraulic valve actuators Geographic segments Rotork has a worldwide presence in all three business segments through its subsidiary selling offices and through an agency network.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements Rotork 45 for the year ended 31 December 2005 Annual Report 2005 continued 3.
Acquisition of subsidiaries Acquisitions On 2 March 2005 Rotork Controls Deutschland GmbH acquired all of the business and assets of PC Intertechnik GmbH for up to 6,520,000.
1,282,000 was paid on completion and a further 4,792,000 was paid during 2005.
The remaining 446,000 outstanding at December 2005 may be paid in 2006 subject to satisfaction of certain warranties and achievement of sales related targets.
The company manufactures and sells pneumatic and hydraulic actuators, controls and associated products.
The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of consolidation.
In the 10 months to 31 December 2005 the subsidiary contributed 4,163,000 to Group revenue and 232,000 to the consolidated net profit for the year before the 151,000 amortisation of intangible charge.
Goodwill has arisen on this acquisition as a result of the synergies Rotork will derive from the business being part of the fluid system division.
Due to a lack of reliable information for the two months prior to acquiring the assets, full year proforma financial results are not given in these financial statements.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities.

Deanquip Valve Automation Pty Ltd was renamed Rotork Fluid System Pty Ltd in January 2005.
The company markets and sells pneumatic and hydraulic actuators, controls and associated products in Australia.
In the 12 months to 31 December 2004 the subsidiary contributed 1,622,000 to Group revenue and 43,000 to the consolidated net profit for the year.
The value of intangibles is based on an assessment by management.

The Group continues to expect its effective rate of corporation tax to be slightly higher than the standard UK rate due to higher rates of tax in the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and India.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the unremitted earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax liability for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries.
Rotork p. l. c. controls the dividend policies of its subsidiaries and subsequently the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences.

These calculations use cash flow projections and are based on actual operating results and the latest Group three-year plan.
The three-year plan is based on managements view of the future and experience of past performance.
Cash flows for the remainder of the next twenty years are extrapolated using a two per cent growth rate which reflects the long-term nature of many of the markets the Group serves.
This rate has been consistently bettered in the past so is believed to represent a prudent estimate.
A pre-tax discount rate of 9%, being the Groups weighted average cost of capital, has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
On this basis no impairment write downs are required.
This asset principally relates to other temporary differences in the defined benefit pension schemes.
The directors are of the opinion, based on recent and forecast trading that the level of profits in the current and future years make it more likely than not that the asset will be recovered.

Capital and reserves continued The ordinary shareholders are entitled to receive dividends as declared and are entitled to vote at meetings of the Company.
The preference shareholders take priority over the ordinary shareholders when there is a distribution upon winding-up the Company or on a reduction of equity involving a return of capital.
The holders of preference shares are entitled to vote at a general meeting of the Company if a preference dividend is in arrears for six months or the business of the meeting includes the consideration of a resolution for winding-up the Company or the alteration of the preference shareholders rights.
In these accounts IAS 32 has been applied from 1 January 2005 and the preference shares have been reclassified as debt because interest payments cannot be deferred and an ordinary dividend still paid.
The only ordinary shares issued during the year were 198,634 2004: 161,137 under The Rotork Employee Share Option Schemes at prices between 192p and 372p 2004: 192p and 328p.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share Earnings per share is calculated for both the current and previous years using the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders for the year.
The earnings per share calculation is based on 86.1 million shares 2004: 85.8 million shares being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for the year.

The number of shares is equal to the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Company has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and contingently issuable shares awarded under the Long-term incentive plan.

Total expense relating to these plans in the year was 519,000 2004: 533,000.
Share based payments Volatility assumptions for equity based payments The expected volatility of all equity compensation benefits is based on the historic volatility calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of each benefit, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
a Share option scheme At 1 January 1995 the Group established a share option programme for employees.
The allocation of options was linked to the completion of 5 years service.
In accordance with the programme, once vested the options grant the right to purchase shares at the market price they were at the date of grant.
Exercise prices range from 192p to 387p.
Options vest after three years and expire ten years after being granted.
Only the 2003 and 2004 grant occurred after 7 November 2002, the start date for recognition under IFRS 2.
Therefore only charges in respect of these grants have been made to the accounts in accordance with IFRS 2 and the relevant disclosures made below.
Additionally, six share option arrangements granted before 7 November 2002 exist.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to these grants in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.

Employee benefits continued b Long-term Incentive Plan The LTIP is a performance share or cash unit plan under which shares or cash units are conditionally allocated to selected members of senior management at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on an annual basis.
No shares or cash units will normally be released to participants unless they are still in the Groups service following completion of four year performance periods and the Companys relative TSR against a comparator group of companies places it in at least the 50th percentile position in the comparator group at the end of the relevant performance period.
TSR measures the change in value of a share and reinvested dividends over the period of measurement.
The actual number of shares or cash units transferred will be determined by the number of shares or cash units initially allocated multiplied by a vesting percentage which will be 40% at the 50th percentile rising to 100% at the 75th percentile with each percentile position above the 50th adding 2.4% to the vesting percentage.
The Companys earnings per share is also monitored during the relevant performance period to ensure it meets a minimum average annual growth equal to the rise in the Retail Price Index plus 2% per annum.
Failure to meet the RPI requirement will result in nil vesting.
Following shareholder approval of the LTIP at the Companys Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2000, awards over shares were made to executive directors and senior managers in each year from 2000 to 2004.
The performance period for the 2001 Award ended at 31 December 2004.
Messrs Hewitt Bacon and Woodrow as independent actuaries have certified to the Remuneration Committee that there was a 100% vesting of this Award as the Companys position relative to the comparator group at the end of the relevant performance period was above the 75th percentile position and the Companys earnings per share growth has exceeded the growth in the Retail Price Index plus 2% per annum.
The performance period for the 2002 Award ended at 31 December 2005.
Messrs Hewitt Bacon and Woodrow as independent actuaries have certified to the Remuneration Committee that there was a 74% vesting of this Award as the Companys position relative to the comparator group at the end of the relevant performance period was on the 64th percentile and the Companys earnings per share growth has exceeded the growth in the Retail Price Index plus 2% per annum.
The awards will vest during 2006.

Financial instruments Financial risk and treasury policies The treasury department maintains liquidity, manages relations with the Groups bankers, identifies and manages foreign exchange risk and provides a treasury service to the Groups businesses.
Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
Group treasury is not a profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure.
Exposures resulting from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and the net exposure may be hedged by the use of forward exchange contracts.
Credit risk Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all customers requiring credit above a certain threshold, with varying approval levels set above this depending on the value of sale.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Interest rate risk The Group does not undertake any hedging activity in this area.
All foreign currency cash deposits are made at prevailing interest rates and where rates are fixed the period of the fix is generally no more than 1 month.
The main element of interest rate risk concerns sterling deposits which are made on a floating LIBOR based rate and short term overdrafts in foreign currencies which are also on a floating rate.
The interest rate profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: Interest Rates Fixed rate Floating rate Fixed rate Floating rate of interest of interest of interest of interest 2005 2005 2004 2004 US dollar 6.4% 31 Euro 2.6% - 5.6% 166 1,388 187 473 Yen 1.9% - 2.5% 148 35 102 66 Other 9.5% - 11.0% 47 135 166 361 1,589 289 705 The floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank loans overdrafts bearing interest rates fixed by reference to the relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate.
The weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate financial liabilities is 3.0% per annum.
The weighted average period for which interest rates on the fixed rate financial liabilities are fixed is 1 year.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: 2005 2004 In one year or less 1,717 726 In more than one year but not more than two years 101 126 In more than two years but not more than five years 85 142 In more than five years 47 Total 1,950 994 The Group had no undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December 2005.

Financial instruments continued The interest rate profile of the financial assets held as part of the financing arrangements of the Group at 31 December was as follows: Interest Rates Fixed rate Other cash Fixed rate Other cash cash cash 2005 2005 2004 2004 Sterling 4.1% - 4.6% 15,121 14,314 662 US dollar 4.1% 2,071 2,696 2,258 3,264 Euro 2.2% - 2.3% 2,016 3,080 940 1,859 Other 0.01% - 4.0% 189 2,705 316 1,685 4,276 23,602 17,828 7,470 All foreign currency cash deposits are held on fixed rates of interest.
All other cash amounts are on floating rates or overnight rates based on the relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate.
Further analysis of the interest rate profile at 31 December is as follows: 2005 Fixed rate 2004 Fixed rate Weighted average Weighted average Weighted average Weighted average interest rate period for fixed rate interest rate period for fixed rate % months % months Sterling 4.6 1 4.8 0 US dollar 4.1 0 2.3 1 Euro 2.2 0 2.1 1 Group 4.4 1 4.5 1 Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk primarily are US dollar and related currencies and the euro.
The Group hedges up to 80% of forecast US dollar or euro foreign currency exposures using forward exchange contracts.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than sterling, the Group ensures that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts at 1 January 2005 was adjusted against the opening balance of the hedging reserve at that date.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges at 31 December 2005 was a 241,000 loss 2004: 277,000 gain comprising a 43,000 asset 2004: 373,000 and a 284,000 liability 2004: 96,000.
No fair value adjustment was made in 2004 but a prior year adjustment was made at 1 January 2005 under IAS.
Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement.

The Group entered into a currency swap in February 2005 when 9.0m was borrowed to finance the acquisition of PC Intertechnik, linked to a deposit of 6.2m, at an exchange rate of 1.444 1.000.
The 9m was paid to Rotork Controls Deutschland GmbH in a form of redeemable equity as this company purchased the assets of PC Intertechnik.
This swap was entered into to protect the Group from currency movements on the repayment of equity from Germany.
Sensitivity analysis It is estimated that a general change of one percentage point in the value of either the US dollar or euro against sterling would have had a 150k impact on the Groups profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2005.
The impact of forward exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.
Currency exposures The table below shows the Groups balance sheet currency exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that were not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
At 31 December these exposures were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities 2005 Functional currency of Group operation Sterling US dollar Euro Other Total Sterling 4,505 2,193 2,723 9,421 US dollar 1,096 6 2,518 3,608 Euro 1,165 232 17 916 Other 232 849 1,081 Total 2,493 4,737 2,199 627 3,816 68 Rotork Notes to the Group Financial Statements Annual Report 2005 for the year ended 31 December 2005 continued 22.

Fair values The fair values together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet are as follows: Carrying Fair Value Carrying Fair Value Amount Amount 2005 2005 2004 2004 Trade and other receivables 41,277 41,277 38,761 38,761 Cash and cash equivalents 27,878 27,878 25,298 25,298 Currency swap deposit 5,298 5,298 Forward exchange contracts Assets 43 43 373 Liabilities 252 252 96 Currency swap loan 5,298 5,298 Secured loans 1,039 1,039 334 334 Preference shares 47 47 Finance lease liabilities 166 166 187 187 Trade and other payable 34,601 34,601 31,062 31,062 Bank overdrafts 698 698 473 473 32,395 32,395 32,003 32,280 Unrecognised gain 277 As the elements of the currency swap can legally be offset, although the values of the loan and deposit are shown above they have been offset in the consolidated balance sheet.
Estimation of fair values Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are valued at year end spot adjusted for the forward points to the contracts value date, and gains and losses taken to equity.
No contracts value date is greater than one year from the year end.
Secured loans As the loans have a flexible repayment schedule, and may be paid down in less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Trade and other receivables payables As the receivables payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements Rotork 71 for the year ended 31 December 2005 Annual Report 2005 continued 28.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Notes to the explanation of transition to IFRS a Intangible assets No amortisation of goodwill is charged to the income statement in the year under IFRS.
Under UK GAAP 1,293,000 was charged during the year so this has been reversed.
Development costs of 992,000 at 1 January 2004 and 772,000 at 31 December 2004 that qualified for recognition as an intangible asset under IFRSs had not been recognised under UK GAAP.
They are recognised under IFRS at the date of transition and at 31 December 2004 respectively.
During 2004 322,000 of development expenditure was amortised and 102,000 of costs expensed under UK GAAP were capitalised.
b Deferred tax assets Under UK GAAP the defined benefit pension scheme liability was reflected in the financial statements net of deferred taxation.
On transition to IFRS this has been shown in the accounts as a deferred tax asset.
The deferred tax asset on accumulated actuarial gains and losses at 1 January 2004 was 5,850,000, the tax charge in the year was 101,000 resulting in an asset of 5,951,000 at 31 December 2004.
All other deferred tax assets which were shown within debtors have been transferred to non-current assets and deferred tax has been provided on the share based payments: 1 January Movement 31 December 2004 2004 Deferred tax asset Previously in pension liabilities 5,850 101 5,951 Previously in debtors 954 37 917 Previously in deferred tax liabilities 253 253 Amortisation of intangibles 2121 Share based payments 155 18 173 Set off of tax 354 27 327 Total 6,605 383 6,988 c Acquisition of subsidiary The acquisition of Deanquip Valve Automation in January 2004 has been restated under IFRS 3.
As a consequence of applying IFRS 3 the acquisition has been re-examined with a view to identifying specific intangibles.
As a result intangibles previously treated as goodwill and amortised over 20 years are now being held on the balance sheet and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
The intangible assets identified and the charge to the accounts in 2004 in respect of these intangibles is as follows: Intangible at Amortisation acquisition charge in 2004 Company name 31 21 Customer relationships 233 15 Order backlog at acquisition 25 25 Agency agreements 60 12 Currency adjustment 3 349 70 Goodwill 322 671 70 The intangible amortisation for the year has been charged partly in cost of sales 50,000 and partly in administration expenses 20,000.
Notes to the Group Financial Statements Rotork 73 for the year ended 31 December 2005 Annual Report 2005 continued 28.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued d Reserves A number of reserves are required under IFRS which were not recorded under UK GAAP.
The breakdown of this movement at 31 December 2004 is as follows: UK GAAP Adjustment IFRS Capital redemption reserve 1,637 1,637 Revaluation reserve 2,405 2,405 Translation reserve 1,212 1,212 Total 4,042 3,617 425 The revaluation reserve is eliminated under IFRS as on first time adoption the value at which the assets are held is deemed to be cost.
The translation reserve historically under UK GAAP has been included in the retained earnings reserve.
e Employee benefits Rotork adopted FRS 17 for the 2004 year end under UK GAAP.
Liabilities under the Group defined benefit pension schemes were shown on the face of the balance sheet but were stated net of the associated deferred tax asset.
Under IFRS the deferred tax has been transferred to noncurrent assets see note b above and the pension liability shown gross under employee liabilities.
Under IFRS certain liabilities have been reclassified as employee benefits from payables and provisions.
These are: 1 January Movement 31 December 2004 2004 UK GAAP employee liabilities 13,653 232 13,885 Transfer to deferred tax assets see note b 5,850 101 5,951 Transfer from provisions 1,037 399 638 Transfer from other payables non share based payment accruals 1,447 573 2,020 Transfer from other payables share based payment accruals 1,102 516 1,618 Adjustment of share based payments to IFRS 323 220 543 Total 22,766 803 23,569 74 Rotork Notes to the Group Financial Statements Annual Report 2005 for the year ended 31 December 2005 continued 28.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued f Deferred taxation liabilities Under UK GAAP certain properties had been revalued.
This revaluation was shown within reserves as a separate reserve but under IFRS this has been consolidated into retained earnings.
On transition, following IFRS 1 the revaluations have been deemed cost.
As a consequence deferred tax of 722,000 has been provided on the balance at 1 January and 31 December 2004.
In addition, the capitalisation of development costs has led to a reduction in the historic charge to the income statement and requires the creation of a deferred tax liability.
The liability at 1 January 2004 was 297,000 reducing by 65,000 during the year to 232,000 at 31 December 2004.
1 January Movement 31 December 2004 2004 Deferred tax liability UK GAAP deferred tax liabilities 128 147 275 Previously in deferred tax assets 253 253 Revaluation reserve tax liability 722 722 Capitalised development costs liability 297 65 232 Set off of tax 354 27 327 Total 793 362 1,155 g Other payables Under UK GAAP dividends are accounted for once proposed but IFRS only reports dividends as a charge to the accounts once paid.
Reversal of the proposed dividend has reduced other payables by 8,341,000.
Together with the 3,638,000 transfer in respect of UK GAAP employee benefits noted above this accounts for the 11,979,000 reduction in other payables.

Explanation of transition to IFRS continued h Employee share schemes The Group applied IFRS 2 to its active share based payment arrangements at 1 January 2004 except for those granted before 7 November 2002.
The effect of accounting for equity settled share based payment transactions at fair value is to increase cost of sales by 17,000 and reduce administrative expenses by 29,000.
The reduction in administrative expenses reflects the reversal of provisions made under UK GAAP for the Long-Term Incentive Plan as these were higher than the charges under IFRS 2. i Income tax expense The income tax charge in the income statement has changed as a result of some of the UK GAAP to IFRS adjustments.
The analysis of the net change is: Amortisation of intangibles see note b 21 Cash settled share based payments see note b 18 Capitalised development costs see note f 65 Equity settled share based payments 21 83 j Exchange gains and losses Under UK GAAP exchange gains and losses were reported in operating profit.
Under IFRS any gains and losses resulting from retranslation of currency deposits are shown in net financing income which has resulted in Other income being reduced by 495,000 and other expenses being reduced by 54,000, the net result of 440,000 now being presented as a credit in net financing income.
