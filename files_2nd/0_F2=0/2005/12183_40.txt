b Borrowing facilities The Group has various available borrowing facilities.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31st March 2005, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, were as follows: 2005 2004 Group Group m m Expiring in more than two years 365 433 Expiring between one and two years 72 437 433 c Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The fair values of the financial instruments are the amounts at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.
Market values have been used to determine the fair value of all swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
The fair value of all other items has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The following summarises the carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities: Financial assets cash deposits and marketable investments The book value and the fair value equate due to the short-term nature of the investments.
Financial liabilities The book value of long-term borrowings amounts to 597 million 2004 615 million whereas the fair value amounts to 650 million 2004 686 million.
The difference between fair value and book value is due to the fixed rates of interest paid on long-term debt.
The book values and the fair values of all other financial liabilities, including non-interest bearing creditors and contractual provisions, are not materially different.
Derivative financial instruments The fair value of interest rate swaps is 19 million payable 2004 4 million payable.
These are not recognised in the financial statements in 2005 and 2004.
The book value of the energy hedges amounts to nil 2004 nil whereas the fair value amounts to a gain of 13 million 2004 3 million.
The book value of the forward foreign exchange contracts amounts to nil 2004 nil whereas the fair value amounts to a gain of nil 2004 2 million.
d Hedges The Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures within the parameters set out in the Finance Directors Review in the Operating and Financial Review: Interest rate risk using interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
Foreign currency transaction exposures using forward foreign currency contracts.
Energy exposures using commodity swap contracts for the appropriate fuel.
Gains or losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
