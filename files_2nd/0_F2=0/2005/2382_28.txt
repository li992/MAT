Solvay held 50% of BP Solvay Polyethylene Europe and 51% of BP Solvay Polyethylene North America.
The total consideration for the acquisition was $1,391 million.
See Note 3, Acquisitions, for more information.
The methodology to determine the option exercise price was laid out in the original agreement creating the polyethylene joint venture.
Management believed that this price was high compared with the likely recoverable amount for the businesses and conducted an impairment test.
The cash flows for the next five years were derived from the five-year group plan.
Cost inflation rate was assumed to be 2% throughout the period.
For determining the value in use for each of the businesses, a period of 20 years was used, with a terminal value based on the value of working capital releases.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period were extrapolated based on the final year of the five-year group plan using unchanged margin and volume assumptions for the subsequent years.
The key assumptions to which the calculations of value in use were most sensitive were variable contribution margin, production volumes and discount rate.
The values assigned to the variable contribution margin were rising across the plan period from $175 to $179 per tonne for Europe and $153 to $194 per tonne for US and annual sales volumes were also rising in the plan period from 1,065,000 tonnes to 1,273,000 tonnes in Europe and from 882,000 tonnes to 907,000 tonnes in the US.
These key assumptions reflected past experience and were consistent with external sources.
The recoverable amount of the European business was $631 million lower than the acquisition fair values.
This impairment was first applied to the goodwill amount of $325 million and the balance recognized against the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.
The recoverable amount of the US business exceeded its carrying amount by $289 million.
There were additional selling costs and closing adjustments of $59 million in 2005, which created additional goodwill of $59 million.
