32 Friends Provident Annual Report & Accounts 2005 INTERNATIONAL LIFE & PENSIONS ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK IFRS underlying profit IFRS underlying profit before tax increased by 31% to 224 million 2004: 171m, mainly because of the increase in the Asset Management underlying profit following 2005 31% 224m the F&C merger last year.
The total Life & Pensions underlying profit was 4% up in 2004 171m 2005.
The longer-term investment return rates assumed were unchanged from 2004.
The prospective rates for 2006 are: equities 7.25% 2005: 7.5%, property 6.25% IFRS profit before tax 7.5%, gilts 4.25% 5.0% and other fixed interest 4.75% 5.75%.
2005 66% 367m IFRS profit before tax from continuing operations increased by 66% to 367 million 2004 221m 2004: 221m.
In addition to the above, this takes into account the actual investment returns achieved during the year, offset by the impacts of nonrecurring and other items, which are discussed below.
It is also shown gross of policyholder tax and minority interests in accordance with the IFRS rules.
UK Life & Pensions underlying profit UK Life & Pensions underlying profit has increased by 28% to 138 million 2004: 108m.
The increase was mainly due to reduced strain on protection business, good 2005 28% 138m surplus on income protection business, offset by higher group pensions new business 2004 108m strain.
There were also some positive one-off impacts and basis changes.
This comprises the With Profits Fund with-profits business of 7 million 2004: 7m, With Profits Fund other business 60 million 2004: 26m, other life business 8 million 2004: 10m negative and longer-term investment return 63 million 2004: 85m.
International Life & Pensions underlying profit International Life & Pensions underlying profit has reduced to nil 2004: 25m.
This decrease relates to FPI where increasing sales of certain products, although 2005 nil economically profitable, lead to IFRS losses.
This occurs because actuarial funding 2004 25m techniques, which have the effect of reducing new business strain, are not recognised under IFRS.
Asset Management underlying profit Asset Management underlying profit has increased by 170% to 108 million 2004: 40m.
For the Asset Management business, underlying profits under IFRS are 2005 170% 108m the same as EEV and are discussed on page 29.
2004 40m Corporate items Corporate items comprise the expected return on the net pension liability of 2 million negative 2004: 8m positive, expected return on corporate net assets of 2005 -22m 6 million negative 2004: nil, less corporate costs of 14 million 2004: 10m.
2004 -2m Other profit items Other profit items excluded from underlying profit but included in profit before tax are shown in the table on page 32.
The non-recurring items, amortisation and impairment 2005 186% 143m of intangible assets are all discussed on page 31.
The other main items are: 2004 50m Policyholder tax and returns on Group controlled funds attributable to third parties the latter mainly representing the minority interest held in F&C Commercial Property Trust, which is 58% owned by the Groups long term funds are excluded from underlying profit as neither is attributable to shareholders.
The increase in the amortisation of acquired present value of in-force business to 28 million 2004: 10m is due to the inclusion of Lombard in 2005.
Within the calculation of underlying IFRS profit as in EEV we account for the STICS as debt to reflect the economic reality.
However we are required under the IFRS rules to account for STICS as equity in calculating IFRS profit before tax.
We therefore add back the STICS interest that was deducted in calculating underlying profit.
Short-term fluctuations in investment return of 102 million 2004: 27m reflects the better than expected stock market returns achieved in 2005.
IFRS Dividend cover Total dividend for 2005 of 7.7 pence per share including the proposed final dividend of 5.1 pence per share represents an increase over 2004 of 2%.
This is covered 2005 1.1 times 1.1 times 2004: 1.2 times by IFRS underlying profit after tax and minority interests, 2004 1.2 times although this is not a good indication of dividend paying capacity as it does not reflect distributable reserves or cash generation.
