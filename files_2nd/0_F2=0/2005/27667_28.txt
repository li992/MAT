Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 continued 4 ITEMS INCLUDED IN PROFIT BEFORE TAX BUT EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT continued vii Fines and penalties During 2004, the US asset management affiliate, Liberty Ridge Capital Inc. formerly known as Pilgrim Baxter & Associates, Ltd PBA, reached agreements with the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and the Office of the New York State Attorney General NYAG which settled all charges brought by these authorities against PBA in relation to market timing in the US mutual fund business.
PBA agreed to pay $40 million in disgorgement of past fees, as well as $50 million in civil penalties.
This resulted in a charge of 49 million for the period ended 30 June 2004, which has been taken to the consolidated income statement, but excluded from adjusted operating profit.
Tax deductions were recognised on the disgorgement of past fees, resulting in a tax credit of 8 million.
In addition, PBA agreed to fee reductions to investors of approximately $10 million over the five years from 2004.
There are several related private lawsuits arising from the conduct alleged in the civil suits filed by the SEC and NYAG.
These class action lawsuits were consolidated into a single lawsuit along with all other cases against US parties alleging market timing and late trading violations.
Proceedings in this case are ongoing, but it is not possible to say, at this time, whether or not the amount of the ultimate liability to be borne by the Group will be material.
Other claims have now been received in relation to the impact of the matter on the value of Liberty Ridge Capital Inc. and the subsequent reduction in the value of employee remuneration plans and other such consequences.
These claims are at a preliminary stage.
As a result, no amount has been recognised for any settlement of the above claims, as significant uncertainty remains over the quantum of any settlement.
