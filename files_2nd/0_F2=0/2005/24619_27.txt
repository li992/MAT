Auditors Remuneration continued The transition to IFRS has impacted on the level of auditors remuneration.
Statutory audit fees for 2005 include 0.3m 2004 nil arising from the introduction of IFRS, while audit-related regulatory reporting fees include 1.3m 2004 1.6m for audit-related services in relation to the transition and comparative financials.
In 2004 further assurance services include 1.2m for other services provided in relation to the IFRS transition project.
In addition to the above, audit-related regulatory reporting includes fees for audit reviews in relation to capital and debt issues, regulatory matters and the interim results.
Further assurance services include advice concerning accounting and regulatory matters, in particular in relation to securitisations, covered bond issues and a financial systems review.
Non-audit fees include 1.5m 2004 0.7m arising outwith the UK.
These services are for the provision of overseas tax advice and preparation of tax returns in overseas jurisdictions and other services related to the expansion of our businesses in Australia and Ireland.
Included within non-audit fees are 0.5m 2004 0.5m of fees which have been capitalised during the year and are included in issue costs for certain securitisation and capital issues.
In respect of the Company, statutory audit fees were 20,000 2004 15,000 and other fees amounted to 1.1m 2004 1.3m.
All fees arose within the UK.
Each year the Audit Committee reviews the policy covering the engagement of the external auditors to undertake non-audit work on behalf of the Group.
For 2005 the Audit Committee established a limit such that the fees for non-audit services undertaken by KPMG Audit Plc and its associates should not exceed the fees for audit services.
Post Retirement Benefits The Group operates pension schemes, post retirement medical plans and concessionary mortgage plans on both a defined benefit and defined contribution basis.
Defined contribution post employment benefit plans The principal Group defined contribution plan, is the HBOS Group Money Purchase Scheme.
This plan is open to new employees as the principal defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.
It is funded by contributions from employees and the Group.
Normal employee contributions are made at rates between 2% to 5% and Group contributions can range between 3% to 8%.
These arrangements are due to change in April 2006.
The expense of all Group defined contribution plans for the year ended 31 December 2005 is 20m 2004 15m.
Defined benefit post employment benefit plans The Group provides several defined benefit plans.
The principal defined benefit pension plans are the Halifax Retirement Fund and the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme together The Schemes, which are funded schemes.
Separate disclosure of all other defined benefit pension plans within the Group are made under the heading Other Schemes.
These contain a mixture of funded and unfunded schemes.
Separate disclosure is also made on a combined basis for the unfunded post retirement medical plans and concessionary mortgage plans under the heading Other Post Retirement Benefits.
By the end of 2006 the Group will make additional contributions of 800m to reduce the deficits of these defined benefit pension plans, of which 120m was paid in 2005.
In addition to these contributions the Group will make ordinary contributions of 145m in 2006.
The assets of The Schemes are held in trust funds which are independent of the Groups own assets.
In determining the level of contributions required to be made to The Schemes and the relevant charges to the Groups income statement, the Group has been advised by independent actuaries.
The most recently published formal valuations of the Halifax Retirement Fund and the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme were carried out as at 31 March 2003 and 31 December 2004, respectively.
The financial assumptions are derived based upon the economic conditions prevailing at the date of valuation.

Share-based Payments The Group believes that share ownership by colleagues throughout the Group enhances their alignment with shareholders interests.
Therefore, colleagues in the Group are able to own shares through various share-based payment arrangements.
During the year ended 31 December 2005, the Group operated the following share-based payment arrangements, which are predominantly equity-settled: Sharesave plan This is a standard tax-approved scheme that is available to all colleagues.
Share option plans The final award under the HBOS plan, which has now been replaced by free shares, was made in 2004.
Under this plan options over shares at market value, with a face value equal to 20% of salary, were awarded to all colleagues.
A separate option plan exists for St. Jamess Place.
Free shares This was introduced in 2005 under the share incentive plan legislation as a replacement for the share option plan not including the St. Jamess Place plan.
In broad terms, it covers all colleagues and free shares of 5% of salary, up to a limit of 3,000 are awarded to each colleague.
Sharekicker plan This provides colleagues with the opportunity to purchase shares with a proportion of their annual net bonus.
For every two shares purchased a matching share is awarded after three years.
Long term incentive plan This is offered to some of the Groups most senior colleagues.
A full description of the plan is provided on page 79 of the Report of the Board in relation to remuneration policy and practice.
Executive stock option plan The final award under this plan was in 2000.
Under this plan, options were granted at market value to certain colleagues.
The options vested upon satisfaction of a performance measure over a three year period.
Options are exercisable from the date the measure is satisfied until the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
During 2005, no modifications were made to share-based payment arrangements and none were settled or cancelled.
Under the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment the Group has applied the IFRS to share awards and options granted after 7 November 2002 that had not yet vested at the effective date of the IFRS.
The table below summarises the share-based payment awards since 7 November 2002: Sharesave Share Free Sharekicker Long term 2 plan option plans shares plan incentive plan Awards in 2003 Date of grant 19 September 21 March - 21 March 2 January Number granted 12,086,658 35,621,479 - 5,421,801 4 1,846,609 5 Awards in 2004 Date of grant 21 September 16 March - 23 March 31 March Number granted 13,182,646 37,880,273 - 5,543,693 4 2,191,468 5 Awards in 2005 Date of grant 23 September 3 March 10 August 23 March 30 March Number granted 10,381,241 476,401 7,352,056 4,989,559 4 1,892,966 6 Contractual life 3.5, 5.5 and 6 years 3 3 years 3 years 3 years 7.5 years Vesting conditions 3.25, 5.25 and 7.25 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years vesting period 1 service service service service and achievement of TSR target 7 Notes: 1 Although the savings periods are three, five and seven years the vesting periods are slightly longer since savings do not commence until December each year.

Share-based Payments continued Financial assumptions underlying the calculation of fair value The fair value expense has been based on the fair value of the instruments granted, as calculated using appropriate pricing models.
The table below shows the assumptions and models used to calculate the grant date fair value of each award: Sharesave Share option Free Sharekicker Long term 2 plan plans shares plan incentive plan Awards in 2003 Fair value pence 222.0 184.0 286.0 859.0 Share price pence 717.0 654.0 654.0 655.0 Exercise price pence 574.0 654.0 0.0 0.0 1 Expected volatility % p. a.
4.0 3.8 N A 4.0 N A Risk-free interest rate 4.2 4.9 N A N A N A 3 Pricing model BlackBinomial BlackMonte Carlo Scholes Lattice Scholes Simulation Notes 1 Expected volatility is based on an analysis of both the Groups historical volatility over the twelve months preceding the date of each award and the volatility implied by the price of traded options as at the date of each award.
2 The assumptions above for the 2003 and 2004 awards do not reflect the St Jamess Place plan.
Assumptions for this plan do not differ materially.
3 As no performance calculations attach to these awards and dividends are reinvested, the fair value is the same as the face value of the awards.
4 Dividends payable on the matching shares during the vesting period are not awarded to the recipient.
5 Dividends payable on the shares during the vesting period are reinvested and so no dividend yield assumption is required.
Early exercise assumptions The following allowance has been made for the impact of early exercise once options have vested: Sharesave plan As the length of the exercise window is only six months all option holders are assumed to exercise halfway through the exercise window.
Share option plans It is assumed that 10% of option holders are forced to exercise their options each year irrespective of the level of the share price.
For the remainder it is assumed that half will exercise their options each year if the share price is at least 15% above the exercise price.
Allowance for performance conditions The long term incentive plan includes a market based performance condition based on the Groups total shareholder return relative to an index of comparator companies.
The impact of this performance condition has been modelled using Monte Carlo Simulation techniques, which involves running several thousands of simulations of future share price movements for both the Group and the comparator index.
For the purpose of these simulations it is assumed that the share price of the Group and the comparator index are 70% correlated and that the comparator index has volatility of 40% p. a.
The performance condition is based on the Groups performance relative to the comparator index over a three year period commencing on 1 January each year.
The fair value calculations for the awards that were made in 2004 and 2005 therefore include an allowance for the actual performance of the Groups share price relative to the index over the period between 1 January and the award date.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets continued Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of companies and other businesses.
It is subject to a six monthly impairment review by comparing the value in use with the carrying value.
When this indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable it is written down through the income statement.
The goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the acquisitions concerned.
In most cases, the cash-generating units represent the actual company or business acquired.
Goodwill can be analysed on a divisional basis as follows: 2005 2004 m m Retail 426 426 Corporate 42 42 Insurance & Investment 853 853 Treasury & Asset Management 39 39 International 306 311 Total 1,666 1,671 The recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit is based upon value in use calculations.
The calculations use cash flow projections based upon the five year business plan with cash flows thereafter being extrapolated using growth rates in the range of 2.25% to 2.50% reflecting the long term nature of the businesses concerned and the long term trend in growth rate of the respective economy.
The pre-tax discount rates used in discounting projected cash flows lie in the range of 10% to 12.2%.

The economic assumptions that have the greatest effect on the calculation of the value of in-force Long Term Assurance Business are set out below.
These assumptions require the application of material judgement and are chosen to represent a long term view of the likely economic environment.
The experience assumptions set out in Note 25 also have a significant effect on the cash flow projections.
The selection of these assumptions also requires the application of material judgement and is made with reference to historic trends, taking into account the analysis of actual versus expected experience as well as industry data.
Additional information on the Long Term Assurance Business risk is set out on pages 59 to 60 of the Risk Management report.
Risk discount rate The risk discount rate, the rate used to calculate the present value of the future projected cash flows, is based on the long term view of the risk free rate of return.
As a long term view, it necessarily involves the application of judgement.
This is increased to reflect the uncertainty associated with the projected cash flows.
This increase can be broken down into two principal components, being the investment risk component and the insurance risk component.
The investment risk component represents an allowance for uncertainty as to the level of future margins that will actually be achieved by the Groups investments.
The level of addition is chosen so as to avoid capitalising any investment risk premiums over the long term view of the risk free rate of return.
The insurance risk component represents an additional allowance in the risk discount rate to reflect the potential volatility of, and uncertainty around, the future level of insurance risk inherent in the contracts.

Value of In-Force Long Term Assurance Business continued The breakdown of the risk discount rate is shown in the table below: 2005 2004 % % Long term view of risk free rate of return 5.0 5.0 Investment risk component 1.0 1.0 Insurance risk component 2.0 2.0 Total 8.0 8.0 In isolation of any other assumption changes, an increase in the risk discount rate would result in a decrease in the value of in-force Long Term Assurance Business reducing profits and vice versa.
Investment return Assumptions are set for each individual asset class based on the long term view of expected returns, and weighted to produce an investment return assumption for each particular class of business.
The weighting is based on the long term asset allocation strategy for each class of business.
The table below sets out the long term view of the expected returns for each asset class: 2005 2004 % % Return on fixed interest securities 5.0 - 5.5 5.0 - 5.5 Return on equities 7.5 7.5 In isolation, an increase in the investment return assumption would lead to an increase in profits, and vice versa.
Expenses Operating expense assumptions reflect the projected costs of maintaining and servicing in-force insurance contracts and investment contracts with DPF and associated overhead expenses.
The current level of expenses is taken as an appropriate expense base.
The current expenses are analysed having regard to the volume and type of business in force to derive per contract expense assumptions.
These per policy expense assumptions are assumed to increase over the course of the projections in line with an assumed expense inflation rate of 3% 2004 3%.
Changes in assumptions There were no significant changes in the economic assumptions during 2005 used in the derivation of the value of in-force Long Term Assurance Business.
However, there were a number of changes to the underlying experience assumptions used to estimate the cash flows from the Long Term Assurance Business.
These are discussed further in Note 25.

It should also be noted that in some instances these sensitivities are non-linear.

Insurance Contract Liabilities continued Long Term Insurance Contract Liabilities The Group principally writes the following long term contracts which contain insurance risk: Life assurance - The policyholder is insured against death or permanent disability usually for pre-determined amounts principally mortality and disability risk.
Annuity products - The policyholder is entitled to payments for the duration of their life and is therefore insured for living longer than expected principally longevity and market risk.
Traditional with-profit business - The primary purpose of these products is to provide a long term smoothed investment vehicle to the policyholder, protecting them against short term market fluctuations.
The policyholder is also usually insured against death and the policy may carry an annuity option at maturity principally market risk.
Unitised business - The primary purpose of these products is to provide an investment vehicle but where the policyholder is also insured against death principally market risk.
The table below sets out the extent of the above exposures based on the carrying value of the liabilities: 2005 Insurance Insurance Total Less Net contracts contracts insurance reinsurers contract within the within the contract share of liabilities non-profit with-profit liabilities contract funds fund liabilities m m m m m Life assurance 508 508 508 Annuity products 2,026 2,026 2,026 Traditional with profits 2,154 2,154 2,154 Unitised business 12,313 4,090 16,403 91 16,312 Other 57 57 1 56 Total 14,904 6,244 21,148 92 21,056 Guarantees and options The products with the most significant guarantees and options are: certain with-profit bonds which allow surrenders at specified dates without market value adjustments being applied and withdrawals to be taken without penalty: certain contracts which provide guaranteed minimum levels of return on policyholder contributions made to the contract: and certain pension contracts containing an option that allows the policyholder to take an annuity benefit at any time between their 60th and 75th birthday on annuity rates that were guaranteed at the outset of the contract.
There are no other material guarantees and options within the Long Term Assurance Business other than those discussed above.
For contracts where there are guarantees and options the most significant factor in determining the cost of the guarantees and options other than economic conditions in which the option or guarantee has value is the actual take up rate of options.
The most significant factor in determining take up rates is customer behaviour which is influenced by a number of factors including the value of the contract, general awareness of financial matters and the quality of the advice they obtain.
The financial impact is dependent on the value of corresponding investments, interest rates and longevity at the time of the claim.
In order to measure the risk of these guarantees the Group makes use of statistical modelling techniques where appropriate to determine the possible and most likely range of outcomes.
To help mitigate the risks the Group makes use of matching techniques in order to hedge part of the expected cash flows arising under the guarantees in these contracts with financial instruments.

Insurance Contract Liabilities continued Experience and valuation rates of interest assumptions The assumptions used in the measurement of insurance liabilities are determined by the Board of Directors.
Material judgement is required in the choice of assumptions relating to insurance contracts.
The assumptions that have the greatest effect on the measurement of the insurance contract liabilities are set out by type of business below.
Mortality and longevity rates The process used to determine the Groups mortality and longevity assumptions starts with an internal investigation of the Groups actual mortality experience over the last five years.
This investigation is updated regularly.
The results of this investigation are considered in the context of a number of factors including the credibility of the results which will be affected by the volume of data available, any exceptional events that have occurred during the period being considered, any known or expected trends in underlying data and relevant published market data.
The rates derived from the Groups experience are adjusted in the light of the factors mentioned above to derive a set of best estimate rates.
No deliberate margins for prudence are introduced as part of this process.
These best estimate assumptions will be used in the projection of best estimate cash flows, such as the measurement of the value of in-force Long Term Assurance Business.
For insurance contracts within the non-profit funds, the liabilities are assessed on a prudent basis and hence the rates used need to include a margin for adverse deviation that will increase liabilities and provide some protection from the risk that actual experience is worse than the best estimate assumptions.
For insurance contracts within the with-profit fund, the liabilities are required to be determined using the realistic or best estimate assumptions.
2005 2004 Non-profit policies Pension annuities Males 95% PM92 mc 95% PM92 mc Females 80% PFA92 75%mc 80% PFA92 Term assurances Males 43% - 145% TM92 43% - 145% TM92 Females 55% - 160% TF92 55% - 160% TF92 Unit-linked policies Life assurance and pensions 60% - 150% AM92 AF92 70% - 150% AM92 AF92 With-profit policies Life assurance and pensions 60% - 100% AM92 AF92 70% - 100% AM92 AF92 For life assurance policies, increased mortality rates would lead to a larger number of claims and claims occurring sooner than anticipated, increasing the expenditure and reducing profits.
For annuity contracts, the opposite is true.
Annual Report and HBOSplc Accounts 2005 135 309467 101-180 13 3 06 16:33 Page 136 Notes to the Accounts continued 25.
Insurance Contract Liabilities continued Lapse and surrender rates persistency A lapse occurs when the termination of a contract results from the non-payment of premiums due under that contract.
A surrender occurs when a policyholder decides to voluntarily terminate their contract.
Paid-up and partial surrender are additional forms of lapse and surrender.
The process used to determine contract lapse and surrender rates is similar to that used to determine mortality and longevity rates.
The previous experience of the Group over the preceding three years is analysed using statistical techniques.
As the experience can vary considerably between different product types and for contracts which have been in force for different periods, the internal analysis breaks the data down into broadly homogeneous groups for the purposes of this analysis.
This analysis is updated regularly.
The most recent experience is considered along with the results of previous analyses in order to determine a best estimate view of what persistency experience will be in the future.
In determining this best estimate view, a number of factors are considered including the credibility of the results which will be affected by the volume of data available, any exceptional events that have occurred during the period being considered, any known or expected trends in underlying data and relevant published market data.
For insurance contracts within the non-profit funds the liabilities are calculated assuming a prudent worst case scenario.
That is, that no lapses are assumed to occur unless doing so would increase the liabilities.
For insurance contracts within the withprofit fund, the liabilities are required to be determined using the realistic or best estimate assumptions.
Lapse and surrender rates vary according to both contract type and the length of time a contract has been in force.
No lapse and surrender rates have been presented because it is impractical to summarise the information in a meaningful manner.
The impact of an increase in lapse and surrender rates on contracts without guarantees and options would most likely result in a decrease in profits, as the contracts would no longer be in force to generate cash flows in the future.
However, for certain policies with valuable guarantees and options principally within the with-profit fund, increased lapse and surrender rates may be beneficial to the Group as the policyholder loses the ability to exercise the potentially valuable guarantee or option when their policy terminates.
Valuation rate of interest The valuation rate of interest is the rate used to discount the projected cash flows on the contracts in order to determine the value of the liabilities as at the reporting date.
For insurance contracts within the non-profit funds, the liabilities are calculated using a prudent valuation rate of interest determined according to specific rules set out by the Financial Services Authority.
These rules specify that the valuation rate of interest should be set by reference to a prudent estimate of the future yield on the assets of the fund with an additional prudent margin being taken to allow for future investment risk.
For insurance contracts within the with-profit fund, the liabilities are calculated using a realistic or market consistent valuation rate of interest based on the prevailing economic conditions at the time of the liability assessment without further adjustment.
2005 2004 Non-profit policies Pension annuities 4.0% 4.75% Term assurances 2.6% - 3.5% 2.6% - 4.0% Unit-linked policies Life assurance 2.6% - 3.5% 2.8% - 4.0% Pensions 3.25% - 3.5% 3.25% - 4.0% In isolation an increase in the valuation rate of interest decreases liabilities leading to a increase in profits or vice versa.
Discretionary participating bonus rates The distributions to the insurance and investment contracts with DPF policyholders are determined by the Board of Directors of subsidiaries based on local regulations and in line with arrangements in individual policy contracts.
For insurance and investment contracts with DPF in the with-profit fund the distributions to policyholders are governed by the funds Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM.
No material changes were made to the distribution policies for insurance and investment contracts with DPF during the year under review.
Changes in experience and valuation rate of interest assumptions There were a number of changes made to assumptions used to calculate the value of policyholder liabilities.
The most significant changes to the liability valuations, none of which were individually significant, were: valuation rates of interest were updated to reflect the prevailing economic conditions at the balance sheet date: and experience assumptions were updated to reflect the impact that the recent experience of the Group had had on managements long term view of likely future experience.

The provisions are refined as part of a regular ongoing process as claims experience develops, certain claims are settled and further claims are reported.
Outstanding claims provisions are not discounted for the time value of money.
The measurement process primarily includes projection of future claims costs through a combination of actuarial and statistical projection techniques.
In certain cases, where there is a lack of reliable historical data on which to estimate claims development, relevant benchmarks of similar business are used in developing claims estimates.
The principal assumption underlying the estimates is the general insurance businesss past claims development experience.
This includes assumptions in respect of average claims costs, claims handling costs, claims inflation factors, and claim numbers for each accident year.
Judgement is used to assess the extent to which external factors such as judicial decisions and government legislation affect the estimates.

Unallocated Surplus 2005 m Unallocated surplus 974 The nature of certain insurance and investment contracts with DPF within the with-profit fund is such that the allocation of the surplus assets between the policyholder and the Group has not been determined at the end of the accounting period.
The unallocated surplus comprises these surplus assets and is deemed to be a liability until allocation to the appropriate party has been determined.
In accordance with the requirements of FRS 27, the best estimate of the Groups share of future bonuses has been recognised as part of the unallocated surplus.

Long Term Assurance Business Capital Position Statement continued The Group has one UK with-profit fund, the Clerical Medical Investment Group Limited CMIGL with-profit fund, which is shown separately in the Capital Position Statement.
The Groups UK non-profit businesses are aggregated as well as the Groups overseas life businesses for the purpose of this statement.
For the Groups UK with-profit fund, available capital and capital requirements are determined under the twin peaks assessment as prescribed by the regulations of the Financial Services Authority FSA.
Under this assessment the available capital is determined by comparing admissible assets with the mathematical reserves determined on the regulatory peak basis.
The capital requirement consists of three components, namely the resilience capital requirement, the long term insurance capital requirement and the with-profit insurance capital component WPICC.
It is the latter which is determined under the twin peaks test by comparing the regulatory peak with the realistic peak.
If the latter is more onerous then this gives rise to a WPICC.
At 31 December 2005 the realistic peak was more onerous.
As at 31 December 2004 it was the regulatory peak.
This change was due to the strong investment performance achieved during 2005.
As more fully described in Note 27 the unallocated surplus is determined on a realistic basis in accordance with FRS 27.
However, to determine the available capital this has to be adjusted onto a regulatory peak basis as explained above and this is shown explicitly in the Capital Position Statement.
UK shareholders funds, UK non-profit funds and overseas businesses are shown separately in the Capital Position Statement.
There are no formal arrangements, other than those relating to the CMIGL with-profit fund described below, for shareholders funds or the surplus within the individual life funds to be used to support other businesses or life funds within the Group.
However, as described below, subject to certain conditions being met, the available capital within the individual funds is potentially transferable to other parts of the Group.
However, the capital within each fund is generally subject to restrictions as to its availability to meet requirements that arise elsewhere in the Group, including other long term businesses.
In particular, for sections in the Capital Position Statement where aggregate capital amounts have been shown, such as for UK non-profit funds and overseas business, there are no prior arrangements in place to allow the capital to move freely between entities within these sections.
Restrictions to the application of capital Restrictions apply to the transfer of assets from any long term fund.
In particular, at all times, each long term fund must maintain an excess of assets over liabilities.
Transfers of assets from a long term fund can only be made once management are satisfied that they have met the relevant requirements of the fund.
The principal restrictions are: a CMIGL with-profit fund The unallocated surplus held in the fund can only be applied to meet the requirements of the fund itself or distributed according to the prescribed rules of the fund.
Shareholders are entitled to an amount not exceeding one ninth of the amount distributed to policyholders in the form of bonuses.
Such distributions would also be subject to a tax charge.
The use of capital within the fund is also subject to the terms of the scheme of demutualisation effected in 1996 and the conditions contained in the Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM of the fund.
Capital within the Clerical Medical non-profit fund is available to meet the with-profit funds capital requirements.
There are no other arrangements that provide capital support to the fund.
b UK non-profit funds Except as above, the capital held in the fund is attributable to the shareholders and, subject to meeting the regulatory requirements of these businesses, this capital is potentially available to meet capital requirements elsewhere in the Group.
Any transfer of the surplus would give rise to a tax charge.
c Overseas life business These include several smaller life companies outside the UK.
In all cases the available capital resources are subject to local regulatory requirements including Germany, Ireland and Australia.
The available capital held in each company is potentially available to meet the capital requirements in other parts of the Group, subject to additional complexity surrounding the transfer of capital from one country to another.

Long Term Assurance Business Capital Position Statement continued Target capital For the UK with-profit fund the Group is required to hold sufficient capital to meet FSA requirements, based on the risk capital margin RCM determined in accordance with the FSAs regulatory rules under its realistic capital regime.
The determination of the RCM is based on the impact of specified changes in market prices of the fund assets as well as policyholder behaviour, taking into account the actions management would have taken in the event of the particular adverse changes.
For UK non-profit business, the relevant capital requirement is the long term insurance capital requirement LTICR and resilience capital requirement RCR determined in accordance with FSA regulations.
Under the FSAs Individual Capital Adequacy Standards ICAS framework, each company is required to carry out its own assessment of the capital required to meet its liabilities in all reasonably foreseeable circumstances known as the individual capital assessment ICA.
The ICA takes into account certain business risks not reflected in the FSAs other capital requirements.
Management intends to maintain surplus capital in excess of the various regulatory requirements, including the ICA, in order to absorb changes in both the underlying businesses and the capital requirements over the short term.
At 31 December 2005 the available capital was 207% 2004 224% of the provisional capital requirements of 2,136m 2004 1,380m.
Changes in capital The principal factors that resulted in changes to the total available capital between 2004 and 2005 are described below: a Changes in assumptions There were a number of changes made to assumptions used to calculate the value of policyholder liabilities.
The most significant changes were: valuation rates of interest were updated to reflect the prevailing economic conditions at the balance sheet date: and non-economic assumptions were updated to reflect the impact that the recent experience of the Group had had on managements long term view of likely future experience.
b Investment markets Improved market conditions led to a significant increase in the value of securities resulting in an increase to the total capital available.
c Management policy There were no changes to management policy that affected capital.
d Changes in regulatory requirements There were no material changes in regulatory requirements.
However, the move to reporting on an IFRS basis resulted in changes to the shareholder funds.
e New business The amount of capital has been reduced by the increase in liabilities and new business strain excess of acquisition costs over margins due to significant volumes of new Long Term Assurance Business written since the last balance sheet date.
f Existing business Surplus has emerged on existing in-force blocks of business which has resulted in an increase in the total capital available.
g Acquisitions As set out in Note 49 the Group acquired MLP Lebensversicherung AG renamed Heidelberger Leben increasing total capital available by 66m.
h Other In June 2005 Clerical Medical Finance plc issued an additional 494m of subordinated debt.
This liability remains within the shareholder funds whereas the assets purchased were invested in the non-profit funds in order to provide capital support.
The fair value of the liability to the shareholder at 31 December 2005 is 518m.
There are no other significant changes to capital.

Derivatives The Group uses interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and other derivative instruments to hedge and reduce the interest rate and currency exposures that are inherent in any banking business.
The hedge accounting strategy adopted by the Group is to utilise a combination of the macro cash flow, micro fair value and net investment hedge approaches.
Some derivatives held for economic hedging purposes do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting as defined under IAS 39 and therefore are accounted for in the same way as derivatives held for trading.
The Group has entered into derivative contracts as noted below.
The notional principal amounts represent the value of the contract to which the derivative relates and are provided to assist the comparison with the financial instrument values on the balance sheet.

Hedges In line with the requirements of IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards the following hedging table for 2004 has been disclosed as reported under the previous GAAP.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair values of financial instruments are based on market prices where available, or are estimated using other valuation techniques.
Where they are short term in nature or reprice frequently, fair value approximates to carrying value.
The fair value information presented does not represent the fair value of the Group as a going concern at 31 December 2004 or 31 December 2005.
The classification adopted by the Group is shown in the following table: 2005 At fair value Available Loans and through for sale receivables the income statement Carrying Fair value Carrying Fair value Carrying Fair value amount amount amount m m m m m m Assets Financial assets held for trading 41,766 41,766 Derivative assets 10,499 10,499 Loans and advances to banks 3,056 3,056 14,300 14,377 Loans and advances to customers 343,768 345,728 Investment securities 61,619 61,619 41,927 41,927 788 1,212 116,940 116,940 41,927 41,927 358,856 361,317 2005 At fair value Financial through liabilities at the income amortised statement cost Carrying Fair value Carrying Fair value amount amount m m m m Liabilities Deposits by banks 2 2 32,039 32,031 Customer accounts 200,948 201,598 Financial liabilities held for trading 25,007 25,007 Derivative liabilities 8,576 8,576 Investment contract liabilities 31,466 31,466 Debt securities in issue 1,243 1,243 156,718 156,939 Other borrowed funds 120 120 20,134 22,392 66,414 66,414 409,839 412,960 Investment contracts exclude investment contracts classified as investment contracts with DPF.
Main methodologies and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through the income statement The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices.
Where there is no active market, fair value is established using valuation techniques.
Where current prices are not available, the price of the most recent transaction provides evidence of the current fair value, adjusted for changes in economic circumstances.
Valuation techniques also include the use of recent market transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
Derivatives Derivative fair values are determined by using valuation techniques that are consistent with techniques commonly used by market participants to price these instruments.
These techniques include discounted cash flow analysis and other pricing models.
The fair values calculated from these models are regularly compared with prices obtained in actual market transactions to ensure reliability.
In all material instances these techniques use only observable market data.
Loans and advances to customers The fair value of loans and advances is estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows, including interest, at a current market rate of interest.
Loans and advances to banks and deposits by banks The fair value of floating rate placements and overnight deposits is equal to carrying value.
The fair value of fixed interest bearing deposits is based on cash flows discounted using current money market interest rates for debts with similar maturity and credit risk characteristics.
HBOSplc Annual Report and 156 Accounts 2005 309467 101-180 13 3 06 10:40 pm Page 157 Notes to the Accounts continued 42.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments continued Customer deposits and borrowings The fair value of customer deposits with no stated maturity date is the amount repayable on demand.
The estimated fair value of fixed interestbearing deposits and other borrowings with no quoted market price is calculated using a cash flow model discounted using interest rates for debts with similar maturity.
Investment securities Fair value is based on market prices or broker dealer valuations.
Where this information is not available, fair value has been estimated using quoted market prices for securities with similar credit, maturity and yield characteristics.
Debt securities in issue Fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices.
Where quoted market prices are not available, a cash flow model is used discounted using an appropriate current yield curve for the remaining term to maturity.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 2004 In line with the requirements of IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards the following fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities table for 2004 is disclosed as reported under the previous GAAP.
For the table below the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are based on market prices where available, or are estimated using other valuation techniques.
Derivatives held for trading purposes as disclosed in Note 40 on pages 152 to 155 are carried at fair value.
Derivatives held for non-trading purposes are accounted for in the same way as the underlying transaction being hedged.
Fair values are based on market prices where available, or are estimated using other valuation techniques.
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities analysed between trading and non-trading: 2004 Assets Liabilities Carrying Fair value Carrying Fair value amount amount m m m m Non-trading Treasury bills and other eligible bills 3,705 3,704 Debt securities 38,087 38,292 Equity shares 208 326 Debt securities in issue 105,181 106,303 Dated loan capital 8,232 8,936 Undated loan capital 6,401 7,007 Preference shares 400 628 Minority and other interests non-equity 2,617 2,990 Derivatives 486 1,874 415 3,713 42,486 44,196 123,246 129,577 Trading Treasury bills and other eligible bills 622 622 Loans and advances to banks 2,513 2,513 Loans and advances to customers 1,776 1,776 Debt securities 21,220 21,220 Other assets 62 62 Debt securities in issue 729 729 Deposits by banks 5,206 5,206 Customer accounts 9,481 9,481 Other liabilities 107 107 Derivatives 6,109 6,109 6,423 6,423 32,302 32,302 21,946 21,946 Fair values in respect of non-trading financial assets and liabilities are disclosed only where there is a liquid and active market.

Revenue on certain financial instruments is recognised using the effective interest rate basis under which income and expenses are spread over their expected life.
The calculation of effective interest rate requires the estimation of future cash flows and of the expected life of the financial instrument.
Models used in these calculations are continually reassessed for appropriateness of assumptions.

Interest Rate Sensitivity Gap The table below summarises the repricing profiles of the Groups assets and liabilities.
However, the expected cashflows underlying the valuations are not directly subject to interest rate risks.
Accordingly, these balances have been included in non-interest bearing items in the table above.
The sensitivity of the Group to changes in interest rates related to long term insurance and investment contracts is set out in Note 23.
Assets and liabilities associated with policyholder funds and consolidated collective investment schemes shown in Note 48 have been excluded from the repricing profile in the above table.
This is on the basis that the underlying interest rate risks inherent in the net assets of the funds are matched by the policyholder liabilities, limiting the impact of these risks on the Group results.
Excluded from the above table are the carrying amounts of derivative financial instruments and financial assets and liabilities held for trading.
The notional principal amounts associated with those derivatives which are used to reduce the Groups exposure to interest rate movements are shown as part of net hedging derivatives.
This includes derivatives held for economic hedging purposes which are not in formal hedge accounting relationships.
The estimated potential loss arising from the Groups exposure to interest rate risk from the Groups trading activities is shown in Note 45 Trading Value at Risk.
Additional information on the methodology adopted by the Group is given on page 57 of the Risk Management report.

Trading Value at Risk The Groups Value at Risk VaR methodology of estimating potential losses arising from the Groups exposure to market risk is explained on page 58 of the Risk Management report.
The Groups trading market risk exposure for the year ended 31 December 2005 is analysed below.

Interest rate risk relating to the trading book is principally managed using a sensitivity methodology to measure exposure and set limits.
This methodology calculates the present value impact of a one basis point parallel movement in interest rates on the outstanding positions.
Foreign exchange risk is principally managed by the use of position limits.
Non-trading Currency Exposure Structural currency exposures arise from the Groups investments in overseas subsidiaries, branches and other investments and are noted in the table below.

Maturity Analysis of Assets and Liabilities The table below breaks down the Groups financial assets and liabilities by remaining contractual maturity.
The maturity profile for those assets and liabilities defined as financial have been determined in accordance with groupings that are considered most appropriate for those particular assets and liabilities.
The remaining assets and liabilities have been split between those considered to be current and non-current.
This is on the basis that the underlying liquidity risks are for the account of the policyholders and have no direct impact on the Group results.
The expected maturities of these assets and liabilities are shown on the following page.
Of the 16bn remaining non-policyholder assets, 5bn is considered to be current.
Similarly of the 11bn remaining non-policyholder liabilities, 8bn is considered to be current.

Acquisitions On 17 June 2005, the Group announced the purchase from MLP AG of the entire in-force business of MLP Lebensversicherung AG renamed Heidelberger Leben for 283m in cash with a potential adjustment of plus or minus 15m subject to persistency targets being met over the period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2007 and up to a further 40m being payable upon delivery of the Heidelberger Leben business plan during the years 2005 to 2008 inclusive.
Any deferred consideration payable will be paid in cash.
In addition, the Group has entered into a long term strategic partnership with MLP AGs distribution arm MLP FDL to increase the sale of the Groups continental insurance products in Germany.
The effective date of acquisition was 1 July 2005.
The fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired amounted to 218m which is approximately equal to the value of consideration paid, contingent consideration accrued and directly attributable costs incurred.
The post-acquisition profit before tax of Heidelberger Leben included in the Groups consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2005 is 39m.

Notes to the analysis of the Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Equity Impact Detailed below are supplementary notes that provide explanations of the income statement and balance sheet reclassifications and the equity impact to reserves as a result of the transition to IFRS.
The explanations have been split between excluding and including IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4 to support the respective balance sheets and income statement in Notes 54, 55 and 56.
IFRS Adjustments - Excluding IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4 a Long Term Assurance Business Reclassification Under UK GAAP in the Group income statement and balance sheet, Long Term Assurance Business has historically only been reported through the following line items: - Income from Long Term Assurance Business - Long Term Assurance Business attributable to shareholders shareholder net assets attributable to Long Term Assurance Business and the Value of In-Force VIF Long Term Assurance Business - Long Term Assurance Business assets attributable to policyholders - Long Term Assurance Business liabilities attributable to policyholders - Retained earnings, which includes the accumulated embedded value profit.
Under IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements a line by line presentation is required for those Long Term Assurance Business amounts included within the Groups income statement and balance sheet.
The main components of the income statement reclassification prior to the adoption of IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4 are: Income from Long Term Assurance Business This has been split out on a line by line basis with the largest component being allocated to net earned premiums on insurance contracts and other operating income.
The main components of the balance sheet reclassification prior to the adoption of IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4 are: Long Term Assurance Business attributable to shareholders This has been split into two components namely shareholder net assets and VIF.
Shareholder net assets have been re-analysed across a number of other balance sheet categories, while the VIF asset has been reclassified to a new line Value of in-force Long Term Assurance Business.
Long Term Assurance Business assets attributable to policyholders This has been split out on a line by line basis with the largest components being allocated to investment securities.
Long Term Assurance Business liabilities attributable to policyholders This has been split out on a line by line basis with the majority being classified as insurance contract liabilities.
b Leasing Finance leases Under UK GAAP, the Group held finance lease assets on balance sheet within loans and advances to customers at an amount equal to the net cash investment in the lease after making provisions for items such as bad and doubtful rentals receivable.
The total gross earnings under finance leases were allocated to accounting periods to give a constant periodic rate of return to the lessors net cash investment outstanding in respect of the lease.
Under IFRS the total gross earnings are allocated to accounting periods using an actuarial pre-tax methodology to give a constant rate of return on the net investment.
Operating leases For operating leases, rental income continues to be recognised on a straight-line basis.
However, the calculation of depreciation on operating lease assets has changed from a post-tax actuarial method to a straight-line pre-tax basis.
This is to ensure that the depreciation profile matches that of similar assets used by the Group.
HBOSplc Annual Report and 176 Accounts 2005 309467 101-180 13 3 06 11:26 Page 177 Notes to the Accounts continued 57.
Notes to the analysis of the Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Equity Impact continued c Interests in Jointly Controlled Entities JCEs and Associated Undertakings Interests in JCEs and associated undertakings follow the provisions of IAS 28 and IAS 31 respectively using the equity accounting method.
Jointly controlled entities Under UK GAAP, interests in jointly controlled entities were also accounted for using the equity accounting method.
IFRS requires investments in debt securities issued by the JCEs to be disclosed separately from the underlying carrying value of these entities.
This resulted in a reclassification of debt securities to investment securities.
In addition under IFRS losses are restricted to a level that reflects an obligation to fund such losses, whereas under UK GAAP losses were taken beyond this level.
Associated undertakings The definition of an associate differs under IFRS from UK GAAP and therefore the scope of what can and cannot be included has changed.
In addition under UK GAAP the carrying value of associates includes any preference shares or loan stock held by the Group relating to those entities.
Following the introduction of IFRS these debt securities are disclosed separately from the underlying carrying value of those entities.
This results in a reclassification from interests in associated undertakings to debt securities.
d Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Under UK GAAP goodwill was capitalised and amortised by equal instalments over its estimated useful life, not exceeding 20 years.
Goodwill was subject to an impairment review when a change in circumstances indicated the carrying amount may not have been recoverable.
Under IFRS impairment reviews for intangible assets are undertaken six monthly.
Goodwill amortisation is prohibited under IFRS.
Software development costs are capitalised in line with the accounting policy and have been reclassified from property and equipment to goodwill and other intangible assets.
Amortisation is carried out on the same basis as under UK GAAP.
e Investment Properties The reclassification of Long Term Assurance Business assets gives rise to the separate identification of investment properties.
Additionally, changes have resulted from certain subsidiaries that have been funded for the purpose of property development.
At a consolidated level under UK GAAP, the costs of property development were treated as loans and advances to customers as the substance of the transactions is that of lending.
However under IFRS the classification of the transaction must follow the treatment within the individual subsidiary accounts and therefore requires a reclassification from loans and advances to customers.
f Dividends Paid and Payable Under UK GAAP dividends were recognised in the period to which they related.
Under IFRS ordinary dividends paid in the year in respect of equity instruments are not included in the income statement, but are recognised directly in the retained earnings reserve.
In addition, under IFRS the Group does not recognise ordinary dividends that have been declared or proposed after the balance sheet date.
The liability for outstanding distributions on preference securities at the balance sheet date relates to the Groups contractual obligation to pay distributions on these preference securities.
g Net Post Retirement Benefit Liabilities Under UK GAAP the cost of providing retirement pension and related benefits was charged against profits on a systematic basis over employee service lives.
Under IAS 19, defined benefit pension schemes and other Post Retirement benefit plans are recognised on balance sheet and represent the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they arise within the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense SORIE.
In addition, under UK GAAP, assets were valued based on mid price while IAS 19 via IAS 39 requires all assets to be valued on a bid price basis as of 1 January 2005.
The Group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses for all Group defined benefit schemes in opening equity at 1 January 2004 on transition to IFRS.
h Own Shares Own shares were held as a reduction from other reserves under UK GAAP.
Following the introduction of IFRS, own shares are held as part of retained earnings.

Notes to the analysis of the Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Equity Impact continued IFRS Adjustments - Including IAS 32, IAS 39, IFRS 4 and FRS 27 IAS 39 Financial asset and liability classification IAS 39 established specific categories into which all financial assets and liabilities must be classified.
The classification of financial instruments dictates how these assets and liabilities are subsequently measured in the financial statements.
There are four categories of financial assets: assets at fair value through the income statement, available for sale, loans and receivables and held to maturity and two categories of financial liabilities: liabilities at fair value through the income statement and liabilities at amortised cost.
Assets at fair value through the income statement These assets are carried at fair value with changes in fair value taken to the income statement.
This category includes assets held for trading where they are held for the purpose of selling in the short term or as investments that are held to meet insurance policyholder liabilities.
Available for sale AFS These are non-derivative financial assets designated on initial recognition as available for sale.
AFS assets are measured at fair value on the balance sheet.
Fair value changes of AFS assets are recognised directly in equity, through the SORIE, except for interest on AFS assets which is recognised in income on an effective interest rate basis, impairment losses and for interest-bearing AFS debt instruments foreign exchange gains or losses.
The cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement when an AFS financial asset is derecognised.
Loans and receivables These are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments, originated or acquired, that are not quoted in an active market, not held for trading and not designated on initial recognition as assets at fair value through the income statement or as AFS.
Investment debt securities that are not quoted on an active market are categorised as loans and receivables.
Held to maturity The Group has no investment securities designated under this category.
Liabilities at fair value through the income statement Such liabilities are held at fair value with changes in fair value taken to the income statement.
This category includes liabilities held for trading where they are held for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Financial liabilities at amortised cost Financial liabilities at amortised cost include deposits by banks, customer accounts, other borrowed funds and debt securities in issue.
Effective Interest Rate Revenue on financial instruments classified as loans and receivables, available for sale or financial liabilities at amortised cost is recognised on an effective interest rate basis.
This calculation takes into account interest received or paid and fees and commissions received or paid that are integral to the yield as well as incremental transaction costs.
The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the expected future cash flows over the expected life of the financial instrument or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial instrument at initial recognition.
i Long Term Assurance Business The introduction of IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4 results in three principal reclassifications: Under UK GAAP income from Long Term Assurance Business was accounted for using the embedded value basis.
Under IFRS 4, Long Term Assurance Business contracts which do not contain significant insurance risk are reclassified and accounted for as investment contracts.
It is no longer allowable to recognise VIF with respect to investment contracts.
Where VIF is internally generated it is written off.
However, Purchased Value of In-Force PVIF remains allowable provided it is reclassified as an intangible asset.
This has led to a reclassification from VIF to goodwill and other intangible assets.
The introduction of FRS 27 results in the unallocated surplus, determined on a realistic basis as described in Note 27, being reallocated from insurance contract liabilities and separately disclosed on the face of the balance sheet.

Notes to the analysis of the Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Equity Impact continued j Investment Securities Under UK GAAP debt securities and other fixed interest securities held for trading were included at market value with gains or losses included in dealing profits.
Debt securities and other fixed interest securities held for the longer term and equity securities were included at cost less amounts written off, adjusted for the amortisation of premiums or discounts arising on the purchase of investments redeemable at fixed dates.
Gains or losses on disposal of such investment securities were recognised in other operating income as they arose and premiums and discounts taken to interest receivable on a straight line basis over the period to redemption.
Income from listed equity shares was credited to other operating income on the ex-dividend date and on an equivalent basis for unlisted equity.
Under IFRS both equity shares and debt securities are included within investment securities.
k Loans and Advances Under UK GAAP loans and advances were held at cost less provisions.
Under IFRS loans and advances are held at amortised cost with revenue recognised on an effective interest rate basis.
The non-returnable finance on securitised customer advances that met the criteria for linked presentation in accordance with the UK Financial Reporting Standard FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions is classified as debt securities in issue from 1 January 2005.
The opening IFRS adjustment to reserves in respect of impairment reflects the net impact of moving to a narrower interpretation of an incurred loss model which recognises recoverable cash flows by applying a discount rate based on the loans effective interest rate.
l Derivatives Hedge Accounting Hedging the Groups exposures to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk is undertaken in the normal course of business using derivatives.
This activity is principally carried out in Treasury within a risk management framework of limits, practices and procedures set and overseen by the Group Market Risk Committee formerly the HBOS Group Asset and Liability Committee.
Under UK GAAP trading derivatives were carried in the accounts at fair value with gains or losses included in net trading income.
Non-trading derivatives were accounted for on the same basis as the underlying items being hedged.
IAS 39 requires all derivatives to be recorded on balance sheet at fair value with any movements in fair value taken to the income statement as they arise.
Given that fair values will fluctuate, these movements will create volatility in reserves and the income statement.
Only in circumstances where hedge accounting for derivatives is employed will the income statement be protected from this volatility.
The hedge accounting strategy being adopted by the Group is to utilise a combination of both the macro cash flow and micro fair value hedge approaches.
In the case of the macro cash flow approach, the hedging derivative is measured at fair value with any movement taken to reserves.
The underlying hedged item is accounted for in accordance with the policy for that financial instrument and no fair value accounting entries are required of the underlying hedged item.
This approach gives rise to volatility in reserves, but protects the income statement to the extent the hedge is effective.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The micro fair value approach requires that the hedging derivative is measured at fair value with movements recognised in the income statement, rather than reserves.
The designated hedged item is also adjusted by the change in fair value in relation to the risk being hedged and that change is also recognised through the income statement.
Therefore, if the hedge is fully effective, postings to the income statement will be equal and opposite.
m Other borrowed funds Other borrowed funds is a new balance sheet line item under IFRS, which comprises preference shares that are classified as debt, preferred securities and subordinated liabilities, all of which are held at amortised cost.
The IFRS definition of debt includes instruments with a contractual obligation to pay interest or principal.
This has resulted in a reclassification of certain funding instruments shown within capital and reserves under UK GAAP to other borrowed funds as explained below.
Preference shares now classified as debt Non-equity preference shares previously shown under capital and reserves are reclassified as other liabilities and disclosed as other borrowings where they are redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the shareholders or if dividend payments are not discretionary.
Dividends on such preference shares are recognised in the income statement through interest payable on an effective interest rate basis.
Preferred securities The most significant reclassification is in respect of non-equity minority interests including innovative Tier 1 securities where interest payments are not discretionary.
These were shown within capital and reserves under UK GAAP, and are now classified as liabilities under IFRS, disclosed within other borrowed funds and accounted for at amortised cost.
The interest payable on such securities is recognised in the income statement through interest payable on an effective interest rate basis.
Subordinated liabilities Under UK GAAP, dated and undated subordinated loan capital was included at nominal value adjusted for premiums, discounts and expenses, all of which were amortised evenly over the period to redemption or reset.
Under IFRS, such loan capital is accounted for at amortised cost, with interest payable recognised in the income statement through interest payable on an effective interest rate basis.
