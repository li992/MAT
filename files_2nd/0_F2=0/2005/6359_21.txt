56 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 General information Group 4 Securicor plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
As a result of a Scheme of Arrangement of Securicor plc, which became effective on 19 July 2004, Group 4 Securicor plc became the ultimate holding company of the Securicor plc group of companies and, on the same date, and as a result of a recommended offer for its shares, acquired Group 4 A S, the holding company of the former security businesses of Group 4 Falck A S. On the basis that the transaction was effected by using a new parent, Group 4 A S was identified as the acquirer.
The comparative results for the year to 31 December 2004 are therefore those of the full year of trading of the security businesses of the former Group 4 Falck A S and the trading of the businesses of Securicor plc for the period from 20 July 2004 to 31 December 2004.
The comparative balance sheet at 31 December 2004 has been adjusted to reflect the completion during 2005 of the initial accounting in respect of acquisitions made during 2004.
Adjustments made to the provisional calculation of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired amount to 18.4m, with an equivalent increase in the reported value of goodwill.
The impact of these adjustments on the net assets acquired is presented in note 16.
The nature of the groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 5 and in the operating review on pages 14 to 23.
The group operates throughout the world and in a wide range of functional currencies, the most significant being the euro, the US dollar and sterling.
The groups financial statements are presented in sterling, as the groups primary listing is in the UK.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
The address of the registered office is given on page 113.
2 Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the first time in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted for use in the European Union EU and its interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IFRS.
With certain mandatory or optional exceptions detailed in IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the comparatives for 2004 have been restated under IFRS and the groups date of transition to IFRS is 1 January 2004, other than in respect of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, for which it is 1 January 2005.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS were included in the IFRS financial information published on 5 September 2005 and are represented in note 43.
The effect of the groups election to apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005 is that the 2004 comparative income statement, statement of recognised income and expense and balance sheet are, in respect of these standards alone, presented in accordance with UK GAAP applicable in 2004 and do not include any charge or credit in respect of changes in the fair values of financial instruments.
3 Significant accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the going concern basis and using the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments in 2005.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions which are of most significance to the group are those relating to the valuation of the assets of acquired businesses, the assessment of the recoverable amounts in respect of assets tested for impairment and the valuation of retirement benefit obligations.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised.
57 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Significant accounting policies continued b Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities its subsidiaries controlled by the company collectively comprising the group made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities, determined either by the groups ownership percentage, adjusted for any options or convertible instruments, or by the terms of any shareholder agreement.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency in the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the carrying value of the minority interest are allocated against the interest of the parent, except to the extent that the minority has both a binding obligation and the ability to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of control or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control, in that strategic financial and operating decisions require the unanimous consent of the parties.
The groups interest in joint ventures is accounted for using the proportionate consolidation method, whereby the groups share of the results and assets and liabilities of a jointly-controlled entity is combined line by line with similar items in the groups consolidated financial statements.
Associates An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the groups consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale see note 3t.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of the associates in excess of the groups interest in those associates are not recognised.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where a group company transacts with a joint venture or associate of the group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the relevant joint venture or associate.
c Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than sterling are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities, on monetary items that are in substance a part of the groups net investment in foreign operations and on monetary liabilities that are designated as hedging that net investment, all of which are recognised directly in equity.
In order to further hedge its translation exposure to certain foreign currencies in which more than 1% of the groups consolidated net operating assets are denominated, the group utilises derivative financial instruments see note 3d for details of the groups accounting policies in respect of such instruments.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the groups overseas operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on their acquisition, are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising are recognised in equity and subsequently recycled to the income statement in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
In accordance with the optional exemption under IFRS 1, cumulative translation differences on overseas operations are deemed to be zero as at the date of transition.
58 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Significant accounting policies continued c Foreign currencies continued The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities that report in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are restated in terms of the measuring unit the hyperinflationary currency current at the balance sheet date before they are translated into sterling.
d Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting In accordance with its treasury policy, the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes but to reduce the groups exposure to financial risk.
Such financial risk includes the interest risk on the groups variable-rate borrowings and foreign exchange risk on transactions, on the translation of the groups results and on the translation of the groups net assets measured in foreign currencies, to the extent that these are not matched by foreign currency borrowings.
The group manages these risks through a range of derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, fixed rate agreements, forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet as financial assets or liabilities at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged as described below.
As explained in note 2, the comparatives for 2004 have not been restated in respect of financial instruments which are stated at cost, less impairment.
Fair value hedge The change in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the related portion of the hedged item is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow hedge The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and subsequently recycled to the income statement when the hedged cash flow impacts the income statement.
The ineffective portion of the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Net investment hedge The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and subsequently recycled to the income statement when the hedged net investment impacts the income statement.
e Intangible assets Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by the application of the purchase method.
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly-controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is stated at cost, less any accumulated impairment losses, and is tested annually for impairment.
In respect of associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included within the net investment in associates.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Acquisition-related intangible assets Intangible assets on acquisitions that are either separable or arising from contractual rights are recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Such acquisition-related intangible assets include trademarks, technology, customer contracts and customer relationships.
The fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets is determined by reference to market prices of similar assets, where such information is available, or by the use of appropriate valuation techniques, including the royalty relief method and the excess earnings method.
Acquisition-related intangible assets are amortised by equal annual instalments over their expected economic life, up to a maximum of ten years.
The directors review acquisition-related intangible assets on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
59 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Significant accounting policies continued e Intangible assets continued Other intangible assets development expenditure Development expenditure represents expenditure incurred in establishing new services and products of the group.
Such expenditure is usually of a revenue nature.
However, if such expenditure creates an identifiable asset, its cost can be measured reliably, it is probable that it will generate future economic benefits, it is technically and commercially feasible and the group has sufficient resources to complete development, it is recognised as an intangible asset.
Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over the period during which the expenditure is expected to be revenue-producing, up to a maximum of ten years.
The directors review the capitalised development expenditure on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Other intangible assets software Computer software is capitalised as an intangible asset if such expenditure both internally generated and externally purchased creates an identifiable asset, if its cost can be measured reliably and if it is probable that it will generate future economic benefits.
Capitalised computer software is stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Amortisation is charged on software so as to write off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives up to a maximum of five years.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold land.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of the assets to their estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings up to 2% Short leasehold buildings under 50 years over the life of the lease Equipment and motor vehicles 10% 33.3% Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful economic lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Where significant, the residual values and the useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment are re-assessed annually.
The directors review the carrying value of property, plant and equipment on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, provide for any impairment in value.
g Financial Instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their fair value.
PFI assets Under the terms of a Private Finance Initiative PFI or similar project, where the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset remain largely with the purchaser of the associated services, the groups interest in the asset is classified as a financial asset and included at its discounted value within trade receivables.
Current asset investments Current asset investments comprise investments in securities, which are classified as held-for-trading.
They are initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs, and subsequently measured at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recognised at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at fair value.
60 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Significant accounting policies continued g Financial Instruments continued Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
h Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost represents expenditure incurred in the ordinary course of business in bringing inventories to their present condition and location and includes appropriate overheads.
Cost is calculated using either the weighted average or the first-in-first-out method.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.
j Impairment The carrying value of the groups assets, apart from inventories and deferred tax assets, is reviewed on an ongoing basis for any indication of impairment, and if any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its net selling price and its value in use, where value in use is assessed as the estimated future cash flows deriving from the asset discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate which reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset attaches.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is tested annually through assessing the carrying values of the cash generating units to which the goodwill attaches.
An impairment loss recognised in respect of a cash-generating unit is allocated first so as to reduce the carrying value of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit, and then to reduce the carrying value of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of any other asset, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine its recoverable amount.
The amount of the reversal is limited such that the assets carrying amount does not exceed that which would have been determined after depreciation and amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised.
k Repurchase of share capital When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
Where repurchased shares are held by an employee benefit trust, they are classified as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from equity.
l Employee benefits Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefits scheme.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The discount rate used is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the groups obligations.
The expected investment income on assets and the finance cost on liabilities are recognised in the income statement as components of investment income and finance cost respectively.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and presented outside the income statement in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested.
Otherwise it is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits vest.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to unrecognised past service cost plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
61 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Significant accounting policies continued l Employee benefits continued Long-term service benefits The groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits other than retirement benefits represents the present value of the future benefit that employees have earned as at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of associated assets.
Share-based payments The group has applied the optional transitional exemptions in IFRS 2 Share-based Payment and implemented its requirements for grants of equity instruments made after 7 November 2002 which had not vested by 1 January 2005.
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value of share-based payments is determined at the date of grant and expensed, with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
The amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.
The fair value of share-based payments granted in the form of options is measured by the use of the Black-Scholes valuation technique, adjusted for future dividend receipts and for any market-related performance conditions.
m Provisions Provisions are recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Items within provisions include claims against the groups captive insurance businesses, costs of meeting lease requirements on unoccupied properties and restructuring provisions for the costs of a business reorganisation where the plans are sufficiently detailed and where the appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.
Where the time value of money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of the expected expenditure using an appropriate discount rate.
n Revenue recognition Revenue Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Revenue for the manned security and cash services products and for recurring services in the security systems products is recognised over the period in which the service is provided.
Revenue on security systems installations is recognised either on completion in respect of product sales, or in accordance with the percentage of completion method in respect of construction contracts.
Construction contracts Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is likely that they will be agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that are deemed likely to be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses as they are incurred.
Where it is likely that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Construction contracts are recognised on the balance sheet at cost plus profit recognised to date, less provision for foreseeable losses and less progress billings.
Government grants Government grants in respect of items expensed in the income statement are recognised as deductions from the associated expenditure.
Government grants in respect of property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the lives of the related assets.
62 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Significant accounting policies continued n Revenue recognition continued Interest Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
This is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividends Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
o Borrowing costs All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement.
p Profit from operations Profit from operations is stated after the share of results of associates but before investment income and finance costs.
Exceptional items of particular significance, including restructuring costs, are included within profit from operations but are separately disclosed.
q Income taxes Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill in a business combination or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
r Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the inception of the lease at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the groups net investment in the leases.
Lease payments made or received are apportioned between finance charges or income and the reduction of the lease liability or asset so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the outstanding balance of the liability or asset.
Rentals payable or receivable under operating leases are charged or credited to income on a straight-line basis over the lease terms, as are incentives to enter into operating leases.
63 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Significant accounting policies continued s Segment reporting A segment is a significant component of the group which is subject to risks and rewards distinguishable from those of other segments either by the nature of the services provided business segment or by the economic environment in which it transacts business geographical segment.
t Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
The group must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
A discontinued operation is a component of the groups business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale, that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or that meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
u Dividends Dividends are recognised as distributions to equity holders in the period in which they are declared.
Dividends proposed but not declared are not recognised but are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
v Accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet mandatory and not adopted IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures was issued in August 2005 and will apply to the group from 1 January 2007.
This standard supersedes IAS 32 and requires further quantitative and qualitative disclosures in respect of financial instruments.
IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease was issued in December 2004 and will apply to the group from 1 January 2006.
This interpretation requires that arrangements that have the nature, if not the legal form, of a lease are accounted for in accordance with IAS 17 Leases.
Its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the group.
4 Revenue An analysis of the groups revenue is as follows: 2005 2004 Notes m m Continuing operations Sale of goods 143.8 116.9 Rendering of services 3,945.9 2,936.3 Revenue from construction contracts 40.2 40.4 Revenue from continuing operations as presented in the consolidated income statement 5 4,129.9 3,093.6 Discontinued operations Rendering of services 39.8 89.5 Revenue from discontinued operations 6 39.8 89.5 Other operating income Interest receivable 12.0 4.6 Expected return on pension plan assets 60.8 35.0 Total other operating income 72.8 39.6 64 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 5 Business and geographical segments The group operates in three core product areas: manned security, security systems and cash services.
The group operates on a worldwide basis and derives a substantial proportion of its revenue and operating profit from each of the following geographic regions: the United Kingdom, the rest of Europe, North America, and New Markets comprising Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East and Gulf States, and Asia Pacific.
The current management structure of the group is a combination of product area and geography, within which the larger businesses generally report by product area.
The groups primary segmentation is therefore by business segment and its secondary segmentation is by geography.

During the disposal process the group did not have control over these operations and in consequence their results have not been consolidated from 20 July 2004.
Group 4 Falck Cash Services UK was sold on 7 March 2005 and the manned security business of Falck Security Nederland on 2 November 2005.

73 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 16 Acquisitions Current year acquisitions The group undertook a number of acquisitions in the year, none of which were individually material.
Principal acquisitions in subsidiary undertakings include the purchase of 100% interests in OneService, a valuables transportation business in the US, and in Universal ATM Services, a cash-in-transit business in Canada.
In addition, a further 21% of the shares of Hashmira, the Israeli security company, were acquired.
The following table sets out the book values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and their provisional fair value to the group in respect of all acquisitions made in the period: Fair value Book value adjustments Fair value Notes m m m Acquisition-related intangible assets i 11.9 11.9 Other intangible assets ii 0.2 0.1 0.1 Property, plant and equipment ii 5.3 1.4 3.9 Inventories 0.1 0.1 Trade and other receivables iii 16.5 0.3 16.2 Cash and cash equivalents 3.0 3.0 Trade and other payables iv 16.4 0.5 16.9 Provisions iv 0.9 1.4 2.3 Borrowings 1.3 1.3 Deferred tax liabilities v 4.0 4.0 Net assets acquired of subsidiary undertakings 6.5 4.2 10.7 Acquisition of minority interests vi 7.1 1.5 8.6 Goodwill 32.6 Total purchase consideration 51.9 Satisfied by: Cash 49.1 Transaction costs 1.6 Contingent consideration 1.2 Total purchase consideration 51.9 Details of fair value adjustments are as follows: i to recognise customer-related intangible assets identified on acquisition.
ii to reflect their fair value in use.
iii to reflect their fair value.
iv to measure certain liabilities at fair value.
v to recognise deferred tax on the acquisition-related intangible assets identified on acquisition.
vi to recognise 2.1m acquisition-related intangible assets identified on acquisition, net of 0.6m of associated deferred tax liabilities.
The fair values of net assets acquired are provisional and represent estimates following a preliminary valuation exercise.
These estimates may be adjusted to reflect any development in the issues to which they relate.
Final fair value adjustments will, if required, be reflected in the comparative to the 2006 consolidated financial statements.
The goodwill arising on acquisitions can be ascribed to the existence of a skilled, active workforce and the opportunities to obtain new contracts and develop the business.
Neither of these meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets.
In aggregate, the acquired businesses contributed 71.8m to revenues, 8.5m to profit before interest, taxation, amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles and exceptional items and 3.5m to net profit for the part year they were under Group 4 Securicor plc ownership.
If all acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2005, group revenue would have been 4,141.9m, profit before interest, taxation, amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles and exceptional items would have been 254.9m and profit for the year would have been 91.0m.
74 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 16 Acquisitions continued Prior year acquisitions Securicor plc On 19 July 2004, Group 4 Securicor plc acquired the Securicor plc group of companies in a share for share exchange.
The provisional assessment of fair value adjustments which was made for the financial period ended 31 December 2004 has been finalised in the 12 months following the date of acquisition and the comparatives adjusted accordingly.

The book value of net assets acquired stated in accordance with IFRS would have been 0.7m rather than 89.6m due to the recognition of pension fund balances net of related deferred taxation.
75 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 16 Acquisitions continued Prior year acquisitions Securicor plc continued Details of the provisional fair value adjustments to the assets and liabilities of Securicor plc made in 2004, including the transitional adjustments to state the assets and liabilities in accordance with IFRS, are as follows: a to recognise technology and trademark-based assets and customer-related intangible assets identified on acquisition.
b to reclassify software previously classified within property, plant and equipment.
c to reflect the market value of properties, the fair value in use of other assets as at the date of acquisition, the reclassification of software previously classified within property, plant and equipment and the proportionate consolidation of joint ventures.
d to reflect the proportionate consolidation of joint ventures.
e to reflect their fair value and the proportionate consolidation of joint ventures.
f to reflect their fair value.
g to reflect the estimated recoverable amount of investments held exclusively for resale.
h to reflect the proportionate consolidation of joint ventures.
i to reflect the recognition of corporation tax and other liabilities in existence at the date of acquisition and the proportionate consolidation of joint ventures.
j to reflect the proportionate consolidation of joint ventures.
k to reflect the recognition of pension fund balances, the recognition of deferred tax in respect of acquisition-related intangible assets, the proportionate consolidation of joint ventures and the recognition of liabilities in existence at the date of acquisition.
l to reflect the minority share of the other fair value adjustments.
Details of the final fair value adjustments to the assets and liabilities of Securicor made in the 12 months following the date of acquisition and adjusted in the comparatives are as follows: m to reflect the fair value in use of assets acquired as at the date of acquisition.
n to reflect the fair value in use of assets acquired excluding properties.
o to reflect the deferred tax impact of the other final fair values adjustments.
p to reflect their fair values.
q to reflect the recognition of liabilities in existence at the date of acquisition.
The fair value of a contingent liability of Securicor plc at the date of acquisition cannot be measured reliably and is therefore not recognised separately as part of the allocation of the cost of the business combination.
Full disclosure of the contingent liability acquired is provided in note 38.
The goodwill arising upon the acquisition of Securicor plc can be ascribed to the cost synergy opportunities available through the integration of the business, the existence of a skilled, active workforce in the acquired businesses and the opportunities to obtain new contracts and develop the businesses.
None of these meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets.
76 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 16 Acquisitions continued Prior year acquisitions other acquisitions The group undertook a number of other acquisitions in 2004, none of which are individually material.
A summary of the book values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and their fair value to the group is provided below: Book value and fair value of assets acquired m Acquisition-related intangible assets 10.2 Intangible assets other than acquisition-related 0.5 Property plant and equipment 8.8 Inventories 0.8 Trade and other receivables 4.6 Borrowings 0.5 Other current and non-current liabilities 14.6 Net assets acquired 9.8 Minority interests 2.6 Goodwill 33.4 Total purchase consideration 40.6 Satisfied by: Cash consideration 24.6 Deferred consideration payments 16.0 Total purchase consideration 40.6 It is considered that the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is represented by the book value apart from the recognition of acquisition-related intangible assets identified on acquisition.
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration over the net assets acquired.
In aggregate, the businesses acquired in 2004 contributed 587.0m to revenues, 43.9m to profit before interest, taxation, recognition of acquisitionrelated intangibles and exceptional items and 7.5 m net loss for the part year they were under Group 4 Securicor plc ownership.
If all acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2004, group revenue would have been 3,780.6m, profit before interest, taxation, amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles and exceptional items would have been 218.2m and the loss for the year would have been 41.6 m. 17 Disposal of a subsidiary As referred to in note 6, the group disposed of the manned security business of Falck Security Nederland and its subsidiaries with the exception of aviation security activities on 2 November 2005, and of Group 4 Falck Cash Services UK and Securicor Luxembourg on 7 March 2005 as required by the European Commission.
In addition, the security operations of Cognisa Security in the US were sold on 31 August 2005.
The net assets of operations disposed during 2005 at the date of disposal and at 31 December 2004 were: At date 31 December of disposal 2004 Property, plant and equipment 0.3 0.3 Trade and other receivables 7.6 8.6 Investments 32.3 30.5 Net assets of operations disposed 40.2 39.4 Provisions 7.2 Loss on disposal 5.3 Total consideration 42.1 Satisfied by: Cash 42.1 The impact of the disposals on the groups results and cash flows in the current and prior periods is disclosed in note 6.
During 2004, additions arising on the acquisition of Securicor plc amounted to 0.6m.
Other additions amounted to 0.6m 2004: nil and the amortisation charge associated to these assets was 0.1m 2004: nil.
Customer-related intangibles comprise the contractual relationship with customers and the customer relationships which meet the criteria for identification as intangible assets in accordance with IFRS.
The carrying amount at 31 December 2005 of the customer contracts and relationships recognised upon the acquisition of Securicor plc was 200.0m, and the amortisation period remaining in respect of these assets is 8.5 years.
78 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 18 Intangible assets continued Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating units CGUs which are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The following CGUs have significant carrying amounts of goodwill: 2005 2004 m m US Manned Security 285.5 255.3 United Kingdom Cash Services 226.1 219.1 UK Justice 92.6 92.6 Netherlands Manned Security 87.1 90.3 United Kingdom Manned Security 60.9 60.9 Other all allocated 420.5 378.1 Total goodwill 1,172.7 1,096.3 The group tests tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment on an annual basis.
The impairment test is performed just prior to the year end when the budgeting process is finalised.
The groups impairment test compares the carrying value of each CGU to its recoverable amount.
Under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, an impairment is deemed to have occurred where the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying value.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined by its value in use which is derived from discounted cash flow calculations.
These calculations include forecast cash flows for a period of five years.
The five year cash flow forecasts are based on the budget for the following year year one, the business plans for years two and three, and projections for years four and five.
Cash flows at the end of the five year forecast period are projected into perpetuity at the lower of the planned growth rate in year three and the forecast underlying economic growth rate for the economies in which the CGU operates.
Where the planned growth rate in year three exceeds the forecast underlying economic growth rate, the excess is progressively reduced in the projections for years four and five.
Future cash flows are discounted at a pre-tax, weighted average cost of capital which for the group is 10.4% 2004: 10.7%.
This rate is adjusted where appropriate to reflect the different financial risks in each country or region in which the CGUs operate.
In applying the groups model, no goodwill impairment has been identified in any of the groups CGUs for the year ended 31 December 2005.
An impairment of 55.9m was identified and recognised for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculations relate to the discount rate and underlying economic growth rate.
With all other variables being equal, if the group discount rate were to be increased by 1% to 11.4%, with an equivalent increase in the discount rate for all countries or regions, an impairment of approximately 5m would arise.
With all other variables being equal, if the underlying growth rate in all countries were to be reduced by 1%, an impairment of approximately 4m would arise.
These approximations indicate the sensitivity of the impairment test to changes in the underlying assumptions.
However, it is highly unlikely that any variations in the assumptions would impact on all CGUs at the same time.

This relates to the groups proportion of assets held in respect of the Private Finance Initiative PFI projects undertaken by the groups joint ventures, which on completion in 2005 were transferred to amounts receivable under PFI contracts.
Further details are provided in note 24.

20 Investment in joint ventures The group has the following significant interests in joint ventures: a The group owns 100% of the equity of Wackenhut Services, Inc. WSI under US Foreign Ownership Controlling Interest provisions, governed through a proxy agreement.
WSI provides security services to US Government agencies including security services on sites deemed to be strategically sensitive.
Whilst the group is represented on the WSI board through shareholder proxies, day to day management of business remains with an independent board reporting directly to the US government.
The group, through the proxy agreement, has the power to veto certain operational and strategic decisions.
Control of the operation is therefore shared between the parties and WSI is accounted for as a joint venture.
This means that the group proportionately consolidates the results of WSI at 100%, giving rise to an accounting result identical to that which would be the case if WSI were accounted for as a subsidiary.
b At the year end the group owned 50% of the equity of Bridgend Custodial Services Limited, 50% of the equity in STC Milton Keynes Limited and a 49% equity shareholding in Safeguards Securicor Sdn Bhd, in Malaysia.
In all cases, the group jointly shares operational and financial control over the operations and is therefore entitled to a proportionate share of the results of each, which are consolidated on the basis of the equity shares held.
The results of each of the jointly controlled operations are prepared in accordance with group accounting policies.
Amounts proportionately consolidated into the groups financial statements are as follows: Results 2005 2004 m m Income 328.7 246.3 Expenses 312.7 234.2 Profit after tax 16.0 12.1 81 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 20 Investment in joint ventures continued Balance sheet 2005 2004 m m Assets Non-current assets 49.6 56.2 Current assets 88.6 79.0 138.2 135.2 Liabilities Current liabilities 57.4 47.0 Non-current liabilities 44.9 45.3 102.3 92.3 Net assets 35.9 42.9 21 Investment in associates The groups share of associates profit and net assets and the reconciliation to the net investment are as follows: 2005 2004 m m Total assets 11.5 26.3 Total liabilities 7.6 16.2 Net investment in associates 3.9 10.1 Revenue 88.1 65.2 Profit for the period 5.3 2.4 The results presented above primarily relate to the associated undertaking in Space Gateway Support LLC, in the USA, in which the group holds an investment of 46%.

There is no concentration risk with respect to trade receivables, as the groups customers are both large in number and geographically dispersed.
Included within trade and other receivables is 40.8m 2004: 64.0m pledged as security against borrowings of the group.
Amounts receivable under PFI contracts comprise the groups proportion of amounts receivable in respect of the Private Finance Initiative PFI projects undertaken by the groups joint ventures.
There were no changes in these arrangements during the year.
The projects are the design, construction, financing and management of HM Prison and Young Offenders Institution Parc in Bridgend, South Wales, for the Home Office: and the Oakhill Secure Training Centre for young people in Milton Keynes for the Youth Justices Board.
The Bridgend contract commenced in January 1996 and expires in December 2022.
The Milton Keynes contract commenced in June 2003 and expires in June 2028.
Both contracts can be terminated by the customer either in the event of a severe failure to comply with the contract or voluntarily with six months notice and the payment of appropriate compensation.
The specified assets remain the property of the customers.
The groups joint ventures have the right to provide services using the specified assets during the life of the contracts.
There is currently no obligation to acquire or build further assets and any such obligation would be agreed with the customers as variations to the contracts.
The pricing basis is inflation-indexed.
25 Construction contracts Contracts in place at the balance sheet date are as follows: 2005 2004 m m Amounts due from contract customers included in trade and other receivables 13.9 10.0 Amounts due to contract customers included in trade and other payables 1.9 1.3 Net balances relating to construction contracts 12.0 8.7 Contract costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses to date 26.4 20.3 Less: Progress billings 14.4 11.6 Net balances relating to construction contracts 12.0 8.7 At 31 December 2005, advances received from customers for contract work amounted to 4.0m 2004: 3.2m.
There were no retentions held by customers for contract work at either balance sheet date.
All trade and other receivables arising from construction contracts are due for settlement within one year.
The directors believe the fair value of amounts due from and to contract customers, being the present value of future cash flows, approximates to their book value.

The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Cash and cash equivalents of 15.9m 2004: 9.8m are held by the groups wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries.
Their use is restricted to the settlement of claims against the groups captive insurance subsidiaries.
27 Non-current assets classified as held for sale Non-current assets classified as held for sale at 31 December 2004 included the operations of Falck Security Nederland and Group 4 Falck Cash Services UK Limited, which were owned by the group prior to the acquisition of Securicor plc.
They are shown within current assets as held for sale, at their carrying value as at 19 July 2004 see note 6, less an impairment charge in respect of the net realisable value of Falck Security Nederland.
In addition, the investment in Securicor Luxembourg SA, which was acquired as part of the acquisition of Securicor plc, was also held exclusively for resale as an investment at fair value at the date of acquisition, 19 July 2004.

The groups bank borrowings comprise a 1bn multicurrency revolving credit facility with a maturity date of June 2010, other committed facilities of 58.2m and uncommitted facilities of 289.0m.
At 31 December 2005, undrawn committed available facilities amounted to 268.8m 2004: 366.5m.
Interest on all borrowing facilities is at prevailing LIBOR or Euribor rates, dependent upon the period of drawdown, plus an agreed margin and repriced within one year or less.
The committed bank facilities are subject to financial covenants and any non-compliance with covenants may lead to an acceleration of maturity.
The group was fully in compliance with its financial covenants throughout the year to 31 December 2005 and the year to 31 December 2004.
Borrowing at floating rates exposes the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The management of this risk is discussed in note 31.

The weighted average lease term is eight years 2004: 7.6 years.
For the year ended 31 December 2005, the weighted average effective borrowing rate was 5.4% 2004: 5.7%.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
The directors believe the fair value of the groups finance lease obligations, being the present value of future cash flows, approximates to their book value.
The groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.

Currency risk and forward foreign exchange contracts The group conducts business in many currencies.
Transaction risk is limited since wherever possible each business operates in local currency, including financing activities.
However, the group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding borrowings in foreign currencies.
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency net borrowings are recognised in equity to match translation adjustments on foreign currency equity investments.
At 31 December 2005, the groups US dollar including dollar-related and euro including euro-related net assets before net borrowings respectively were approximately 93.2% and 97.0% hedged by net borrowings.
The group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts so as to hedge translation risk not hedged by way of borrowings.
Gains and losses on such forward foreign exchange contracts are recognised in equity.
The notional value of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2005 was 312.0m.
All these contracts had matured by 31 January 2006.
All the foreign exchange hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as net investment hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps Borrowing at floating rates as described in note 28 exposes the group to cash flow interest rate risk, which the group manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
Interest rate swaps and, where appropriate, forward rate agreements are utilised to fix the interest rate on a proportion of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum period of five years.
At 31 December 2005 the nominal value of such contracts was 166.0m in respect of US dollar and 130.5m in respect of euro, their weighted average interest rate was 4.8% US dollar 2.9% euro and their weighted average period to maturity was 3.5 years.
All the interest rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash flow hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
86 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 Derivative financial instruments continued Counterparty credit risk The groups strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis.
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty.
The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the transaction.
For short-term transactions under one year, the financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either the Standard & Poors or Moodys rating agencies.
For long-term transactions, the financial counterparty must have a minimum rating of A A1 rating from Standard & Poors or Moodys.
At an operating level the minimum investment grade rating criteria applies.
Exceptionally, where required by local country circumstances, counterparties with no or non investment grade rating can be approved as counterparties for a period of up to twelve months.
Due to the groups global geographical footprint and exposure to multiple industries, there is minimal concentration risk.
32 Retirement benefit obligations 2005 2004 m m Net liability on funded defined retirement benefit schemes 216.6 220.2 Unfunded defined retirement benefit obligations 24.4 15.4 241.0 235.6 Less: Amounts included within current liabilities 30.0 30.8 Included within non-current liabilities 211.0 204.8 The group operates a wide range of retirement benefit arrangements which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
The majority of schemes are of a defined contribution structure, including the contracted-in defined contribution schemes which are the main schemes for new UK employees.
In the Netherlands, most employees are members of an industry-wide defined benefit scheme, but as it is not possible to separately identify the groups share of the assets and liabilities of the scheme it is accounted for as a defined contribution scheme.
Contributions made to defined contribution schemes and charged to the income statement totalled 46.3m 2004: 32.6m.
The group operates a number of unfunded defined benefit retirement arrangements.
Liabilities under these arrangements are stated at the discounted value of benefits accrued to date, based upon actuarial advice.
Benefits accruing during the year charged to the income statement in respect of these arrangements totalled 1.5m 2004: 1.2m.
The groups primary funded defined retirement schemes are in the UK, but it also operates such schemes in the Netherlands, Ireland and Canada.
The assets of defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The pension costs are assessed on the advice of qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
In the UK, the membership of the pension scheme demerged from the former Group 4 Falck A S is about 5,000.
The membership of the Securicor scheme, responsibility for which the group assumed on 20 July 2004 with the acquisition of Securicor plc, is about 21,000.
Regular actuarial assessments of the schemes are carried out, the latest being at 31 March 2005 in respect of the Group 4 scheme and at 5 April 2003 in respect of the Securicor scheme.
The Securicor scheme was certified by an independent actuary as meeting the Minimum Funding Requirement solvency level, in that the market value of assets exceeded the assessment of the schemes liabilities on a current funding level basis.

Pension obligations stated in the balance sheet take account of future service and earnings increases, have been updated to 31 December 2005 and use the valuation methodologies specified in IAS 19 Employee Benefits.

The Group 4 pension scheme also included the employees of Global Solutions Limited, which was one of the businesses demerged from the security businesses of the former Group 4 Falck A S on 19 July 2004.
The pension disclosures are presented as if that demerger had always been effective.
An adjustment of 6.9m has been made to the 1 January 2004 position as reported in the Listing Particulars on 4 June 2004 in respect of the effect of the demerger.
The analysis of the scheme assets and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date is as follows: Analysis of scheme assets UK Netherlands Ireland Canada Total % % % % % 2005 Equity instruments 70 40 78 57 70 Debt instruments 28 50 12 35 28 Property 106 Other assets 2 4 8 2 100 100 100 100 100 2004 Equity instruments 70 21 67 51 68 Debt instruments 25 67 13 43 27 Other assets 5 12 2065 100 100 100 100 100 90 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32 Retirement benefit obligations continued The expected weighted average rates of return on scheme assets for the following year at the balance sheet date is as follows: UK Netherlands Ireland Canada Total % %%%% 2005 6.5 5.0 5.9 6.2 6.4 2004 7.0 4.8 6.4 6.0 6.9 2003 7.4 6.2 6.7 7.0 7.4 The expected rates of return on individual categories of plan assets are determined by reference to relevant indices of the historical return relative to inflation in respect of assets of a similar nature.
The overall expected rate of return is the weighted average of the rates on the individual asset categories.
The history of experience adjustments is as follows: 2005 UK Netherlands Ireland Canada Total Experience adjustments on scheme liabilities Amount m 17.5 2.0 2.1 1.2 16.4 Percentage of scheme liabilities % 1 12 8 7 1 Experience adjustments on scheme assets Amounts m 99.0 0.2 2.0 0.2 101.4 Percentage of scheme assets % 10 3 11 210 2004 Experience adjustments on scheme liabilities Amount m 2.7 2.7 Percentage of scheme liabilities % 1 1 Experience adjustments on scheme assets Amounts m 30.2 2.9 0.6 0.2 33.9 Percentage of scheme assets % 484 24 The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the scheme during the current financial year commencing 1 January 2006 in respect of the current service cost is 14.0m.
Additional contributions of 23.5m will also be made in respect of the deficit in the schemes.
IAS 19 specifies that pension liabilities should be discounted at appropriate high quality corporate bond rates.
The directors consider that it is appropriate to apply the AA corporate bond rate which most closely approximates to the timescale of the liability profile of the schemes and have therefore used such a rate, being 5.3%, in respect of the UK schemes at 31 December 2005 5.9% at 31 December 2004.
The effect of a 0.1% movement in the discount rate applicable in the UK is to alter reported liabilities before associated deferred tax by approximately 24.0m.
Liability calculations are also heavily impacted by the mortality projections included in the actuarial assumptions.
The average life expectancy at 65 of a male member of the UK schemes currently aged 50 has been assumed as 21 years, which the directors consider, on actuarial advice, to be appropriate to the profile of the membership of the schemes.
The effect of a one year change in this UK life expectancy assumption is to alter reported liabilities by approximately 26.0m.

Restructuring Restructuring provisions include amounts for redundancy payments, and the costs of closure of activities in acquired businesses and discontinued operations.
Settlement of restructuring provisions is highly probable.
The timing is uncertain but is generally likely to be short term.
Claims reserves The claims reserves are held by the wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries in Guernsey, Luxembourg and the US which underwrite part of the groups cash services, general liability, workers compensation and auto liability policies.
The provisions are subject to regular actuarial review and are adjusted as appropriate.
Settlement of these provisions is highly probable but both the value of the final settlements and their timing is uncertain, dependent upon the outcome of ongoing processes to determine both liability and quantum in respect of a wide range of claims or possible claims.
Onerous contracts The onerous contract provision mainly comprises the provision against future liabilities for all properties sub-let at a shortfall and for long-term idle, leased properties.
The provision is based on the value of future net cash outflows relating to rent, rates, service charges and costs of marketing the properties.
Whilst the likelihood of settlement of these obligations is considered probable, there is uncertainty over their value and duration.
Other provisions The company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
Provision is made for the estimated value of settlements likely to be made, but both this value and the timing of any payments are uncertain.
The directors do not anticipate, taking account of legal and other professional advice as appropriate, that the outcome of these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on the groups financial position or on the results of its operations.
92 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 34 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting periods: Retirement Other benefit Intangible temporary obligations assets Tax losses differences Total m m m m m At 1 January 2004 21.7 7.1 12.8 16.0 Credit to the income statement 0.9 4.0 7.9 21.7 34.5 Acquisition of subsidiaries 41.0 80.0 9.4 29.6 Disposal of a subsidiaries 2.8 2.8 Charge to equity 3.8 3.8 Translation adjustments 1.5 1.6 0.1 At 31 December 2004 66.1 76.0 15.0 16.7 21.8 At 1 January 2005 66.1 76.0 15.0 16.7 21.8 Credit charge to the income statement 1.2 10.0 6.8 8.7 4.3 Acquisition of subsidiaries 4.6 4.6 Charge to equity 6.8 6.8 Reallocation of current tax 7.6 7.6 Translation adjustments 0.3 1.1 0.8 At 31 December 2005 74.1 70.9 8.2 16.7 28.1 Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where permitted.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2005 2004 m m Deferred tax liabilities 84.8 89.2 Deferred tax assets 112.9 111.0 Total deferred tax position 28.1 21.8 At the balance sheet date, the group has unutilised tax losses of approximately 145.0m 2004: 146.0m potentially available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset of 8.2m 2004: 15.0m has been recognised in respect of approximately 22.0m 2004: 49.0m of gross losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 123.0m 2004: 97.0m of gross losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams in the relevant jurisdictions and the fact that a significant proportion of such losses remains unaudited by the relevant tax authorities.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are gross losses at 3.5m and 1.0m which will expire in 2008 and 2010 respectively.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 1,043.0m 2004: 933.0m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these gross differences on the basis that the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.
At the balance sheet date, the group has total unprovided contingent tax liabilities of approximately 57.0m relating to unresolved tax issues in various jurisdictions.
No provision has been made for these amounts on the basis that the group considers that the likelihood of the liabilities crystallising is improbable.
It is not possible to estimate the timing or resolution of these issues.

Argenbright was responsible for passenger checkpoint security screening for two of the flights involved in the terrorist atrocities of 11 September 2001, being the United Airlines flight from Newark to San Francisco and the American Airlines flight from Washington to Los Angeles.
The hijacked planes performing these flights crashed respectively in rural Pennsylvania and into the Pentagon, Washington.
The directors believe that, in respect of those two flights, Argenbright carried out its security screening services properly and in accordance with its contractual and regulatory duties and that it should have no liability for the losses that occurred subsequently.
However, the events of 11 September were so extraordinary that it is impossible at this stage to state with certainty that no findings against Argenbright will be made.
Argenbright is being sued and a number of lawsuits have been served upon it.
Securicor plc now known as Securicor Limited has also been named in some of the lawsuits.
At 11 September 2001, Argenbright, which is a stand-alone limited liability corporation, had in place aviation liability insurance which included cover for acts of terrorism and which, the directors believe, provided insurance cover of US$1billion for each of the two flights referred to above.
Additionally, contingent liabilities exist in respect of agreements entered into in the normal course of business, none of which are individually or collectively significant.
Details of unprovided contingent tax liabilities are presented in note 34.
96 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 39 Operating lease arrangements The group as lessee At the balance sheet date, the group had outstanding commitments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2005 2004 m m Within one year 60.6 57.0 In the second to fifth years inclusive 97.5 90.9 After five years 126.5 128.7 Total operating lease commitments 284.6 276.6 The group leases a number of its office properties, vehicles and other operating equipment under operating leases.
Leased properties are negotiated over an average term of ten years, at rates reflective of market rentals.
Periodic rent reviews take place to bring lease rentals in line with prevailing market conditions.
Some but not all lease agreements have an option to renew the lease at the end of the lease term.
Leased vehicles and other operating equipment are negotiated over an average lease term of 3.5 years.
Certain leased properties have been sub-let by the group.
Sub-leases are negotiated on terms consistent with those of the associated property.
The total future minimum sub-lease payments expected to be received by the group from sub-let properties amount to 15.2m 2004: 16.1m.
40 Share-based payments The group has two types of equity-settled share-based payment scheme in place: 1 share options previously held by employees over Securicor plc shares and rolled over with the acquisition of that business on 19 July 2004, and 2 conditional allocations of shares made to employees following the acquisition.
Share options Share options rolled over from Securicor plc fall under either the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS or the Sharesave Scheme.
Options under the ESOS were granted at market value, vest three or four years following the date of grant provided that certain non-market performance conditions are met and that the recipients continue to be employed by the group during the vesting period and are exercisable up to ten years following the date of grant.
Options under the Inland Revenue-approved Sharesave scheme were granted at a discount of 20% to market value, vest after three years following the date of grant and remain exercisable for a period of six months following vesting.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2005 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of five months.
97 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 40 Share-based payments continued Share options continued The rollover of share options from Securicor plc on 19 July 2004 has been accounted for as a modification to the original option.
The weighted average fair value of the modified options that were originally granted after 7 November 2002 was 50.61p.
The inputs into the Black-Scholes options valuation model at the date of rollover in respect of the modified options are as follows: Weighted average share price at date of grant 80.95p Weighted average share price at date of rollover 122.00p Weighted average exercise price 67.31p Expected volatility at date of grant 45% Expected volatility at date of rollover 30% Weighted average expected contractual life at date of grant 4 years, 5 months Weighted average expected contractual life at date of rollover 2 years, 2 months Risk free rate 4.5% Expected annual dividend growth 5% Expected volatility was determined at the date of grant by reference to the volatility of Securicors share price during the previous year and at the date of rollover by reference to the volatility of the prices of shares comparable to those of the company at that date.
Total expenses of 1.5m were recognised in the income statement in the period 2004: 0.7m in respect of share options, the calculation of which included an estimate of the number which would vest based upon the probable achievement against the performance conditions and the historic experience of forfeitures within Securicor.
Shares conditionally allocated Shares conditionally allocated under the groups Performance Share Plan vest after three years, to the extent that a certain non-market performance conditions are met as to 50% of the allocation and b certain market performance conditions are met as to the remaining 50% of the allocation.
The number of shares conditionally allocated is as follows: 2005 2004 Number Number Outstanding at beginning of period 3,521,866 Allocated during the period 4,686,950 3,521,866 Forfeited during the period 445,397 Outstanding at the end of the period 7,763,419 3,521,866 The weighted average remaining contractual life of conditional share allocations outstanding at 31 December 2005 was 23 months.
The weighted average share price at the date of allocation of shares conditionally allocated during the period was 132.75p 2004: 123.00p and the contractual life of all conditional allocations was three years.
The vesting of 50% of the shares conditionally allocated depends upon Total Shareholder Return a market performance condition over the vesting period measured against a comparator group.
25% of the allocation vests upon the groups Total Shareholder Return equalling median performance amongst the comparator group.
The fair value of the shares allocated subject to this market performance condition has therefore been reduced by 75%.
Total expenses of 1.2m were recognised in the income statement in the period 2004: 0.8m in respect of conditional share allocations, the calculation of which included an estimate of the number of those shares allocated subject to non-market performance conditions that would vest based upon the probable achievement against the performance conditions.

100 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 43 Explanation of transition to International Financial Reporting Standards As stated in note 2, the financial year ended 31 December 2005 is the first year that the groups consolidated financial statements have been presented in accordance with IFRS.
The accounting policies as set out in note 3 have been applied in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005, in the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 and in the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004, being the groups date of transition to IFRS.
The previous consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 were prepared in accordance with the then UK GAAP.
On transition, in preparing its opening balance sheet and comparative financial statements, the group has adjusted amounts previously reported.
Reconciliations of 2004 comparative numbers between those previously presented under the then UK GAAP and those now presented under IFRS, together with an explanation of the changes, were published with the groups interim statement in September 2005 and are available on the groups website.
However, the group has represented reconciliations in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards below: i Reconciliation of equity from the then UK GAAP to IFRS At 1 January 2004 the date of transition and 31 December 2004 At At 1 January 31 December Notes 2004 2004 Equity under UK GAAP 323.6 918.0 Adjustments to conform to IFRS: Goodwill amortisation b 49.8 Goodwill impairment b 7.2 Amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles c 9.4 Employee benefits d 72.2 130.7 Tax effect of above adjustments d 21.7 65.9 Dividends i 3.6 23.5 Total adjustment to equity 46.9 8.1 Equity under IFRS 276.7 909.9 ii Reconciliation of profit or loss reported under the then UK GAAP to IFRS Operating profit before amortisation and exceptional Loss before Loss for items taxation the year Notes m m m Profit loss under the then UK GAAP for the year ended 31 December 2004 166.4 46.1 94.9 Adjustments to conform to IFRS: Goodwill amortisation b 48.8 49.8 Goodwill impairment b 4.7 7.2 Amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles c 13.4 9.4 Employee benefits d 1.6 2.9 3.0 Share-based payment e 0.7 0.7 0.7 Reclassification of leases k 0.6 Total adjustment to profit loss 1.7 27.1 29.5 Profit loss under IFRS for the year ended 31 December 2004 164.7 19.0 65.4 iii Cash flow statement Following the transition to IFRS, the net adjustment to cash flows of the group for the year ended 31 December 2004 was 7.5m due to the proportionate consolidation of joint ventures.
101 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 43 Explanation of transition to International Financial Reporting Standards continued iv First time adoption IFRS 1 establishes the transitional requirements for the first time preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
In general, a company is required to determine its IFRS accounting policies effective at the reporting date and apply these retrospectively to the balance sheet at the date of transition, and to all financial statements for the comparative period and the reporting period.
To assist in the transition process, there are a number of exemptions to this retrospective application.
The following significant exemptions have been adopted by the group: Business combinations:The group has elected not to account for business combinations retrospectively in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Those combinations recognised prior to the date of transition have not been restated.
Employee benefits:The group has elected to adopt the proposed amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits which provide the group with the option of recognising all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in equity at the date of transition, with subsequent actuarial gains and losses being taken directly to equity via the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
This is consistent with the treatment under UK GAAP, required by FRS 17 Retirement benefits.
Cumulative translation differences: In accordance with IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, on translation of a foreign operation certain exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity, which must be disclosed, and on subsequent disposal accumulated differences form part of the calculation of profit or loss on disposal.
The group has elected not to calculate these translation differences retrospectively.
Cumulative translation differences recognised separately in equity under IFRS are taken to be nil at the date of transition.
Share-based payment: In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, the group is recognising a charge to income representing the fair value of outstanding employee share options over the relevant option vesting periods, adjusted to reflect the actual and expected levels of vesting.
However, the group has elected not to apply IFRS 2 retrospectively to equity instruments either granted on or before 7 November 2002 and or vesting prior to 1 January 2005.
Financial instruments:The group has elected to apply the requirements of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement prospectively from 1 January 2005 and consequently the restated figures for 2004 do not reflect the impact of these standards.
v Explanation of adjustments to conform to IFRS The analysis below sets out the most significant adjustments to the financial results for Group 4 Securicor plc for the year ended 31 December 2004 arising from the transition to IFRS.
a Presentation of financial statements The format of the groups primary financial statements has been presented in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
The resultant changes have a significant impact on the presentation of the groups share of results of associated undertakings and discontinued operations in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Under UK GAAP, the groups share of associated undertakings was disclosed separately in the profit and loss account, by operating profit, interest and taxation.
Under IFRS, the results of associated undertakings are presented in the income statement as a single line item net of tax, as a component of profit before tax.
Discontinued operations have been presented in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations as a single line item, being the total of the post tax profit or loss of discontinued operations and the post tax gain or loss on disposal of those businesses constituting discontinued operations.
IFRS does not follow UK GAAP requirements of specific presentation of exceptional items on the face of the Income Statement, but does require additional items to be disclosed when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of an entitys financial performance.
The group therefore continues to separately identify items similar to those previously treated as exceptional under UK GAAP, with the exception of profit loss on disposal on sale or termination of operations, which is included in the result for discontinued operations, as described above.
b Non-amortisation of goodwill Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisition was capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, goodwill is not amortised, but is tested for impairment at least annually, in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
In the restatement to IFRS, the amortisation charge has been reversed from the date of transition and added back to profit for the year.
The revised goodwill figure has been tested for impairment at 31 December 2004 and, as a result, the impairment of goodwill under UK GAAP increases by the 2004 amortisation charge associated with those businesses.
In addition, the provision for loss on disposal of discontinued operations increases.
102 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 43 Explanation of transition to International Financial Reporting Standards continued v Explanation of adjustments to conform to IFRS continued c Business combinations IFRS 3 introduces significant changes to accounting for business combinations compared to UK GAAP, the most significant being the recognition of separable or contractual intangible assets on an acquisition.
The group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations prior to 1 January 2004.
The application of IFRS 3 and IAS 38 Intangible Assets has resulted in the recognition of separable or contractual intangibles comprising trademarks, technology and customer-related intangibles, on the acquisition of Securicor and other acquisitions during 2004.
A deferred tax liability is provided in respect of these intangible assets in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes.
These intangibles are amortised over their useful economic lives, applicable to the individual characteristics of the respective asset.
Amortisation has been charged to the consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition, together with a related deferred tax credit.
d Employee benefits Under UK GAAP, the group accounted for post-retirement benefits in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs and provided detailed disclosures under FRS 17 Retirement benefits.
Under SSAP 24, the regular cost of providing benefits is charged to operating profit on a systematic basis over the service lives of member employees with any variation from the regular cost being allocated over the expected remaining service lives of members.
Pension fund liabilities are valued on a best estimate basis.
The approach under IFRS falls under the scope of IAS 19 Employee Benefits, as amended by the International Accounting Standards Board, which is consistent with the approach under FRS 17.
The standard requires recognition on the balance sheet of employee benefit largely pension liabilities.
As a result, the full surplus or deficit for each retirement benefit scheme, representing the difference between the market value of the schemes assets and the present value of the accrued liabilities, is recognised as an asset or liability on the balance sheet.
The group has elected to adopt the amendment to IAS 19, which permits actuarial gains and losses to be charged or credited immediately to equity through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The current cost of benefits accrued in the period is calculated according to the IAS 19 methodology and the charge to the income statement is therefore higher than under SSAP 24. e Share-based payment Under UK GAAP, the group recognised a charge to the profit and loss account for share-based compensation based on the intrinsic value of the share benefits at the date of the award expensed over the period of performance.
The groups principal schemes comprise savingsrelated and discretionary share option schemes.
Under UK GAAP, there is no charge for these share-based compensation schemes because they either have an intrinsic value of nil, resulting from the option price being set at the market value at the date of grant, or because they are an Inland Revenue approved scheme, and therefore excluded from the requirement to record a charge.
The requirements for accounting for employee share options under IFRS are set out in IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
This requires an entity to recognise a charge to income in respect of share options based on the fair value of the awarded options at the date of grant.
This expense is recognised over the relevant vesting periods, adjusted to reflect the actual and expected levels of vesting.
The group has adopted the Black-Scholes valuation technique for the purpose of computing fair values under IFRS 2.
IFRS 2 has not been applied to options either granted on or before 7 November 2002 and or vesting prior to 1 January 2005, in accordance with the exemption permitted in IFRS 1. f Joint ventures Under UK GAAP, joint ventures are accounted for in accordance with FRS 9 Associates and joint ventures, whereby the results of joint venture operations are recognised under the gross equity method.
Under this method of accounting, the groups share of joint venture turnover is recognised as part of total turnover, and operating profit, interest and taxation from joint ventures is shown separately from the rest of the groups results.
The accounting treatment for joint ventures under IFRS is governed by IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures.
In accordance with IAS 31, the group has elected to account for joint ventures using proportionate consolidation, whereby the group recognises its share of their results, assets and liabilities on a line-by-line basis, included within the groups results.
There is no separate recognition.
Following a review of the classification of investments, the group has concluded that its interests in Safeguards Securicor Sdn Bhd, in Malaysia, previously classified as an associate undertaking and in Wackenhut Services, Inc. previously classified as a subsidiary, should both be accounted for as joint ventures under IFRS.
The groups share of their results is therefore proportionately consolidated in line with the groups other joint venture operations, as described above.
103 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 43 Explanation of transition to International Financial Reporting Standards continued v Explanation of adjustments to conform to IFRS continued g Financial instruments For the year ended 31 December 2004, in the UK, there was no accounting standard which comprehensively addressed accounting for financial instruments, although the disclosure was dealt with in FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures.
IFRS provides detailed guidance on financial instrument recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure within IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS requires that all derivative financial instruments must be recognised in the balance sheet as financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value.
The change in the fair value of a derivative instrument is taken immediately to the income statement, resulting in profit and loss volatility, unless it can be demonstrated on inception that it fulfils a specified hedge function and can be demonstrated to be effective in this function.
If fair value hedge accounting is applied, the fair value of the derivative will be offset by a change in the fair value of the hedged item, which will also be recognised in the income statement.
When cash flow hedging is applied, the change in the fair value of the derivative is taken to equity, subsequently being recycled to the income statement when the hedged cash flow impacts the income statement.
The change in the fair value of any ineffective portion of a derivative is taken to the income statement.
In accordance with the exemption in IFRS 1, the group has applied IAS 32 and IAS 39 prospectively from 1 January 2005. h Deferred taxation Under UK GAAP, deferred tax is accounted for under FRS 19 Deferred Taxation and was provided in full on timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in tax computations.
Provision was made for deferred tax that would arise upon the remittances received from overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that the dividends had been accrued as received.
In accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes, deferred tax must be recognised on all taxable temporary timing differences between the accounting base and tax base of assets and liabilities.
As a result, under IFRS deferred tax is recognised on certain temporary differences that would not generate deferred tax under UK GAAP.
i Dividends Under UK GAAP, the final proposed dividend was provided for in the year-end results.
Under IFRS, however, this is not permitted because it does not represent a present obligation as defined by IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Dividends are provided for in the year they are declared.
The amount provided for in the 2004 financial statements is therefore reversed.
Similarly an adjustment is made in the transition balance sheet.
j Capitalisation of software Under UK GAAP, capitalised computer software is included within tangible fixed assets on the balance sheet.
Under IFRS, all separately identifiable capitalised computer software should be shown as an intangible asset, except where it is integral to a related item of hardware.
In this instance it remains classified within property, plant and equipment.
Any charge to profit in respect of separately identified computer software is classified as amortisation of intangible assets under IFRS as opposed to depreciation under UK GAAP.
Accordingly, software has been reclassified in the balance sheets as at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets.
This reclassification has no impact on the income statement.
k Leases The criteria applied to the classification of leases as between operating leases and finance leases are broadly the same under IFRS as under UK GAAP.
However, the application to the groups leasing contracts of the series of qualitative tests laid out in IAS 17 Leases has required a reclassification of certain contracts as finance leases rather than operating leases.
In consequence, both the value of the asset and the associated financing obligation have been recognised on the balance sheet and costs classified as lease rentals under UK GAAP have been reclassified to depreciation and financing costs under IFRS.
l Securities Under UK GAAP, securities held as investments by the groups captive insurance companies were not included within net debt.
There is no definition of net debt within IFRS.
However, in the opinion of the directors, net debt includes such securities.
