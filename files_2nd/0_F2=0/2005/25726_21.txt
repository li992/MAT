Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 30th September 2005 A SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN APPLIED CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR IS SET OUT BELOW.
Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of investments.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with UK law, applicable accounting standards and with the revised Statement of Recommended Practice SORP, Financial statements of investment trust companies, as issued by the AITC in January 2003. ii.
Valuation of investments Listed investments are valued at last-trade prices.
Where trading in the securities of an investee company is suspended, the investment is valued at the Boards estimate of its net realisable value.
Unlisted investments are valued by the Board.
In making their valuations, the Board have taken into account, where appropriate, latest dealing prices, valuations from reliable sources, asset values and other relevant factors.
Realised surpluses or deficits on the disposal of investments and permanent impairments in the value of investments are taken to capital reserve realised, and unrealised surpluses and deficits on the revaluation of investments are taken to the capital reserve unrealised.
Year-end exchange rates are used to translate the value of investments which are denominated in foreign currencies.
Income Dividends from equity shares are included in the revenue account on an ex-dividend basis.
Overseas dividends are shown gross of withholding tax.
Interest receivable on fixed interest stocks, deposit interest and stock lending income is recognised in the revenue account on an accruals basis.
Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged to the revenue account except as follows: expenses which are incidental to the acquisition of an investment are included within the cost of the investment: and expenses which are incidental to the disposal of an investment are deducted from the disposal proceeds of the investment.
expenses are charged to capital reserve realised where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
The management fee has been allocated 80% to capital reserve realised and 20% to the revenue account, in line with the Boards expected long term split of returns in the form of capital gains and income, respectively, from the investment portfolio.
expenses which are incidental to capital events of the Company are charged to capital reserve realised.
v. Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of Financial Reporting Standard 4 Capital Instruments.
Financing costs of debt insofar as they relate to the financing of the Companys investments or to financing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Companys investments are allocated 80% to capital reserve realised and 20% to the revenue account, in line with the Boards expected long term split of returns in the form of capital gains and income, respectively, from the investment portfolio.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transactions.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the capital reserve, or in the revenue account depending on whether the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature respectively.
Taxation Deferred tax using the liability method is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred that result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less, tax in the future.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.

JPMorgan Fleming Japanese 37 Notes to the Accounts continued 16.
Financial instruments The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares primarily in Japan.
These are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies.
As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long-term.
Bank loans denominated in Japanese Yen, for which the main purpose is to raise finance for the Companys operations: Short-term debtors, creditors and cash amounts arising directly from its operations: Derivative transactions principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts the purpose of which is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Companys investment activities.
The main risk attached to the Companys financial instruments is market price risk which incorporates foreign currency risk.
Acceptance of these risks is a clear part of the Companys business as an investment trust and the Boards policy for managing these risks are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which these financial statements relate.
On 27th October, the TOPIX future was closed, resulting in a total loss of 1,309,000 to the Company.
Market Price Risk Market risk arises from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Boards principal control is to ensure that equity and other investments held within the portfolio are appropriately diversified across companies and industry sectors and it meets regularly to consider and monitor the position.
An individual fund manager has responsibility for monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Foreign Currency Risk The Company has an exposure to foreign currency as part of the risk reward inherent in a company that invests overseas.
The income and capital value of the Companys investments can be affected by exchange rate movements as most of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys reporting currency.
The Board has identified four principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: movements in rates affect the value of investments: movements in rates affect the value of loans: movements in rates affect short-term timing differences: and movements in rates affect the income received.
The Company may be subject to short-term exposure to exchange rate movement, for instance where there is a difference between the date an investment purchase or sale is entered into and the date when settlement of the proceeds occurs.
Financial instruments continued Credit Risk The transactions in securities that the Company enters into expose it to the risk that the counterparty will not deliver the shares on a purchase or cash on a sale after the Company has fulfilled its responsibilities.
There is also a counterparty risk associated with deposit takers.
The Company only buys and sells investments through brokers which have been approved by JPMAM as an acceptable counterparty.
In addition, limits are set as to the maximum exposure to any individual broker that may exist at any time.
Deposits are only placed with counterparties that have been approved by JPMAM as an acceptable counterparty.
Interest Rate Risk The Company currently borrows at floating rates of interest and can use interest rate swaps to generate both the desired interest rate profile and to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Liquidity Risk The Companys assets comprise mainly realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
Currency Exposures An analysis of the Companys net foreign currency assets and liabilities at 30th September is: 2005 2004 1 1 m m Investments 574.0 419.7 Net current liabilities 71.0 27.1 Financial instruments outstanding at year end 503.0 392.6 1 These are Yen exposures, expressed in sterling.
Interest Rate Risk Profile of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The majority of the Companys financial assets are equity shares or other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date.
Liabilities The analysis of the Companys financial liabilities at 30th September is: 2005 2004 1 1 m m Floating rate liabilities 69.8 60.2 1 These are Yen exposures, expressed in sterling.
The floating rate liabilities bear interest at rates based on Japanese Yen Libor and comprise: Yen 10bn loan facility entered into on 25 08 2005 with Lloyds TSB, only 8bn Yen drawn down at the year end.
Yen 6bn revolving facility borrowed from a syndicate of lenders, expiring 29 12 2005.
Yen 6bn revolving facility with ING Bank repaid on 25 08 2005.
Further details regarding maturity can be found in note 9 on page 35.
