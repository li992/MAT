Where it does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and its financing.
Operations are financed mainly through retained profits and in certain geographical locations, bank borrowings.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these policies are summarised below.
Policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the financial year.
Foreign currency risk The Group has transactional currency exposures.
These arise on sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than the companies operating or functional currency.
Significant sales are hedged at the date of invoicing by means of matched borrowings and forward currency contracts.
Significant purchases are hedged by means of forward currency contracts.
The Group which is based in the UK and reports in Sterling, has a significant investment in overseas operations in the USA and Europe, with further investments in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, China and India.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
Where significant and appropriate, currency denominated net assets are hedged by currency borrowings.
These currency exposures are reviewed regularly.
The Group does not hedge future currency profits, so the Sterling value of overseas profits earned during the year is sensitive to the strength of Sterling, particularly against the US Dollar and the Euro.
Finance and interest rate risk The Group does not have significant exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Where bank borrowings are used to finance operations they tend to be short-term with floating interest rates.
Borrowings used to manage foreign currency risk are drawn on the Groups loan facilities and have fixed interest rates with maturities of not more than one year.
68 Halma p. l. c. 2005 HALMA Notes on the Accounts continued 000 24 Financial instruments continued Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts.
Liquidity risk The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally based on geographic location.
Funds are placed on deposit with secure, highly-rated banks.
For short-term working capital purposes, most operating companies utilise local bank overdrafts.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
Because of the nature of their use, the facilities are typically on demand and as such uncommitted.
Borrowing facilities, including the Groups revolving loan facilities, are typically renewed annually.
Currency exposures The table below shows the Groups net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities.
These are the assets and liabilities of Group companies which are not denominated in the functional currency of the company involved.
They comprise cash and overdrafts, and certain debtors and creditors.
These foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Profit and Loss Account as a result of movement in exchange rates.
As at year end these exposures were as follows: 2005 Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities Functional currency of operation Sterling US Dollar Euro Other Total Sterling 1,137 387 568 182 US Dollar 829 288 1,117 Euro 60 536 505 981 Other 24 699 78 200 953 Total 745 2,372 21 137 3,233 2004 Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities Functional currency of operation Sterling US Dollar Euro Other Total Sterling 747 1,850 115 2,482 US Dollar 5 3 2 Euro 79 1,509 77 1,507 Other 79 1,249 13 2 1,339 Total 5 3,505 1,860 40 5,330 The amounts shown in the tables above take into account the effect of any forward currency contracts entered into to manage these currency exposures.
Interest rate risk profile The Groups financial assets which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise cash deposits which totalled 35,581,000 at 2 April 2005 2004: 33,898,000.
These comprised Sterling denominated deposits of 24,073,000 2004: 32,531,000, US Dollar denominated deposits of 3,663,000 2004: nil, Euro and other currency deposits of 7,845,000 2004: 1,367,000 which are placed on local money markets and earn interest at market rates.
Halma p. l. c. 2005 69 HALMA Notes on the Accounts continued 000 24 Financial instruments continued The financial liabilities which are subject to interest rate fluctuations are bank loans, bank overdrafts and certain unsecured loans, which totalled 33,344,000 at 2 April 2005 2004: 26,934,000.
All are subject to floating rates of interest.
These comprise US Dollar denominated bank loans of 19,577,000 2004: 20,218,000 which bear interest with reference to the US Dollar LIBOR rates, US Dollar denominated bank overdrafts of 13,000 2004: 76,000 which bear interest at rates referenced to US Dollar base rates, Euro denominated bank loans of 13,527,000 2004: 6,458,000 which bear interest with reference to the Euro LIBOR rates, Euro denominated bank overdrafts of 111,000 2004: 142,000 which bear interest at rates referenced to Euro base rates and Sterling denominated bank overdrafts of 116,000 2004: 40,000 which bear interest at rates referenced to UK base rates.
Maturity of financial liabilities With the exception of the deferred purchase consideration and other creditors due after one year, all of the Groups financial liabilities mature in one year or less or on demand.
The total of deferred purchase consideration due after one year includes 3,948,000 2004: 44,000 due between one and two years, with the balance of 80,000 2004: 115,000 due between two and five years.
Other creditors due after more than one year include 507,000 2004: 105,000 due between one and two years, 786,000 2004: 379,000 due between two and five years, with the balance of 214,000 2004: 611,000 due after more than five years.
Borrowing facilities The Groups principal source of borrowing facilities is through on demand bank overdrafts which are, by definition, uncommitted.
These facilities are generally reviewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year or less.
The Group also has committed borrowing facilities which are used for the purpose of managing foreign currency risk.
At 2 April 2005 committed facilities of this type amounted to 53,757,000 of which 33,104,000 was drawn down.
The borrowing facilities are reviewed annually, and as such the weighted average maturity of the facilities is less than one year.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities As at 2 April 2005 there was no significant difference between the book value and fair value as determined by market value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
Hedging As explained above, the Groups policy is to hedge significant sales and purchases denominated in foreign currency using forward currency contracts.
The gains and losses on these instruments are recognised upon recognition of the underlying exposure.
The amounts of unrecognised gains or losses on instruments used for hedging at 2 April 2005 and 3 April 2004 are not significant.
With the exception of currency exposures, the disclosures in this note exclude short-term debtors and creditors.
25 Commitments Capital commitments Capital expenditure authorised and contracted at 2 April 2005 but not provided in these accounts amounts to 2,070,000 2004: 523,000.

26 Pensions Group companies operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The Halma Group Pension Plan and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan have sections of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
During 2002 03, both of these defined benefit sections were closed to new entrants and a defined contribution section was established within the Halma Group Pension Plan.
Defined contribution schemes are mainly adopted in overseas subsidiaries.
Pension contributions for the Group are paid in accordance with the advice of professionally qualified actuaries.
The Halma Group Pension Plan was last assessed as at 1 December 2002, and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan as at 1 April 2004, using the projected unit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the valuations were firstly that the investment return would exceed the rate of salary growth by 3.25% Apollo: 2.50% per annum dependent on the scheme membership category, and secondly that pensions in the course of payment would increase at 2.5% Apollo: 2.75% per annum or, for future service, in accordance with the requirements of the Pension Act 1995.
At 1 December 2002 the market value of the Halma Group Pension Plans assets was 42,533,000.
The actuarial value of the schemes assets represented 69% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The shortfall is being addressed by increased company contributions.
At 1 April 2004 the market value of the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plans assets was 8,278,000.
The actuarial value of the schemes assets represented 59% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
