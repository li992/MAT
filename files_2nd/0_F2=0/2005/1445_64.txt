Financial Statements 107 23 POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS Pensions Background The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group.
Many of these plans are defined contribution, where the company contribution and resulting income statement charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
However, several plans, mainly in the UK, the US and Sweden, are defined benefit, where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary typically averaged over 1, 3 or 5 years.
The major plans are funded through legally separate trusteeadministered funds.
The major defined benefit plans, apart from the collectively bargained Swedish plan, have been closed to new entrants since 2000.
The cash funding of the plans, which may from time to time involve special payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets together with future contributions should be sufficient to meet future obligations.
The funding is monitored rigorously by the Company and appropriate fiduciaries specifically with reference to the Companys credit rating, market capitalisation and cash flows.
Post-retirement scheme deficit The assets and obligations of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group at 31 December 2005 as calculated in accordance with IAS 19 are shown below.
The fair values of the schemes assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present value of the schemes obligations is derived from cash flow projections over long periods and is thus inherently uncertain.
UK With regard to the Groups main UK defined benefit fund, the most recent full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2003 and the pension cost assessed using the projected unit credit method.
Since then the Company has paid both single and regular contributions to fund the deficit, and the impact of these has been monitored through interim valuations in 2004 and 2005.
In the interim valuation performed by the funds actuaries, at 31 March 2005, the key assumptions, set out in a manner consistent with the 2003 valuation, were revised having regard to the investment conditions at 31 March 2005.
The long term UK price inflation was set at 2.75% pa, salary increases at 4.03% pa, pension increases at 2.75% pa and investment returns at 6.2% pa.
The market value of the funds assets at the valuation date was 2,625m $4,933m equivalent, representing 92.3% of the funds actuarially assessed obligations.
Rest of Group The US defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2005 when plan obligations were $1,512m and plan assets were $1,329m.
The US makes contributions to mitigate for plan benefit deficits on a regular basis.
The Swedish defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2005, when plan obligations were estimated to amount to $713m and plan assets were $545m.
The German defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2005, when plan obligations amounted to $209m and plan assets were $27m.
The Japanese defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2005, when plan obligations amounted to $285m and plan assets were $186m.
The majority of the Japanese plan obligations will be converted to defined contribution assets during 2006 following employee agreement to revise the Japanese benefits programmes.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions In the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, AstraZenecas employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees.
As at 31 December 2005, some 3,694 retired employees and covered dependants currently benefit from these provisions and some 14,183 current employees will be eligible on their retirement.
AstraZeneca accrues for the present value of such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee.
The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2005 was $12m 2004 $11m, 2003 $9m.
Plan assets were $230m and plan obligations were $257m at 31 December 2005.
These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits under IAS 19.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and 108 Form 20-F Information 2005 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23 POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED Financial assumptions Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 December 2005.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long term nature of the scheme, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
These assumptions were as follows: 2005 2004 Rest of Rest of UK Group UK Group Inflation assumption 2.7% 2.1% 2.7% 2.4% Rate of increase in salaries 3.9% 3.5% 3.9% 3.9% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.7% 0.7% 2.7% 0.7% Discount rate 4.9% 4.6% 5.3% 5.1% Long term rate of return expected at 31 December Equities 8.3% 7.9% 8.3% 8.6% Bonds 5.1% 5.6% 5.1% 5.3% Others 5.6% 4.4% 5.6% 4.7% Rate of increase in medical costs 9.0% 10.0% 8.0% 9.0% The Group uses certain mortality rate assumptions when calculating scheme obligations.
The current mortality assumptions for all major schemes retain prudent allowance for future improvements in longevity and take account of experience.
The mortality tables used for the major schemes are as follows: UK: PMA92 with special AZ-specific adjustment to reflect actual experience as investigated at each valuation, and allowance for future improvement US Qualified Plans : RP2000 Sweden: P94 Japan: National Census No.
18 Life Table Germany: Huebeck tables 2005G The expected return on assets is determined with reference to the expected long term level of dividends, interest and other returns derived from the plan assets, together with realised and unrealised gains or losses on the plan assets, less any costs of administering the plan, less any tax payable by the plan.
The expected returns are based on long term market expectations and analysed on a regular basis to ensure any sustained movements in underlying markets are reflected.
