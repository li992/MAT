2 During 2004, the Group adopted UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts and related amendments to UITF Abstract 17 revised 2003 Employee Share Schemes, which constituted a change in accounting policy for the way the Group presents and accounts for own shares.
Prior year figures were restated to reflect the new policy.
3 The amounts disclosed for 2003 and earlier years are stated on the basis of UK GAAP because it is not practicable to restate amounts for periods prior to the date of transition to IFRS.
The principal differences between UK GAAP and IFRS are explained in Note 32 to the financial statements which provides an explanation of the transition to IFRS.
The amounts disclosed for 2003 and earlier years have been translated into US dollars using the applicable year exchange rates.
