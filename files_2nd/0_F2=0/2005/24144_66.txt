The goodwill has been allocated to the following segments: 2005 2004 m m UK Life & Pensions 193 259 Lombard 151 - FPI - - Asset Management 333 327 Total goodwill 677 586 In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is assessed for possible impairment each year.
This assessment takes place in December of each year and compares the carrying value of goodwill for each segment with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been taken to be the segments calculated value in use.

Intangible assets continued There has been no goodwill impairment charge in 2005 2004: nil.
The value in use for UK Life & Pensions and Lombard has been taken from their business plans.
These projections reflect the long-term nature of the business and forecast the cash flows over the anticipated terms of the policies.
The plans include forecast sales of new business for three years and other assumptions that take into account both past experience and market conditions.
The key assumptions to which the calculated values in use are most sensitive are set out below: Investment market conditions: the plans assume modest investment growth.
Policy lapses: the plans assume no change from recent experience.
Sales and margins: the plans assume a modest reduction in margins but an increasing level of sales.
Expenses: the plans assume that expenses will broadly increase in line with inflation.
Discount rate: the discount rate applied to UK Life & Pensions is 6.9% and to Lombard is 7.5%.
The outcome of the impairment assessment has been that it is considered unlikely that goodwill in respect of UK Life & Pensions would be impaired given that the value in use is significantly higher than the carrying value of goodwill.
The UK Life & Pensions segment is operated as a single group and so a single value in use has been prepared.
For Lombard, acquired in January 2005, the levels of new business have indicated that there is no requirement for any impairment of goodwill.
No goodwill has been allocated to FPI.
For the Asset Management segment, the value in use is calculated using a cash flow projection based on the latest annual financial budget approved by the Board of F&C Asset Management plc.
The Asset Management segment is operated as a single group and so a single value in use has been prepared.
Sales and margins: the plans assume modest sales and margin growth although operating margins have been capped as a measure of prudence.
Expenses: the plans assume cost growth in excess of inflation recognising the impact of staff costs.
Discount rate: the discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 8.9% based on F&C's weighted average cost of capital The outcome of the impairment review is that there is no requirement for any impairment of goodwill in the Asset Management segment.
In addition, the fair value of the Group's holding in F&C, at 31 December 2005, based on the quoted bid price of F&C's listed ordinary shares was 441m.
This was in excess of the carrying value of the Group's holding in the Asset Management business at this date.
b Acquired PVIF Acquired PVIF is amortised over the lifetime of the in-force policies and is analysed as follows: 2005 2004 Cumulative Cumulative Cost amortisation Net Cost amortisation Net m m m m m m UK Life & Pensions 187 91 96 190 84 106 International Life & Pensions 297 24 273 74 3 71 Total acquired PVIF 484 115 369 264 87 177 Management have assessed acquired PVIF for possible impairment and they have concluded that there is no indication that it has been impaired.
c Investment management contracts Investment management contracts relate to the Asset Management segment and are amortised over their expected useful economic lives of between 10 and 20 years.
During 2005, due to indifferent investment performance in some areas of the Asset Management business as well as other clients of F&C withdrawing funds for strategic reasons following changes in their own corporate structure, the Asset Management business experienced a level of fund outflows which was higher than anticipated and led to net new business targets not being met.

Intangible assets continued This level of lost business will have a notable impact on revenues and was significant enough to be considered an indicator of potential impairment of certain intangible assets, namely the related investment management contracts.
In accordance with IAS 36, a full impairment review of these assets was undertaken.
The review resulted in the impairments being recognised included within Administrative and other expenses in the income statement in respect of investment management contracts as follows: 2005 2004 m m F&C Investment Trust contracts 56 - F&C Institutional contracts 56 - Total impairment recognised in the income statement 112 - The above contracts relate to the investment trust management contracts and institutional fund management contracts acquired as a result of the creation of F&C Asset Management plc following the business combination of ISIS Asset Management plc and F&C Group Holdings Limited on 11 October 2004, after restating the accounts to comply with IFRS.
The recoverable amounts of the assets have been determined based on value in use calculations using cash flow projections based on the latest annual financial budget approved by the F&C board.
The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 9.4% for investment trust contracts, 9.4% for institutional contracts with no fixed term, and 8.4% for fixed term institutional contracts.
These rates reflect the varying risks and uncertainties inherent in the revenues from the underlying assets, using F&Cs weighted average cost of capital of 8.9%, calculated as at 31 December 2005, as a benchmark.
Revenues in the projections have been grown at 6% per annum in line with F&Cs long-term view of market growth, which is consistent with that experienced over the longer term across the markets in which the managed assets are invested.
The revenue projections also incorporate an estimated loss rate of 5% per annum compounded over the projected period in respect of investment trusts, and 14% per annum for institutional contracts with no fixed term.
Costs for the first year of the projections are driven by the budgeted F&C operating margin for 2006.
Thereafter costs are driven by F&Cs projected operating margins, as determined for the purposes of the goodwill impairment review, with the margin capped at 45% as a measure of prudence, based on historical performance.
Impairment has been determined by comparing the results of the value in use calculations in respect of the remaining contracts at the year end to the carrying value cost less aggregate amortisation of the assets at 31 December 2005, with any deficits arising constituting impairment to be recognised for the year.
There were no indicators of potential impairment of intangible assets with finite lives in respect of the comparative period, and as such, no impairment review was performed for 2004. d Other intangible assets Other intangible assets mainly consist of distribution channel relationships and software development which are amortised over their anticipated useful lives of between 3 and 15 years.
The analysis for each segment is as follows: 2005 2004 Cumulative Cumulative Cost amortisation Net Cost amortisation Net m m m m m m UK Life & Pensions 77 54 23 68 41 27 International Life & Pensions 114 11 103 927 Asset Management 422 541 Total other intangible assets 195 67 128 82 47 35 Included in amortisation is 7m 2004: nil in respect of Life & Pensions acquired intangible assets.
Management have assessed other intangible assets for possible impairment and there is no indication that they have been impaired.
