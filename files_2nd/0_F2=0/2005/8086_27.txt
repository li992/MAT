4 IAS 32 and IAS 39 continued All derivative instruments will continue to be recognised on the Balance Sheet at fair value with future gains and losses being recognised immediately in earnings, except when the cash flow hedging requirements of IAS 39 are met, in which case the effective portion of gains and losses are deferred in equity and are recycled through the Income Statement at the time the hedged item affects the Income Statement.
In accordance with IAS 39 the Group has increased trade and other payables accruals by 5,000,000 to provide for sales ledger credits which are potentially repayable under local country legislation and relevant statutes.
5 Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Valuation of Share Based Payments In order to determine the value of share based payments, management are required to make an estimation of the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price calculated over one, two and three years back from the date of grant.
The list of inputs used in the Binomial and Monte Carlo Simulation models to calculate the fair values are provided in Note 40.
Valuation of Financial Instruments at Fair Value Management has made a number of assumptions with regards to the models used to value financial instruments at their fair value at year end.
Note 27 c details the methods used to value the primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups borrowing requirements and the derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate profile.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets There are a number of assumptions management have considered in performing impairment reviews of goodwill and intangible assets.
Note 18 details the assumptions that have been applied.
Pension Assumptions There are a number of assumptions management have considered by use of actuaries which have an impact on the results of the valuation of the pension scheme liabilities at year end.
The most significant assumptions are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
Note 39 details the assumptions which have been applied.
Vacant Property Provision The Group has assumed that vacant properties will not be sub-let and has provided in full to the end of the relevant leases Note 31.
