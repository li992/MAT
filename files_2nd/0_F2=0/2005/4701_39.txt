No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property or intangible assets or on the sale of properties or intangible assets where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
The total amount unprovided is 39 million 2004 36 million: 2003 21 million.
Such tax would become payable only if the property or intangible asset was sold without it being possible to claim further rollover relief and this is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as earnings are re-invested by the group and no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
It is not considered practicable to calculate the amounts involved.
iv Material tax provisions The material tax provisions are discussed below.
Over the past 10 years the group has undergone significant restructuring involving the acquisition and disposal of material businesses and the transfer of businesses intra group.
As a consequence of this restructuring, a number of potential tax exposures have arisen, principally in relation to the tax basis of the assets involved in such transactions.
The group has a provision of 318 million for these exposures.
In addition, as the group operates throughout the world it faces a number of potential transfer pricing issues in many jurisdictions relating to goods, services and nancing.
The issues are often complex and can take many years to resolve.
The total provision contained in the financial statements in respect of transfer pricing issues is 192 million.
Of the remaining tax exposures, the group does not expect material additional losses.
The UK is party to various double tax treaties with foreign jurisdictions which enable Diageos revenues and capital gains to escape a double tax charge to both UK and foreign jurisdiction tax.
If any of these double tax treaties should be withdrawn or amended, or should any member of the Diageo group become involved in taxation disputes with any tax authority, such withdrawal, amendment or a negative outcome of such disputes could have a material adverse effect on Diageos financial condition and results of operations.
