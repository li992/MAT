27 POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Group operates a number of dened contribution and dened benefit pension schemes.
The principal scheme which operates in the UK includes a funded dened benefit section whose assets are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is valued by a qualied actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the actuarys advice so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
Since 1 September 2002, the dened benefit section of the scheme has been closed to new entrants.
Membership of the dened contribution section is now offered to eligible employees.
In the Nordic region and Greece, the Group operates secured dened benefit pension schemes with assets held by life insurance companies and, in Norway, an unsecured pension arrangement.
In addition, contributions are made to a state pension scheme.
The effect of these schemes on the Groups results is not significant.
a Regular pension costs SSAP 24 Pension costs are accounted for in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.

The pension charge in the profit and loss account amounted to 21.7 million 2003 04 18.0 million which represented the regular pension cost of 16.1 million 2003 04 18.0 million and 5.6 million 2003 04 nil of amortisation of the pension deficit over the average remaining service lives of current employees on a straight line basis.
Further contributions of 0.8 million 2003 04 0.3 million were made to dened benefit plans in Greece and the Nordic region.
The pension charge in respect of dened contribution schemes was 1.3 million 2003 04 1.0 million.
A further 0.1 million 2003 04 0.1 million provision was made in respect of the unsecured pension arrangement.
A full actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2004 using the projected unit method and has been used to determine the level of funding to the scheme.
The Groups contribution rate for the period ended 30 April 2005, agreed in consultation with the trustees actuaries, was 10.9 per cent.
The contribution rate for future periods is planned to increase to 12.9 per cent by August 2006 in annual increments of 1 per cent.
The principal actuarial assumptions as at 5 April 2004 used for determining costs and contributions were: Rate per annum Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.0% Rate of increase to pensions Guaranteed Minimum Pension 2.75% Pension in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension 2.75% Discount rate for accrued benets 6.5% Ination 2.5% Investment return for future service benets 6.75% At 5 April 2004, the market value of the schemes investments was 422 million and, based on the above assumptions, the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 87 per cent of the benets accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The value of liabilities exceeded assets by 62 million.
