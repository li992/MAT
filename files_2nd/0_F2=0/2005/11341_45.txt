PENSION COMMITMENTS The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes for its employees, the Northgate Information Solutions Pension Scheme the Northgate Scheme and the Rebus Group Pension Scheme the Rebus Scheme.
Benefits are related to salary close to retirement or leaving service if earlier and also to years of pensionable service.
Assets are held in separate, trustee administered funds.
Employer contributions to the schemes are determined on the basis of regular valuations undertaken by independent, qualified actuaries.
The schemes are closed to new employees, who are instead eligible to join either the defined contribution section of the Northgate Scheme or another defined contribution scheme.
The Northgate Scheme The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the Northgate Scheme was conducted as at 31 March 2002 using the projected unit method.
As at that date, the market value of the assets was 90.4 million and, on the valuation assumption, these assets were sufficient to cover 97% of the liabilities.
The key valuation assumptions related to the rates of return on investments and rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
The pension cost in the accounts includes the regular cost plus a variation in cost and, for the purposes of producing Company accounting information, calculations were produced as at 30 April 2002 and the following assumptions were used: % p. a.
Investment return before retirement 6.25 Salary increases 3.00 Pension increases for service from April 1997 2.70 Pension increases in excess of GMPs, for service up to April 1997 2.50 The total pension cost of the defined benefit part of the Northgate Scheme charged to the profit and loss account for the year to 30 April 2005 was 2,320,000 2004: 2,266,000 which includes an addition for the amortisation of the experience deficit of 1,669,000 2004: 1,599,000.
Employer contributions to the defined benefit part of the Northgate Scheme during the year amounted to 2,320,000 2004: 2,266,000.
This represents broadly 14.3% of members Pensionable Salaries.
The contributions paid to the defined contribution section of the scheme amounted to 394,000 2004: 271,000.
The pension cost figures used in these accounts comply with the current pension cost accounting standard SSAP24.
Under transitional arrangements, the Company is required to disclose the following information about the scheme and the figures that would have been shown under the UK standard FRS17 in the current balance sheet.
