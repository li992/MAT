7 Pensions Both the dened benefit final salary section of the principal group pension scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, and the dened contribution scheme, were closed to new members on 31 December 2001.
Both schemes are funded and contributions by both employees and group companies are held in externally invested trustee-administered funds.
Members of these schemes are contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme.
A replacement, contracted-in, dened contribution arrangement was established as a section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund with eect from 1 April 2002.
The total non-government pension cost for the group, including directors, is analysed below: 2004 5 2003 4 m m Funded schemes 8.3 8.8 Unfunded scheme 0.5 0.4 Overseas schemes 0.1 0.1 8.9 9.3 The pension cost relating to the dened benefit section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance with actuarial advice from Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow, using the projected unit credit valuation basis.
As the scheme is now closed to new members the current service cost, under the projected unit credit valuation basis, will increase as a percentage of salary as members of the scheme approach retirement although the overall cost will decrease as the number of members decreases.
The pension cost for the year has been based on the latest actuarial valuation which was carried out as at 31 March 2002.
The assumptions were derived from market yields.
Separate assumptions were made for the discount rate used to value liabilities and the return expected on the assets.
The value of the assets was calculated as an average of the market values over the past three years.
The main valuation assumptions were that the return on investments would be 4.9% per annum above ination, that the discount rate would be 3.4% per annum above ination until retirement and 2.9% per annum above ination thereafter, that the annual increase in pensionable salaries including promotional increases would be 2.0% above ination and that the annual increase in pensions in payment would average 0.1% per annum below ination.
The regular cost is derived as the service cost calculated using the real discount rates set out above less an adjustment reecting the excess of the expected return on the assets over interest on the liabilities.
The average expected remaining service life of current employees is eight years.
PAGE 60 Whitbread PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004 5 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 7 Pensions continued Membership of the dened benefit section of the fund at 3 March 2005 was 3,840 2004 4,598.
The increase in the pension prepayment included in debtors note 20 represents funding paid to Whitbread Group Pension Fund in excess of the pension cost.
The Board announced in April 2003 that the company had signed an agreement with Whitbread Pension Trustees Limited.
Under that agreement, the company has undertaken to fund the pension scheme for a period of up to 15 years and given undertakings to the trustees similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its banking agreements, up to a value of 300m.
As a consequence of this agreement, payments are being made into the fund for each of the three years, starting in 2003 4, at a rate of 15m above the anticipated SSAP 24 charge.
