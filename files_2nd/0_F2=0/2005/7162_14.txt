EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS Following the results of a strategic review in March 2003 the Group has completed the disposal of all non-core activities and is now focused entirely on Specialist Recruitment.
The disposals and associated restructuring gave rise to an exceptional charge in the year ended 30 June 2003.
Following the expiry of certain warranties, the finalisation of completion accounts and negotiations with purchasers, the provisions have been reviewed resulting in an exceptional write-back of 22.0 million in the year.
In addition, an exceptional profit of 2.4 million arose from the disposal of a property in Belgium and the repayment of loan notes previously provided for.
In the prior year the Group completed the disposal of a number of non-core operations generating an aggregate profit on disposal of 38.4 million, provided 43.9 million for a loan made to the acquiror of Hays Chemicals in 2001 and provided 14.5 million for the costs of demerger of DX Services.
Exceptional items in the year resulted in a cash inflow of 4.8 million and a tax charge of nil.

Hays plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 49 Pension schemes operated Within the UK the Group principally operates three schemes: i The Hays Stakeholder Pension Plan was established with Prudential on 1 July 2001.
Money purchase benefits are funded by contributions from employees and, for eligible employees, from the employer.
Employer contributions are in the range of 2% to 10% of pensionable salary depending on the length of pensionable service.
ii The Hays Pension Scheme is an approved defined benefit scheme, closed to new members since 1 July 2001. iii The Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme is a supplementary unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for employees who are subject to HMRCs earnings cap on pensionable salary.
As a consequence of past acquisitions the Group also operates a number of other small pension arrangements in the UK.
Group policy is to consolidate these into the principal Hays schemes as soon as is practicable.
The majority of overseas arrangements are either defined contribution or government-sponsored schemes and these arrangements are not material in the context of the Group results.
Regular pension costs under SSAP 24 i Group contributions to the Hays Stakeholder Pension Plan during the year were 0.2 million 2004 0.5 million.
The accrual in the balance sheet at 30 June 2005 was nil 2004 nil.
ii Pension costs for the Hays Pension Scheme in the year were 7.0 million 2004 8.4 million, comprising a regular cost of 5.4 million plus a net variation of 1.6 million.
The variation is being spread as a level percentage of salaries over the average remaining working life of the membership 15 years.
The Scheme actuary, an employee of Mercer Human Resource Consulting, assessed the Hays Pension Scheme as at 1 July 2004 using the projected unit method and a market based valuation approach to ascertain its cost to the Group.
The principal financial assumptions were that the rate of return would be 4.1% per annum higher than the rate of price inflation, that increases in past and future pensions, where guaranteed, would be in line with price inflation, and that future salary growth would exceed price inflation by between 1.5% per annum and 2.9% per annum, depending on salary levels at the valuation date.
Following the actuarial valuation it was agreed that the Group would pay an average contribution rate of 14.2% of annual salaries, subject to review at future valuations.
At the date of the latest actuarial valuation the market value of the assets of the Hays Pension Scheme was 271.7 million and the actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 102% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in future earnings.
The next actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme is scheduled for 30 June 2007. iii The Group charges the cost of the Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme each period, as advised by the Groups actuary, to the profit and loss account and holds these amounts as a provision in the balance sheet.
The charge to the profit and loss account during the year amounted to 0.2 million 2004 0.9 million.
The provision in the balance sheet as at 30 June 2005 amounts to 5.7 million 2004 5.5 million.
FRS 17 disclosures In November 2000 the Accounting Standards Board ASB issued FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, replacing SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The ASB has since delayed full implementation of FRS 17 and therefore the Group has continued to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24.
The required disclosures under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 are set out below.
FRS 17 assumptions, asset, liability and reserves disclosures The actuarial valuations of the Hays Pension Scheme and Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme were updated to 30 June 2005 by the Scheme actuary.
The values of assets and liabilities in other schemes operated by the Group were also estimated in preparing the disclosures required under FRS 17.
The principal assumptions used are shown below: 2005 2004 2003 2002 Rate of increase in salaries 5.10% 5.45% 5.10% 5.10% Rate of increase of pensions in payment and deferment 2.60% 2.95% 2.60% 2.58% Discount rate 4.95% 5.73% 5.26% 5.80% Inflation assumption 2.60% 2.95% 2.60% 2.58% The expected rates of return on scheme assets are shown below: % expected rate of return 2005 2004 2003 2002 Equities 7.25% 8.00% 7.50% 8.00% Bonds 4.60% 5.37% 4.90% 5.40% Cash and other assets 4.75% 4.50% 3.75% 4.00% Hays plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 50 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 6.

This was principally due to the return on UK equities, with the benchmark FTSE-All-Share Total Return index rising by 18.7% in the period.
During the year the Hays Pension Scheme revised its assumptions relating to life expectancy of its members, reflecting the advice of the scheme actuary.
The effect of this was to add approximately 3 years to the life expectancy of an average member.
This factor was the largest contributor to the 25.8 million impact noted above.

The age profile of the active membership will rise over time and hence the future service cost is also likely to rise.
The Group has considered the impact of the FRS 17 deficit in respect of the Group, its employees and pensioners.
In the context of the prudent funding structure of the Group, the Group is in a strong position to manage this long term liability to the satisfaction and benefit of all stakeholders.
