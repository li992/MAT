34 Retirement benefit schemes continued The overall expected return on plan assets was derived as an average of the long-term expected rates of return on each of the major asset classes invested in weighted by the allocations of assets among the classes.
The sources used to determine the best estimate of long-term returns include country specific bond yields, which may be derived from the market using local bond indices or by analysis of the local bond market, and country specific inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts or governments expectations.
At 31 December 2005, the long-term expected rate of return on equity instruments, debt instruments and other assets was assumed to be 7.5% pa, 4.2% pa and 4.2% pa respectively for the UK and an average of 7.6% pa, 3.6% pa and 5.6% pa for non-UK schemes which have assets.
For the Hilton Group Pension Plan, the post-retirement mortality assumed is based on the standard PA92 mortality table, which takes into account future improvements, adjusted to reflect experience.
The assumption used implies that the life expectancy of a male retiring now at age 65 is 85 and for a female is 88.

As at the end of 2004 on the local valuation basis, the total assets and liabilities were 1,276m and 1,083m respectively.
This surplus is taken into account in calculating the employers future contribution requirement.
Some employees in the US and Puerto Rico participate in multi-employer defined benefit schemes.
At the most recent local valuations of these schemes, the total assets in respect of all employers were 146.8m and 9.6m and the total liabilities were 288.3m and 17.1m.
At each balance sheet date an appropriate liability has been taken into account, taking future expected contributions into account where appropriate.
35 Share-based payments Hilton Group plc has a performance share plan, an approved and an unapproved share option plan, a Sharesave, a Share Incentive Plan and, depending on performance, potentially a voluntary deferral with a match.
The plans and the various performance conditions are discussed in more detail below.
IFRS 2 is effective for the Groups accounting period starting 1 January 2004, and will apply to share options and share awards granted after 7 November 2002 which are unvested at the start of the period.
All of the plans listed below are equity-settled share-based payments.
i Annual bonus compulsory and voluntary deferral into shares Half of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares which vest, subject to continued employment, after two years.
Where a participant has earned a bonus in respect of the bonus year and further Group performance criteria are met, participants may be invited to invest up to 25% of the value of their total bonus in Hilton Group plc shares which must then be held for three years.
The Group will match any percentage up to the 25% maximum voluntarily invested by a participant.
The matching shares vest after three years, subject to continued employment and the participant continuing to hold the shares purchased by their voluntarily investment.
ii Sharesave savings related Share Option Scheme This is a Sharesave scheme with options granted at a 20% discount to market value.
The scheme operates with either a 3, 5 or 7 years saving the last 7 year option was granted in 1999 with vesting after this time.
iii Share Incentive Plan Employees can contribute up to 75 per month to acquire Hilton Group plc shares.
For every two shares purchased, the Group provides a match of one additional share.
Annual Report and Accounts 79 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS continued 35 Share-based payments continued iv Share Options The options granted are all market value options with a three-year vesting period.
Vested options lapse if they have not been exercised within ten years of the date of grant.
All options have an EPS growth-based performance condition.
v Performance Share Plan PSP An award under the PSP consists of a notional allocation of shares which will vest, subject to the achievement of performance conditions at the end of the three-year period.
The performance conditions are set out below.
No dividends are paid to employees during the vesting period nor at the end of the period as dividend equivalents.
January 2002 Award The January 2002 award has a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition with an EPS underpin.
The EPS underpin requires the Company to achieve adjusted EPS growth which must exceed the growth in RPI by 6% over the performance period.
Based on the TSR condition, the full award vests if the TSR performance exceeds all the other companies in the FTSE100.
35% of the award vests if the Company ranks at median.
Between these two points there is straight-line vesting.
January 2003, January 2004 and January 2005 Awards The January 2003, January 2004 and January 2005 awards have two separate performance conditions: half of the award vests based on TSR and half of the award vests based on Return on Capital Employed ROCE for the Hotels division, and on Operating profit growth for the Betting and Gaming division.
For the TSR element, 100% of the award will vest if TSR ranks at 1st or 2nd against the customised comparator group, 40% vests for median, with straight-line vesting in between these points.
For the ROCE Operating profit element, 40% will vest for base performance and 100% vests for maximum performance.
For a more detailed description on each of the above options, refer to the Directors Remuneration Report.
