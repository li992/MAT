From 1 January 2005, Unilever has adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IAS 32 requires preference shares that provide for a xed preference dividend to be classied as borrowings and preference dividends to be recognised in the income statement as a finance cost.
IAS 39 requires unrealised fair value gains losses on certain financial instruments to be recognised in equity: when realised, these fair value gains losses are recognised in the income statement.
In accordance with the transition rules for first time adoption of IFRSs, 2004 comparatives have not been restated.
Information on the impact of the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 is given in note 23 on page 123.
Assets and liabilities held for sale are reported under IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which has been applied with effect from 1 January 2005: comparatives for 2004 have not been restated.
These financial statements were approved by the Directors on 28 February 2006.
