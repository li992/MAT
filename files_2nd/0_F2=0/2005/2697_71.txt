Post employment benefits The Company is a participating member of the Cadbury Schweppes Pension Fund and the Cadbury Schweppes Supplementary Pension Plan defined benefit plans created for the benefit of UK employees of the Group.
These plans are administered and funded on a Group basis, with contributions fixed based on the position of the overall fund.
It is not possible to identify the Companys share of the assets and liabilities in the schemes on a consistent and reasonable basis.
Therefore the Company has applied the provisions of FRS 17 to account for defined benefit plans as if they were defined contribution plans and no net surplus or deficit has been recorded on the Company balance sheet.
The Group schemes are currently in deficit.
Full details of the net liabilities of the total schemes and the assumptions used to determine this are included in Note 25 to the Group accounts.
