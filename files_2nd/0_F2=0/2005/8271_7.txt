translated into sterling at the rates of exchange on the balance These, together with Central functions, form the principal format by sheet date.
In the case of the US dollar, the translation rate is which management is organised and makes operational decisions.
In the case of the euro, the translation rate is 1 1.46 2004 1 1.41.
The Group further breaks each geographic region into three distinct business models which offer different growth, return, risk and reward opportunities: Franchised Where Group companies neither own nor manage the hotel, but license the use of a Group brand and provide access to reservation systems, loyalty schemes, and know-how.
The Group derives revenues from a brand royalty or licensing fee, based on a percentage of room revenue.
Managed Where, in addition to licensing the use of a Group brand, a Group company manages the hotel for third party owners.
The Group derives revenues from base and incentive management fees and provides the system infrastructure necessary for the hotel to operate.
Management contract fees are generally a percentage of hotel revenue and may have an additional incentive fee linked to profitability or cash flow.
The terms of these agreements vary, but are often long-term for example, 10 years or more.
The Groups responsibilities under the management agreement typically include hiring, training and supervising the managers and employees that operate the hotels under the relevant brand standards.
In order to gain access to central reservation systems, global and regional brand marketing and brand standards and procedures, owners are typically required to make a further contribution.
Owned and leased Where a Group company both owns or leases and operates the hotel and, in the case of ownership, takes all the benefits and risks associated with ownership.
The Group has sold, or plans to sell, the majority of its owned and leased portfolio and in future expects to only own hotels where it is considered strategically important to do so.
Segmental results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Soft Drinks Manufactures a variety of soft drink brands with distribution concentrated mainly in the UK.

A number of criteria are applied when deciding whether pre-approval for such services should be given.
These include the nature of the service, the level of fees, and the practicality of appointing an alternative provider, having regard to the skills and experience required to supply the service effectively.
Cumulative fees for audit and non-audit services are presented to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis for review.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring adherence to the pre-approval policy.

9 EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year available for IHG equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares, excluding investment in own shares, in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by adjusting basic earnings per ordinary share to reflect the notional exercise of the weighted average number of dilutive ordinary share options outstanding during the year.
The resulting weighted average number of dilutive ordinary shares is 533 million 2004 718 million.
Shareholder approval was given on 1 June 2005 to recommended proposals for the return of approximately 1bn to shareholders by way of a capital reorganisation by means of a Scheme of Arrangement under Section 425 of the Companies Act 1985.
Under the arrangement, shareholders received 11 new ordinary shares and 24.75 cash in exchange for every 15 existing ordinary shares held on 24 June 2005.
The overall effect of the transaction was that of a share repurchase at fair value, therefore no adjustment has been made to comparative data.

The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates and growth rates.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
Growth rates are based on both management development plans and industry growth forecasts.
Americas managed and franchised operations The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following four years based on an estimated growth rate of 4% 2004 5%.
After this period, the terminal value of future cash flows is calculated based on a perpetual growth rate of approximately 2% 2004 2%.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flow ranges from 10.0% to 10.5% 2004 10.0% to 10.5%.
Asia Pacific managed and franchised operations The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following four years based on an estimated growth rate of 4% 2004 7%.
After this period, the terminal value of future cash flows is calculated based on a perpetual growth rate of approximately 4% 2004 4%.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 11.0% 2004 11.0%.
The reduction in growth rates from 2004 is a result of the completion of several sale and manage back transactions in 2005 which had previously been included in forecast growth rates.

Listed equity share valuation is based on observable market prices.
Other financial assets consist mainly of trade deposits made in the normal course of business.
The deposits have been designated as loans and receivables and are held at amortised cost.
The fair value has been calculated by discounted future cash flows using prevailing interest rates.

The plan covers approximately 400 employees, of which 240 are in the defined benefit section and 160 are in the defined contribution section.
The assets of the plan are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Groups assets.
The Group also maintains a US-based InterContinental Hotels Pension Plan and post-employment benefits scheme.
This plan is now closed to new members and pensionable service no longer accrues for current employee members.
In addition, the Group operates a number of minor pension schemes outside the UK, the most significant of which is a defined contribution scheme in the US: there is no material difference between the pension costs of, and contributions to, those schemes.
On 14 December 2005, the Soft Drinks business, including the Britvic Pension Plan, was sold.

Tax losses with a value of 282m 2004 305m, including capital losses with a value of 93m 2004 98m, have not been recognised as their use is uncertain or not currently anticipated.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
Deferred tax assets of 19m 2004 4m in respect of share-based payments, 7m 2004 10m in respect of employee benefits and 11m 2004 nil in respect of other items have not been recognised as their use is uncertain or not currently anticipated.
At 31 December 2005, the Group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries.
Quantifying the temporary differences is not practical.
However, based on current enacted law and on the basis that the Group is in a position to control the timing and realisation of these temporary differences, no material tax consequences are expected to arise.

Variations in regular pension costs are amortised over the average expected service life of current employees on a straight line basis.
Scheme assets and liabilities are not recognised on the Groups balance sheet.
Under IFRS, the cost of providing defined benefit retirement benefits is recognised over the service life of scheme members.
This cost is calculated by an independent qualified actuary, based on estimates of long-term rates of return on scheme assets and discount rates on scheme liabilities.
Under UK GAAP, the cost of share-based payments is expensed based on the intrinsic value method over the performance period of each plan.
Under IFRS, the fair value of all share-based payments is expensed over the vesting period of the related equity instruments, based on the Groups best estimate of the number of shares that will vest.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using option pricing models applied to all share-based payments granted after 7 November 2002.
Depreciation and amortisation Under UK GAAP, goodwill is amortised over 20 years.
Under IFRS, goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing and is not amortised.
Under IFRS, assets classified as held for sale are not subject to depreciation from the date the assets are designated as held for sale.

Income tax expense Mainly attributable to tax on impairment of property, plant and equipment previously recorded against the revaluation reserve under UK GAAP and the presentation of tax on disposal of assets.
Loss gain on sale of assets Under IFRS, net asset carrying values have been reduced by the remeasurement of deferred tax, eliminating the provision for loss on disposal of operations recognised under UK GAAP.
