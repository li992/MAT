Final warrant exercise took place on 30 September 2004, resulting in the diluted NAV no longer being applicable.
April 2004 return has been restated to reflect the dilutive effect of potential Ordinary Shares.
`The Total Expense Ratio represents the annualised total expenses of the Company divided by the monthly average net assets of the Company for the year.
The increase is mainly attributed to the increase in irrecoverable VAT suffered by the Company.
# Large movement in the number of Ordinary Shares in Issue is due to the final warrant exercise that took place on 30 September 2004.
