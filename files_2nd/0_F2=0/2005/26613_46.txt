Derivatives and other financial instruments A discussion of the Groups strategies and policies with regards to derivatives and other financial instruments is given in the Business risk and Market risk sections of the Risk and risk management part of the Financial Review on pages 32 and 36.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption available, under FRS 13, for short-term debtors and creditors which are included in the consolidated balance sheet at amounts which are not significantly different from their fair values.
This means that these amounts are excluded from the following tables except for note 22 c. a Fair values and book values of financial instruments The comparison of fair and book values of all the Groups financial instruments is set out below.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year-end exchange rates.
