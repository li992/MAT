TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 1.
General information Overview Travis Perkins plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given on page 99.
The nature of the groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the chief executives review, the chief operating officers report and the finance directors report on pages 6 to 26.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling, the currency of the primary economic environment in which the group operates.
Statement of compliance For the first time the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulations.
As a result, the comparative amounts included in these financial statements have been restated under IFRS from the UK Financial Reporting Standard UK GAAP values originally published by the group.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRSs are given in note 38.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on the historic cost basis, except that derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries together referred to as the group from the date control commences until the date that control ceases.
Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
As such, the results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition.
The group has chosen to apply the permitted alternative treatment under IAS 19 Employee Benefits for recognising actuarial gains and losses in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The group has taken the exemption available in IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards not to restate comparatives for IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Despite taking advantage of the exemption the company believes that IAS 32 and IAS 39 would not have impacted the prior period.
In accordance with the transitional provisions available in IFRS 1, IFRS 2 Share-based Payments has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, the basis of accounting for pre-transition 1 January 2004 combinations under UK GAAP has not been revisited.
The initial carrying amount of assets and liabilities acquired in such business combinations is deemed to be equivalent to cost.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not yet been applied in these financial statements were in issue, but not yet effective: IFRS 6 Explanation for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures: IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease: IFRIC 5 Rights to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental: Rehabilitation Funds: IFRIC 6 Liabilities Arising from Participation in a Specific Market Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment: IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach Under IAS 29 Reporting in Hyper-inflationary Economies: IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2: IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives.
The directors anticipate that adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the group except for the additional disclosures on capital or financial instruments when the relevant Standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
Significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in preparing the financial statements are set out below.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when goods or services are received by the customer and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to them.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and value added tax.
Business combinations and goodwill All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of an acquisition represents the cash value of the consideration and or the fair value of the shares issued on the date the offer became unconditional, plus expenses.
At the date of the acquisition an assessment is made of the aggregate fair value of the net assets acquired.
It is this fair value, which is incorporated into the consolidated accounts.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the share of the aggregate fair value of identifiable net assets including intangible assets of a business or a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset and allocated to cash generating units, then at least annually, is reviewed for impairment.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed, as such, goodwill is stated in the balance sheet at cost less any provisions for impairment in value.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets identified as part of the assets of an acquired business are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition.
Intangible assets are amortised to the income statement on a straight-line basis over a maximum of 20 years except where they are considered to have an indefinite useful life.
In the latter instance they are reviewed annually for impairment.
Investment properties Investment properties, which are held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both, are stated at deemed cost less depreciation.
Properties are depreciated to their estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, up to a maximum of 50 years.
Rental income from investment property is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Assets are depreciated to their estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Buildings 50 years or if lower, the estimated useful life of the building or the life of the lease Plant and equipment 4 to 10 years Land is not depreciated Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, or where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds net of expenses and the carrying amount of the asset in the balance sheet and is recognised in the income statement.
Where appropriate, the attributable revaluation reserve remaining in respect of properties revalued prior to the adoption of IFRS is transferred directly to accumulated profits.
Significant accounting policies continued Leases Finance leases, which transfer to the group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease rental payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Reverse lease premia and other incentives receivable for entering into a lease agreement are recognised in the income statement over the life of the lease.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill The carrying amounts of the groups tangible and intangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If such an indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and compared to its carrying value.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs.
Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount a provision for the impairment loss is established with a charge being made to the income statement.
For intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life the recoverable amount is estimated at each annual balance sheet date.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of a CGU are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
Inventories Inventories, which consist of goods for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of disposal.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost which is carrying amount less provision for irrecoverable amounts.
Allowances for the estimated irrecoverable amounts are made in the income statement when the receivable is considered to be uncollectable.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank and other borrowings Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts and other loans are recognised in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
Costs associated with arranging a bank facility are recognised in the income statement over the life of the facility.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Trade payables Trade payables are measured at amortised cost.
Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates ruling on the date of the transaction.
At the consolidated balance sheet date, unhedged monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Significant accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks arising from financing activities.
The group does not enter into speculative financial instruments.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is the estimated amount the group would receive or pay to terminate the derivative at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest and exchange rates and the current creditworthiness of the counterparties.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, that are designated and effective as hedges of the future variability of cash flows, are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value of a hedged item, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in the income statement.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the income statement as they arise.
Derivatives embedded in commercial contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the underlying contracts, with unrealised gains or losses being reported in the income statement.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and the deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items which are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
This is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits For defined benefit schemes, operating profit is charged with the cost of providing pension benefits earned by employees in the period.
The expected return on pension scheme assets less the interest on pension scheme liabilities is shown as a finance cost within the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses arising in the period from the difference between actual and expected returns on pension scheme assets, experience gains and losses on pension scheme liabilities and the effects of changes in demographics and financial assumptions are included in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Recoverable pension scheme surpluses and pension scheme deficits and the associated deferred tax balances are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and are included in the balance sheet.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Employee share incentive plans The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees long term incentives, executive share options and Save As You Earn, which do not include market related conditions.
These payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant by the use of the Black Scholes option-pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The cost of equity-settled awards is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the groups estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
No cost is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
59 Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Significant accounting policies continued Equity instruments and own shares Equity instruments represent the ordinary share capital of the group and are recorded at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable incremental issue costs.
Consideration paid by the group for its own shares is deducted from total shareholder equity.
Where such shares vest to employees under the terms of the groups share options or the groups share saving schemes or are sold, any consideration received is included in shareholder equity.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the board of directors and unpaid at the period end are not recognised in the financial statements until they have been approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting.
Accounting estimates and judgements The audit committee have been party to discussions about the development, selection and disclosure of the groups critical accounting policies and estimates and about their actual application.
The key estimates made by management are detailed below: Goodwill In testing for impairment, management have made certain assumptions concerning the future development of the business that are consistent with its annual budget and three-year plan.
Should these assumptions regarding the growth in profitability be unfounded then it is possible that goodwill included in the balance sheet could be impaired.
Management are confident that this is not the case.
Pension liabilities The group has chosen to adopt assumptions that are more conservative than average, particularly in respect of longevity.
If the future return on equities is lower than anticipated, or if the difference between actual inflation and the actual increase in pensionable salaries is greater than that assumed, or if the average life expectancy of pensioners increases, then the pension deficit would be greater than currently stated in the balance sheet.
Property leases The group is party to a number of leases on properties that are no longer required for trading.
Whilst every effort is made to profitably sub-let these properties, it is not always possible.
Where a lease is onerous to the group, a provision is established for the difference between amounts contractually payable to the landlord and amounts contractually receivable from the tenant if any for the period up until the point it is judged that the lease will no longer be onerous.
Management believe that their estimates, which are based upon the current state of the UK property market are appropriate.
However, it is possible that it may take longer to dispose of leases than they anticipate.
As a result the provisions may be understated, but in the opinion of the directors this is unlikely to be material.
Insurance provisions The group has been substantially self-insured since 2001.
The nature of insurance claims is that they frequently take many years to fully crystalise, therefore the directors have to estimate the value of provisions to hold in the balance sheet in respect of historic claims.
Under the guidance of the groups insurance advisors, the value of incurred claims is estimated using the Generalised Cape Cod Method.
The provision is determined by deducting the value of claims settled to date from the estimated level of claims incurred.
Whilst the Generalised Cape Cod Method is an insurance industry standard methodology, it relies on historic trends to determine the level of expected claims.
To the extent that the estimates are inaccurate the group may be underprovided, but in the opinion of the directors any under-provision is unlikely to be material.

61 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC 6. Business and geographical segments For management purposes, the group is currently organised into two operating divisions Builders Merchanting and DIY Retailing, both of which operate entirely in the United Kingdom.
These divisions are the basis on which the group reports its primary segment information.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to segments as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items comprise mainly interest bearing loans, borrowings and expenses and corporate assets and expenses.
There are no inter-segment sales or charges.

Pension arrangements Defined benefit schemes During the year, the group operated two final salary schemes: the Travis Perkins Pensions and Dependants Benefit Scheme TP, which is th a 1 60 scheme, and the Wickes Group Retirement Benefits Plan Wickes, the assets of which were held in separate trustee administered funds.
The TP scheme is funded by contributions from the group companies and the employees, and the Wickes scheme, which is now closed, is funded by employer contributions only.
Contributions are paid to the trustees on the basis of advice from independent professionally qualified actuaries who carry out a valuation of each scheme every three years.
Employees are entitled to start drawing a pension, based on their membership of a scheme, on their normal retirement date.
If employees choose to retire early and draw their pension, then the amount they receive is scaled down accordingly.
A full actuarial valuation of the TP scheme was carried out on 30 September 2005, then updated to 31 December 2005 by a qualified actuary.
A full actuarial valuation of the Wickes scheme was carried out as at 1 April 2005.
This was backdated to 11 February 2005, the date of acquisition, and updated to 31 December 2005 by a qualified actuary.
The present values of the defined obligations, the related current service costs and the past service costs for both schemes were measured using the projected unit method.

Share-based payments Details of the share option schemes run by the company, including information concerning vesting periods, amounts outstanding and the exercise price are contained in the directors remuneration report on pages 43 and 44.
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to calculate the fair value of the options and the amount to be expensed.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
The inputs into the model expressed as weighted averages are as follows: Executive options SAYE 2005 2004 2005 2004 Share price at grant date pence group 1,601 1,329 1,265 1,406 Option exercise price pence group 1,601 1,329 1,159 1,156 Share price at grant date pence company 1,659 1,359 1,265 1,406 Option exercise price pence company 1,659 1,359 1,159 1,156 Volatility group and company 16.4% 18.8% 22.0% 20.5% Option life years group and company 4.0 4.0 3.8 3.8 Risk-free interest rate group and company 4.6% 4.7% 4.4% 4.5% Expected dividends as a dividend yield group and company 1.9% 1.9% 2.0% 2.2% 66 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC 9.
Share-based payments continued Volatility was based on historic share prices over a period of time equal to the vesting period.
Option life used in the model has been based on options being exercised in accordance with historical patterns.
The risk-free interest rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds on a term consistent with the vesting period.
Dividends used are based on actual dividends where data is known and future dividends estimated using a dividend cover of 3 times.
It has also been assumed that performance conditions in respect of the executive share options and the share matching scheme will be met.

Share-based payments continued The Group and the Company Executive options were granted on 1 April 2005 and 30 September 2005.
SAYE options were granted on 1 December 2005.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates is 5.5 million for the group and 0.7 million for the company.
During 2004, executive options were granted on 16 March 2004 and SAYE options were granted on 1 December 2004.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates is 4.0 million for the group and 0.6 million for the company.

Dividends The Group and the Company Amounts were recognised in the financial statements as distributions to equity shareholders as follows: 2005 2004 m m Final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 21.0 pence 2003: 16.8 pence per ordinary share 25.3 19.0 Interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2005 of 11.0 pence 2004: 9.5 pence per ordinary share 13.3 11.0 Total dividends recognised during the year 38.6 30.0 The proposed final dividend of 23.0 pence per ordinary share in respect of the year ending 31 December 2005 was approved by the board on 7 March 2006.
As the final dividend has not yet been approved by shareholders, in accordance with IFRS, it has not been included in the balance sheet as a liability as at 31 December 2005.
It will be paid on 16 May 2006 to shareholders on the register on 21 April 2006.
There are no income tax consequences in respect of the dividends declared, but not recognised in the financial statements.

All other goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGU in the Builders Merchanting business segment.
With the exception of the Wickes business no individual CGU is significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
During the year management has carried out an impairment test for the goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets carried in the balance sheet.
No impairments were identified as a result of the review.
All of the recoverable amounts were based on value in use.
The key assumptions applied in the value in use calculations were: cash flow projections based on management approved budgets for 2006 and three-year plan for 2007 to 2009: the weighted average cost of capital WACC of the group of 7.52%: long-term forecast growth rates of 2.5% in line with the average long-term GDP growth trend, applied from 2009 onwards.
Whilst management is confident that its assumptions are appropriate, it is possible an impairment would be identified if any of the above key assumptions were changed significantly.
However, as they are all inextricably linked it is not possible to determine the impact of a significant change to one or more of them.
Other intangible assets The Group m Cost At 1 January 2005 Additions brand 162.5 At 31 December 2005 162.5 Prior to 11 February 2005 the group did not have any other intangible assets.
The brand is not amortised.
As a leading brand in the DIY sector, with significant growth prospects, it is considered to have an indefinite useful life and is reviewed annually for impairment.
Details of impairment testing are given in note 14.
In 2005 no impairments were identified.

Direct operating expenses were not significant.
As no external valuation has been performed, the directors have estimated that the fair value of investment property equates to its carrying value.
As such it is not material to the groups balance sheet.

The group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The average credit term for sales of goods is 48.0 days.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts of 19.0 million 2004: 17.3 million, estimated by the groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the company and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Included within cash and cash equivalents was nil million 2004: 0.7 million held by employee related trusts.
These funds could only be used to purchase ordinary shares in the company in order to satisfy obligations under the executive share options schemes and employee sharesave schemes or to provide other benefits to employees.

Excluding 999 year leases, the average loan term for these properties is 50 years and the average borrowing rate has been determined at the inception of the lease to be 8.9 per cent.
In addition the group leases certain of its fixtures and equipment under finance leases, the obligations for which are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.
The average lease term is 34 years.
For the year ended 31 December 2005, the average implicit borrowing rate was 14.2 per cent 2004: 15.6 per cent.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date.
All lease obligations, which are denominated in Sterling, are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
e Loan notes Included in borrowings due within the year are 8.2 million 2004: 9.0 million in respect of loan notes issued as consideration for the acquisition of two groups during 1999 and 2000.
The loan notes of 4.5 million issued in 1999 to acquire Sharpe & Fisher can be redeemed on 1 January and 1 July each year, the final redemption date being 1 January 2010.
The 3.7 million of loan notes issued for the acquisition of the business of Broombys Limited are redeemable on 30 June and 31 December each year until the final redemption date of 30 June 2015. f Interest The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows: 2005 2004 % % Bank loans and overdrafts 5.5 4.9 Other borrowings 4.9 4.7 Bank term loans and revolving credit facilities of 1.2 billion 2004: 120 million were arranged at variable interest rates.
This exposed the group to fair value interest rate risk.
As detailed in note 25, to manage the risk the group entered into amortising interest rate swap arrangements to fix interest rates on 351.5 million of borrowing during 2005.
For the year to 31 December 2005 this had the effect of increasing the weighted average interest rates paid by 0.05%.
Borrowings continued In respect of income earning financial assets and interest bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they reprice.

There were no significant differences between book and fair values on this basis and therefore no further information is disclosed.
Details about the fair values of derivatives are given in note 25. h Guarantees and security No debt is secured, except for that relating to 3.6 million 2004: nil million of finance lease obligations, which are secured on the assets subject to the leases.
There are cross guarantees on the overdrafts between group companies.
The companies listed in note 18, together with Wickes Limited are guarantors of the following facilities advanced to Travis Perkins plc: 500 million term loan: 700 million revolving credit facility: $400 million US private placement note 24i : The interest rate and currency swaps, detailed in note 25.
The group companies have entered into other guarantee and counter-indemnities arrangements in respect of guarantees issued in favour of group companies by the clearing banks amounting to approximately 14 million 2004: 12 million.
Borrowings continued i Post balance sheet debt restructuring On 26 January 2006 the group finalised a US private placement that resulted in it receiving $400 million and repaying 230 million of the term loan.
$200 million of the US borrowing is repayable in January 2013 and $200 million in January 2016.
The US borrowings carry fixed rate coupons of between 130 bps and 140 bps over US treasuries.
As described in note 25, to protect itself from currency movements and bring interest rate exposures back into line with the groups desired risk profile the group entered into five cross currency swaps.
Derivative financial instruments Interest rate swaps The group adopts a policy of ensuring that its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowing is either on a fixed rate basis or is subject to movements within pre-defined limits.
To achieve its desired interest rate profile the group uses interest rate swaps and interest rate collars.
During 2005, as part of their interest rate management process, the group and the company became party to two amortising interest rate swaps, one amortising interest rate floor option and an interest rate cap option.
The two interest rate swaps each have a notional value of 180 million and 171.5 million respectively.
The interest rate cap and floor options provide a collar on 171.5 million of borrowings.
Contracts with nominal values of 343 million have fixed interest payments at an average rate of 4.95 per cent for periods up until February 2010 and have floating interest receipts at nil per cent plus LIBOR.
At 31 December 2005 the fair value of interest rate derivatives, all of which terminate approximately 4 years from the balance sheet date, to which the group and the company were parties was estimated at 5.1 million 2004: nil million.
This amount is based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
All of these interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity.
An amount of 0.6 million in respect of the fair value movement on the collar 2004: nil million has been taken to the income statement as the company has not applied hedge accounting.
Currency swaps In order to eliminate the currency risk associated with the $400 million private placement described in note 24i, the group and the company have entered into five cross currency swaps in varying amounts between 23 million and 63 million to fix the exchange rate at 1 equal to $1.73 for the entire life of the private placement, although there is a mutual break clause on each swap on 1 December 2010.
The forward options fix the notional amount receivable and payable in respect of the private placement to 231 million as well as fixing the exchange rate applicable to future coupon payments.
The currency swaps manage the groups and the companys exposure to the fixed interest rate on the US dollar denominated borrowing arising out of a private placement on 26 January 2006.
There are two interest rate swaps of 58 million that convert the borrowing rate on $200 million of debt from 5.77 per cent to a variable rate on 6 month LIBOR plus a weighted average basis point increment of 81.9.
At 26 January the variable rates were at 5.43 per cent and 5.43 per cent respectively.
A further three interest rate swaps of 29 million, 23 million and 63 million convert the borrowing rates on $50 million, $40 million and $110 million of debt from 5.89 per cent to a variable rate based on six month LIBOR plus basis point increment of 86.5, 86.7 and 86.05 respectively.
At 26 January 2006 the variable rates were at 5.47 weighted average per cent.
At 31 December the fair value of currency derivatives, all of which terminate more than five years after the balance sheet date, was estimated at 1.3 million 2004: nil million.
This amount is based upon the market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
All of these currency swaps are designated and effective as fair value hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity.

It is group policy to substantially self insure itself against claims arising in respect of damage to assets, or due to employers or public liability claims.
The nature of insurance claims means they may take some time to be settled.
The insurance claims provision represents managements best estimate, based on external advice, of the value of outstanding insurance claims where the final settlement date is uncertain.
Deferred tax The Group The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting period.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 81 group can utilise the losses.
Deferred tax continued Other than disclosed in the previous table, no deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The group has recognised a deferred tax asset of 42.9 million 2004: 38.5 million in respect of the deficits on its pension schemes.
The directors believe that the deferred tax asset will be realised as the deficits are reduced over the coming years.

Acquisition of businesses On 11 February 2005, the group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Wickes Limited for cash consideration of 1,009.7 million.
This transaction has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting.

In the ten and a half months to 31 December 2005, Wickes contributed operating profit of 55.9 million and profit before tax of 52.7 million to the groups 2005 profits.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2005, group revenue would have been 2,726 million and net profit would have been 141.9 million.
In addition to the profit before tax of 52.7 million, the Wickes acquisition contributed 4.7 million of identifiable synergy benefits arising from specific integration projects to the existing builders merchanting business and increased group finance costs by 48.6 million.
The total identifiable pre-tax impact of Wickes was 8.8 million as disclosed in the income statement.
Acquisition of businesses continued Other acquisitions In addition, during the year the group acquired 9 limited companies and the assets of 8 other businesses, details of which on an individual basis are not material to the financial statements.
All the acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.

The acquired subsidiary companies are now dormant.
The individual results and cash flow effects of the acquired businesses are not sufficiently material to warrant separate disclosure.
The acquired branches have now been fully integrated into the Travis Perkins group accounting systems.
As such, the directors are unable to calculate meaningful cash flow effects of each of the other acquired businesses for the period of Travis Perkins ownership without incurring undue expense and delay.
Goodwill arising on acquisition The goodwill arising on the acquisitions made during the year is attributable to the anticipated profitability of these acquisitions and the future operating synergies arising in the enlarged group.
As described in note 15, 162.5 million was attributed to the brand value of Wickes.
No other significant intangible assets were acquired during the year.
Prior period acquisitions The provisional fair values ascribed to the net assets of acquisitions made during 2004 and disclosed in the 2004 financial statements were finalised during the year.
There were no significant changes to the values disclosed last year.
Post year end acquisitions There have been no material acquisitions since the year end.
Operating lease arrangements The group leases a number of trading properties under operating leases.
The leases are typically 25 years in duration, although some have lessee only break clauses of between 10 and 15 years.
Lease payments are reviewed every five years and increases applied in line with market rates.
The group also leases certain items of plant and equipment.

Explanation of transition to IFRS The reconciliations of equity at 1 January 2004 date of transition to IFRS and at 31 December 2004 date of last UK GAAP financial statements have been included below to enable a comparison of the 2005 published consolidated figures with those published in the corresponding period of the previous financial year.
In addition, there is also the reconciliation of the UK GAAP profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 to the profit restated under IFRS.
Other than causing a restatement of the format, the introduction of IFRS has not significantly impacted the consolidated cash flow statement or the numbers contained therein.
The significant changes as a result of the transition to IFRS and of adopting the IFRS group accounting policies are described below.
IFRS 2 Share-based payments In accordance with IFRS 2, the group has recognised a charge reflecting the fair value of outstanding share options granted to employees since 7 November 2002.
The fair value has been calculated using the Black Scholes valuation model and is charged to profit over the relevant option vesting period, adjusted to reflect actual and expected levels of vesting.
The impact of this change on the group has been a charge of 1.4m to operating profit for the year to 31 December 2004.
For the company the charge to operating profit for 2004 was 0.2m.
IFRS 3 Business combinations IFRS 3 prohibits the amortisation of goodwill.
The standard requires goodwill to be carried at cost less impairment.
Impairment reviews should be carried out annually and also when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the group has chosen to apply IFRS 3 prospectively from 1 January 2004, the date of transition, and has chosen not to restate previous business combinations.
Therefore, goodwill is stated in the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2004 at its UK GAAP carrying value of 285.7m with the subsequent 2004 amortisation being reversed.
The impact on operating profit is a credit of 17.4m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date Under IAS 10, a provision should only be recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation to transfer resources.
For the Travis Perkins plc group, no such obligation to pay a dividend exists until the shareholders give formal approval to the proposed dividend at the annual general meeting.
Therefore under IFRS, the group will no longer accrue unapproved dividends at period ends.
This has resulted in an increase in net assets of 19.0m at 1 January 2004, the opening balance sheet date, and 25.3m at 31 December 2004.
For the company, dividends from subsidiary undertakings are no longer accrued.
This has resulted in a reduction of net assets of 26.0 million at 1 January 2004 and 29.8 million at 31 December 2004.
For 2004, operating profits were reduced by 3.8m.
IAS 12 Income taxes IAS 12 requires entities to calculate deferred taxation based on temporary differences, which are defined as the difference between the carrying amount of assets liabilities and their tax base.
As a result, the group has provided an additional 19.1m of deferred tax liabilities in its opening balance sheet, and 18.8m at 31 December 2004 that were not required under UK GAAP.
These arise from the potential tax gains on the revaluation of fixed assets, on certain acquired buildings that do not qualify for industrial building allowances and from the effect of implementing IFRS 2.
Where required, deferred tax has been provided on all other IFRS adjustments.
IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment In accordance with IFRS 1, the group has elected, where appropriate, to use the revaluation carrying amount of certain properties as the deemed cost on transition to IFRS.
IAS 17 Leases Under IAS 17, a lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
Assets held under finance leases and the related lease obligations are recorded in the balance sheet at the lower of the fair value of the property and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the leases.
The impact of the new standard means that a number of property leases will now be capitalised.
This has resulted in an increase to fixed assets of 14.4m and creditors of 18.5m giving a net decrease to net assets of 4.1m and a credit of 1.0m to operating profit for the year to 31 December 2004.
In accordance with IAS 17 lease incentives are treated as a reduction in rental expense over the term of the lease.
Therefore, under IAS the group will not be allowed to reflect the benefit of these incentives over a shorter period should the lease rental be adjusted to reflect market rates.
This change in policy only has an effect on the group in 2005.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued IAS 19 Employee benefits As the group has an obligation to its employees to pay accrued holiday entitlement, IAS 19 requires it to accrue for holidays earned by its employees, but not taken by the balance sheet date.
The holiday pay year is co-terminus with the statutory year-end.
IAS 32 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation and IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement The group has elected not to apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 to periods ended on or prior to 31 December 2004.
The group has not identified any significant adjustments that would be required to prior periods if IAS 32 and IAS 39 were applied retrospectively.
IAS 40 Investment properties IAS 40 allows the group to recognise investment properties at cost and depreciate them over their estimated useful lives or at fair value.
The group has chosen to adopt the cost model with the result that operating profits for the year ended 31 December 2004 were reduced by 0.1m.
The carrying value of investment properties at 31 December 2004 was increased by 0.3m to 4.2m after depreciation.
In accordance with the transitional rules set out in IFRS 1 the cost of investment properties held at 1 January 2004 is deemed to be the same as the fair value of the properties at that date.
