The Group holds various financial instruments in order to manage interest rate risk.
Details of those financial instruments held at the year end are given in Note 17 viii.
The Group reported issue costs directly attributable to new debt instruments in the prior year as a reduction from the proceeds, as required by FRS4 Capital Instruments.

Taxation 2005 2004 m m i Analysis of tax charge in year Current tax: UK corporation tax 4.3 5.3 Double taxation relief 4.3 5.3 Withholding tax 7.1 9.5 Other foreign tax 28.2 17.4 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 6.9 2.8 Total current tax 28.4 24.1 Deferred tax: Origination and reversal of timing differences 2.8 4.5 Others: Associated undertakings 0.1 Tax on profit on ordinary activities 31.2 19.7 ii Factors affecting current tax charge for year Profit loss on ordinary activities before tax 91.8 52.8 Tax at weighted average rate 36.6 20.4 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 24.1 60.3 Timing differences 3.3 2.5 Utilisation of tax losses and other credits, principally in the US 45.0 59.2 Origination of tax losses 15.7 39.2 Withholding tax and other 0.3 6.7 Total current tax 28.4 24.1 The weighted average tax rate is calculated by applying statutory tax rates to actual taxable profits and losses in the countries of operation.
The prior-year UK corporation tax charge included the attributable taxation charge relating to non-operating exceptional items falling within the UK tax jurisdiction.
iii Factors that may affect future tax charges No provision has been made for deferred tax where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets, except where there is a commitment to dispose of these assets.
Such gains would only become taxable if the assets were sold without it being possible to claim roll-over relief or offset existing capital losses.
The Group does not expect any such tax to become payable in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of tax on gains arising from the revaluation of fixed assets, as the Group is not committed to the disposal of these assets.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no dividends have been accrued.
Deferred tax assets which have not been recognised are tax losses and credits with a value of 124.2m, capital allowances in advance of depreciation with a value of 8.8m, and other timing differences with a value of 12.7m, as there is insufficient certainty as to the availability of future taxable profits.

On conversion each US$ principal amount is converted into one Preference Share of a paid-up value of US$1,000.
The Preference Share will, in turn, be immediately exchangeable for Ordinary Shares in EMI Group plc.
The number of Ordinary Shares for which a Preference Share may be exchanged will be determined by dividing the paid-up value of the Preference Share, translated into Sterling at a fixed rate of US$1.5957, by the exchange price initially set at 193.38p per Ordinary Share.
Conversion by the holder at 193.38p per Ordinary Share may occur after 11 November 2003 until seven days prior to the final redemption date.
Conversion by the issuer, after 16 October 2007, of all but not part, may occur if the average price per Ordinary Share on at least 20 dealing days in any period of 30 consecutive dealing days has been 130p: or at any time if 85% or more of the aggregate principal amount has been previously purchased, redeemed or cancelled.
Redemption by the issuer, after 16 October 2007, may occur if the same conditions which apply to conversion by the issuer are met.
Final redemption is on 2 October 2010 at 100% of principal and accrued interest.

Derivatives and other financial instruments continued iii Currency exposures As explained on page 36 in the Financial review, the Groups objective in managing currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas its structural currency exposures is to maintain appropriate levels of borrowings by currency to hedge partially against currency depreciation.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The table below shows the Groups currency exposures, being those trading assets and liabilities or non-structural exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain non-Sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.
These exposures were as follows: At 31 March 2005 Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities Sterling US Dollar Yen Euro Other Functional currency of Group operation m m m m m Sterling n a 0.2 0.9 10.7 14.2 US Dollar 0.2 n a 0.3 0.1 2.3 Yen 1.3 1.9 n a 0.8 0.3 Euro 0.7 0.4 n a 0.6 Other 2.2 0.9 5.1 2.7 1.2 Total 3.0 0.4 3.9 7.1 16.2 At 31 March 2004 Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities Sterling US Dollar Yen Euro Other Functional currency of Group operation m m m m m Sterling n a 6.6 9.1 8.7 15.1 US Dollar 3.5 n a 0.4 0.4 Yen 0.5 0.2 n a 0.2 Euro 9.5 2.8 0.1 n a 1.4 Other 3.8 0.6 5.3 0.2 Total 8.7 10.2 3.7 8.5 16.3 iv Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, other than short-term creditors such as trade creditors and accruals, was as follows: 2005 2004 m m In one year or less, or on demand 30.0 35.8 In more than one year but not more than two years 2.5 3.6 In more than two years but not more than five years 634.5 391.0 In more than five years 415.2 676.4 Total 1,082.2 1,106.8 87 Notes to the financial statements continued 17.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued v Undrawn facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31 March in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows: 2005 2004 m m Expiring in one year or less 116.4 14.4 Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years Expiring in more than two years 236.9 242.8 Total 353.3 257.2 vi Fair values of financial assets liabilities 2005 2004 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations: Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term borrowings 13.6 13.6 35.8 35.8 Long-term borrowings 1,058.4 1,228.2 1,058.1 1,270.1 Liquid funds 242.5 242.5 345.2 345.2 Other financial liabilities 10.2 10.2 12.9 12.9 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate and currency profile: Interest rate swaps 8.3 12.6 Interest rate caps and collars Currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts Financial assets: Financial assets listed investments 3.5 4.3 1.6 2.1 Financial assets other 94.4 94.4 106.1 106.1 Market rates have been used to determine fair values.
Long-term borrowings include US$500m 8.375% Guaranteed Notes book value 263.2m with a fair value of 286.8m and E425m 8.625% Senior Notes book value 285.3m with a fair value of 347.0m.
The Group holds equivalent US Dollar and Euro nominal value interest rate swaps matching the coupon on both the US$ Notes and Euro Bond, effectively converting the interest basis to floating rate set in arrears.
At 31 March 2005, these swaps had a fair value of 10.6 m and 18.9m respectively.
Long-term borrowings also include a Sterling Bond issue book value 322.1m, with a fair value of 349.9m, US$123.75m 6.96% Senior Notes book value 65.1m with a fair value of 39.4m and US$243.3m 5.25% guaranteed convertible bond issue book value 123.5m with a fair value of 205.9m.
The majority of other borrowings and liquid funds are short-term in nature and book values approximate to fair values.
For all other financial assets and liabilities, book values approximate to fair values.
vii Management of interest rate risk As explained on page 36 in the Financial review, the Groups policy is to manage interest rate risk, using interest rate swaps, caps and collars.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for managing interest rate risk, and the movements therein, are as follows: Total net Gains Losses gains losses m m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 April 2004 12.6 12.6 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised in 2005 Gains and losses arising before 1 April 2004 that were not recognised in 2005 12.6 12.6 Gains and losses arising in 2005 that were not recognised in 2005 9.1 13.4 4.3 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 March 2005 21.7 13.4 8.3 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2006 or later Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2007 or later 21.7 13.4 8.3 21.7 13.4 8.3 88 17.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued viii Financial instruments Interest rate agreements To manage interest rate riskthe Group has entered into certain interest rate swap agreements which, as at 31March 2005, were as follows: Notional Termination Fixed principal date rate Interest rate swaps: Euroreceive fixed rate and pay floating rate set in arrears E425m October 2013 8.63% US Dollarreceive fixed rate and pay floating rate set in arrears $500m August 2009 8.38% In February 2003, following a routine review of derivative positions in the prevailing market conditions, the Group unwound a US$500m interest swap position.
The swap effectively switched the 8.375% fixed coupon on the US$ Guaranteed Notes issued in August 1999 to a floating rate of interest.
The Group received a cash payment of US$86.2m 55.6m on the unwind, representing the present value of the expected cash savings from the swap as determined by the expected differential between US short-term and long-term interest rates, discounted at the prevailing market rate.
The gain from the unwind is being amortised over the remaining life of the Notes, thus locking in the future interest cost benefit to be obtained from the swap.
The swap unwind reduces the Groups overall interest rate risk.
Exchange rate agreements As at 31 March 2005, the Group had no currency swaps or forward foreign currency contracts outstanding.

Contingent liabilities The Group, along with other companies in the music and broadcast industries, has received requests from the New York State Attorney General for information regarding practices in connection with the promotion of records on New York state radio stations.
The Group is co-operating fully with this inquiry.
EMI has a long-standing, strict written policy prohibiting unlawful radio promotion practices, and that policy was reaffirmed internally in early 2004.
The inquiry is ongoing and, while it is not possible to be certain as to the eventual outcome, EMI is not currently aware of any reason for believing that there will be a material financial impact on the Group.
There are no other significant legal or arbitration proceedings, pending or threatened, against any member of the Group which, so far as the Directors are aware, are likely to result in a liability materially in excess of provisions in the financial statements.
Guarantees and other contingent liabilities total 33.3m 2004: 40.0m.
Such liabilities relating to HMV Group plc total 20.7m 2004: 22.1m and for the former Thorn rental business amount to 3.7m 2004: 9.4m : those in respect of Group companies total 8.9m 2004: 8.5m.
Following the demerger of the Thorn rental business in 1996, Group companies remained contingently liable in respect of guarantees given with regard to certain leases on properties occupied or previously occupied by the Thorn business though, as part of the demerger arrangements, Thorn Limited formerly called Thorn plc agreed to indemnify the Group against such liabilities.
One of the Group companies so liable was sold to HMV Group plc as part of the 1998 sale and the Company agreed to indemnify HMV Group plc against any such liabilities.
The current or former Thorn properties in respect of which the Group remained contingently liable number approximately 50 and the annual rental payments in respect of such properties total approximately 3.6m.
Following the insolvency of Thorn High Street Properties Limited and certain other companies, claims have arisen against the Group in respect of many of the guaranteed leases.
Such claims have been met by Thorn Limited pursuant to its agreement to indemnify the Group.
As part of the sale in 1998 to HMV Group plc HMV Group of the companies and assets comprising HMV, the Group entered into an indemnity deed with HMV Group relating, among other things, to guarantees given by the Group in respect of property leases of which approximately 75 2004: 79 remain outstanding.
Under the deed, HMV Group agreed to indemnify the Group against any payments made under those property leases and certain other guarantees and indemnities.
The aggregate annual rental payments under guaranteed leases are approximately 20.7m 2004: 22.1m, although they are subject to adjustment both up and down under certain circumstances.
The guaranteed leases have terms which expire in 10 to 21 years 2004: 22 years and 17 of the leases expire in years beyond 2015.
The indemnity deed remains in force in respect of lease guarantees, and HMV Group has secured those obligations pursuant to a security deed, the Companys rights under which rank second behind banks which provide senior credit facilities to HMV Group.
93 Notes to the financial statements continued 27.
Pension arrangements The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The main scheme, which covers employees in the UK, is the EMI Group Pension Fund the UK Fund.
The UK Fund is of the defined benefit type and is open to all permanent employees over the age of 18 employed by the Company and certain subsidiaries in the UK.
Benefits provided by the UK Fund are based on final pensionable pay.
Pensions payable from the UK Fund are guaranteed to increase by 5% per annum or, if a lower rate, by the increase in the cost of living.
Members contribute to the UK Fund at the rate of 4% of pensionable pay.
With effect from 1 April 2004, the Company has contributed a further 21% of pensionable pay.
Aside from the UK, the Group has significant defined benefit schemes in Germany and Japan.
With the exception of these schemes, the other defined benefit schemes operated on behalf of the Group are not material.
With the exception of the UK fund, the currently agreed rates of contribution by the Group are nil for all significant defined benefit schemes.
Staff engaged in other countries are covered by local arrangements which, in the case of the Group schemes, are of the defined contribution type.
The assets of the Groups pension schemes are held mainly in separate trustee-administered funds.
Employer contributions of 10.8m 2004: 12.6m were charged to the Profit and loss account in the year.
Other post-retirement benefit expenses of 0.1m 2004: 0.2m were also charged to the Profit and loss account.
Provision is made in the financial statements for the benefits accruing to members of unfunded pension schemes in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
The latest available actuarial valuation of the UK Fund was made by a qualified actuary as at 31 March 2003 using the projected unit method.
At that date and on the prudent funding basis used by the Trustee, the market value of the assets was sufficient to cover 91% of the value of the benefits that have accrued to the members, after allowing for assumed increases in earnings, on the actuarial assumptions used, treating the UK Fund as an ongoing entity.
Employer expense in respect of the UK Fund has been calculated in accordance with SSAP24.
On the basis of actuarial advice and using a realistic basis for SSAP24 purposes which resulted in the market value of assets being sufficient to cover 109% of the value of the benefits, it is calculated that the profit and loss charge for the year ended 31 March 2005 is nil 2004: nil.
For SSAP24 purposes we have used the following assumptions: % per annum Rate of investment return 6.80 Rate of pay increases 4.75 Rate of pension increases 2.75 Rate of price inflation 2.75 These rates included allowance for the effects of the tax credit changes introducted by the Finance No.
The most recent full actuarial valuations of the three significant defined benefit schemes were carried out as follows: UK on 31 March 2003, Germany on 1 April 2003 and Japan on 31 October 2003.
