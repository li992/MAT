Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31st December 2005 38 Retirement benefit obligations Pension schemes The UK Retirement Fund UKRF, which is the main scheme of the Group comprises five sections.
The 1964 Pension Scheme Most employees recruited before July 1997 are members of this non-contributory defined benefit scheme.
Pensions are calculated by reference to service and pensionable salary and are normally subject to a deduction from State pension age.
The Retirement Investment Scheme RIS A defined contribution plan for most joiners between July 1997 and 1st October 2003.
Between 5.5% and 13.5% of pensionable pay is credited to members retirement accounts in addition to contributions paid by the members themselves: precise amounts are dependent upon each members age and contribution decision.
This was closed to new entrants on 1st October 2003 and the large majority of existing members of the RIS transferred to afterwork in respect of future benefit accrual with effect from 1st January 2004.
There are now no longer any active members of the RIS.
The Pension Investment Plan PIP A defined contribution plan created from 1st July 2001 to provide benefits for certain employees of Barclays Capital.
10% of pay is credited to members retirement accounts.
afterwork Combines a contributory cash balance element with a voluntary defined contribution element.
New employees since 1st October 2003 are eligible to join afterwork.
In addition, the large majority of active members of the RIS now closed were transferred to afterwork in respect of future benefit accrual after 1st January 2004.
Career Average Section Career Average The Career Average Section was established in the UKRF with effect from 1st May 2004 following the transfer of the members from the Woolwich Pension Fund.
The Career Average Section is a non-contributory career average scheme and is open to new members who are employees of either the Clacton or FirstPlus call centres.
In addition, the costs of ill-health retirements and death in service benefits are generally borne by the UKRF for each of the five sections.
In addition to the UKRF, there are other defined benefit and defined contribution schemes in the UK and overseas.
Acquisition of Absa Employees are members of the Absa Group Pension Fund, which has a defined benefit and a defined contribution structure.
The defined benefit structure was closed to new entrants on 31st March 1997 with most members transferring to the defined contribution structure.
The IAS 19 pension surplus of the scheme as at 31st December 2005 was 90m.
A net IAS 19 liability of nil has been recognised on the balance sheet consisting of 335m defined benefit obligation and 335m fair value of plan assets.
These balances are not recognised in the financial statements of the Absa Group Limited in accordance with South African legislative requirements.
The following tables present an analysis of defined benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for all the Groups pension schemes and post-retirement benefits the latter are unfunded and present the amounts recognised in the income statement including those related to post-retirement healthcare.

The increased UKRF deficit is primarily attributable to the decrease in the discount rate reflecting the fall in AA corporate bond yields over the period.
This change in assumptions had the effect of increasing liabilities measured for IAS 19 purposes a little under 2bn which more than offset the 354m contribution and strong investment returns achieved over the year.
The actuarial funding position of the UKRF as at 31st December 2005, estimated from the formal triennial valuation in 2004, was a surplus of 900m 2004: deficit of 50m.

The assets of all the funded plans are held independently of the Groups assets in separate trustee administered funds.
Defined benefit schemes are valued by independent actuaries for accounting purposes using the projected unit credit method every year.
The latest actuarial valuations were carried out as at 31st December 2005 using the following assumptions: UK schemes Overseas schemes 2005 2004 2005 2004 % p. a.
Discount rate 4.8 5.4 1.0-25.0 1.5-24.5 Expected return on plan assets 5.3-7.1 5.3-7.3 0.8-25.0 0.8-25.5 Rate of increase in salaries 4.3 4.3 2.2-22.0 2.2-18.0 Rate of increase for pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.75 2.75 0.0-17.0 0.0-13.0 Initial health care inflation 10.0 10.0 7.5-11.0 7.5-11.0 Long-term health care inflation 5.0 5.0 5.0-7.5 5.0-7.5 The overseas health care inflation assumptions relate to the US and Mauritius.
Mortality assumptions The post-retirement mortality assumptions used in valuing the liabilities of the UKRF were based on the standard tables PA92 as published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
These were then adjusted in line with both current industry experience and the actual experience of the UKRFs own pensioners relative to the standard table.
On this basis, the life expectancy assumed at 31st December 2005 for a male pensioner then aged 60 was 25.8 years and for a female pensioner then aged 60 was 29.5 years.
Based on the assumed mortality improvements, by 31st December 2025 the life expectancy for a male pensioner then aged 60 will have increased to 27.1 years and for a female then aged 60 years will have increased to 30.6 years.
The expected return on assets is determined by calculating a total return estimate based on weighted average estimated returns for each asset class.
Asset class returns are estimated using current and projected economic and market factors such as inflation, credit spreads and equity risk premiums.
The actual return on plan assets was 2,499m 2004: 1,413m.
The experience adjustments arising on plan liabilities and plan assets is as follows: UK schemes Overseas schemes Total 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 m m m m m m Fair value of plan assets 15,571 13,261 819 436 16,390 13,697 Present value of obligations 18,252 15,574 1,017 587 19,269 16,161 Net deficit in the plans 2,681 2,313 198 151 2,879 2,464 Actuarial losses arising on benefit obligation 2,042 1,204 32 62 2,074 1,266 arising on benefit obligation % plan liabilities 11% 8% 3% 11% 11% 8% Actuarial gains arising on plan assets 1,599 570 2 9 1,601 579 arising on plan assets % of plan assets 10% 4% 2% 10% 4% Post-retirement health care A one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates, assuming all other assumptions remain constant would have the following effects for 2005: 1% increase 1% decrease m m Effect on total of service and interest cost components 0.8 0.6 Effect on post-retirement benefit obligation 20.5 25.0 3.5 Notes a In certain circumstances, derivatives mainly total return swaps are used to derive changes in investment strategy in advance of the sales and purchases of assets in accordance with the Schemes investment strategy.
The percentage of fair value of Scheme assets is based on the derivatives together with their related underlying asset, where necessary to reflect the investment strategy of the scheme.
