Cash and cash equivalents and collateralised cash largely attract floating interest rates.
Accordingly, their carrying amounts are considered to approximate to fair value.
Borrowings classified as current liabilities mainly comprise overdrafts and loans that attract floating interest rates.
Accordingly their carrying amount is considered to approximate to fair value.
Borrowings classified as non-current liabilities principally comprise borrowings under the Groups multi-currency revolving credit facility that attract floating interest rates, whose carrying amount is considered to approximate to fair value, and the listed bonds issued under the Groups Euro Medium Term Note Programme, whose fair values represent their quoted market prices.
Finance lease obligations attract fixed interest rates that are implicit in the lease rentals and their fair value has been assessed by reference to prevailing market interest rates.
Interest rate derivatives are valued by discounting the applicable cash flows at prevailing market interest rates.
Foreign currency derivatives are valued on a mark to market basis by reference to prevailing currency exchange rates.
The Convertible cumulative preference shares are not traded in an organised market and their fair value has been assessed using a valuation model that takes into account prevailing market interest rates and the existence of the holders conversion option.
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005 96 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH IFRS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 31.
BACKGROUND The Group operates pension plans throughout the world, covering the majority of its employees.
The plans are structured to accord with local conditions and practices in each country and include defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.
The Group provides defined contribution pension benefits in most of the countries in which it operates: in particular, the majority of Groups employees in the United States of America are entitled to such benefits.
The expense recognised in the income statement in respect of these plans represents the contributions payable by the Group for the period at rates that are specified in the rules of the plans.
As at 31 December 2005, the Group had not paid over to the plans contributions due amounting to 7.4 million 1 January 2005 5.6 million.
All amounts due for the period were paid over subsequent to the balance sheet date.
The Group operates defined benefit pension plans in several countries: in particular, in the United Kingdom and the United States of America.
Generally, the pension benefits provided under these plans are based upon pensionable salary and the period of service of the individual employees.
The assets of the plans are held separately from those of the Group in funds that are under the control of trustees.
The defined benefit pension plans operated by the Group are closed to new entrants.
In addition to the funded defined benefit pension plans, the Group has unfunded defined benefit obligations to certain employees.
The Group also provides other post-employment benefits, principally health and life insurance cover, to certain of its employees in North America.
These plans, which are unfunded, are defined benefit plans.
SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL EFFECT An analysis of the effect of post-employment benefits on the Groups results and financial position is set out below.

The return and risk expectations for each asset class incorporate assumptions about historical return relationships, current financial market conditions and the degree of global capital market integration.
The assumptions used have been derived from rigorous historical performance analysis combined with forward looking views of the financial markets as revealed through a the yield on long-term bonds and b the price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices.
The actuaries review analyses of historical risk and the correlation of the return on asset classes and apply subjective judgment based on their knowledge of the Groups plans.
The result of this analysis is incorporated into a risk matrix from which expected long-term risk premiums for each asset class are developed.
The nominal return expectations are determined by combining the asset class risk premiums with expected inflation and real risk-free rate assumptions.
As a final consideration, the nominal return assumptions are blended with current market conditions to develop long-term equilibrium expectations.
Year ended Year ended The actual return on plan assets was as follows: 1 January 31 December 2005 2005 United Kingdom 16.58% 8.04% United States of America 6.66% 11.61% Other countries 10.60% 12.24% The Group expects to contribute approximately 40 million to defined benefit pension plans in 2006.

BACKGROUND The Company operates a number of share-based compensation arrangements to provide incentives to the Groups senior management and other eligible employees.
Details of the schemes in respect of which options and awards are outstanding are set out in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 50 to 55.
SHARE OPTIONS Following a review by the Board in 2004, it was decided that the Companys executive share option schemes would not be renewed when they lapsed for the purposes of new grants in May 2005.
Accordingly, no new options were granted under these schemes during 2005.
Options will continue to be granted from time to time under the Companys savings-related share option scheme, which is restricted to employees who are resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom.
Options granted under the Companys share option schemes are classified as equity-settled awards.
The compensation expense recognised during the period in respect of share options was 3.9 million 2004 1.9 million.
Changes in the total number of share options outstanding during the period were as follows: Year ended 31 December 2005 Year ended 1 January 2005 Weighted Weighted average average Options exercise price Options exercise price Number Pence Number Pence Outstanding at the beginning of the period 30,333,766 236.49 25,273,442 234.30 Granted during the period 419,297 218.40 6,853,762 238.86 Forfeited during the period 1,197,190 214.80 1,143,977 219.60 Exercised during the period 175,884 239.96 627,524 191.33 Expired during the period 950,857 328.80 21,937 192.24 Outstanding at the end of the period 28,429,132 234.03 30,333,766 236.49 Exercisable at the end of the period 5,079,142 250.35 4,374,594 265.15 On the dates on which options were exercised during 2005, the weighted average market price of the Companys ordinary shares was 276.04p per share 2004 268.69p per share.
The compensation expense recognised in respect of share options is based on their fair value at the grant date calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Assumptions made in calculating the fair values of options granted during the period were as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 1 January 2005 2005 Options granted 419,297 6,853,762 Weighted average fair value 87.24p 70.18p Weighted average assumptions: Share price 273.00p 250.33p Exercise price 218.40p 239.05p Expected volatility 30.46% 31.50% Expected life 5.25 years 5.83 years Risk free interest rate 3.84% 4.51% Expected dividends 12.60p 12.00p Expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the market price of the Companys ordinary shares over the period since May 2001 when, following a period of significant fide-merger activity, the Group was re-focused on its remaining core businesses.
Adjustments have been made to the expected life used in the model to reflect the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The weighted average contractual life of share options outstanding at the end of the period was as follows: As at 31 December 2005 As at 1 January 2005 Weighted Weighted average average remaining remaining Outstanding contractual life Outstanding contractual life Number Years Number Years Range of exercise prices: 150p to 200p 6,165,914 5.78 6,264,914 6.74 201p to 250p 15,073,768 7.06 15,547,875 7.95 251p to 300p 6,171,222 7.49 6,171,222 8.49 301p and higher 1,018,228 6.10 1,970,728 3.73 28,429,132 29,954,739 TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005 GROUP IFRS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH IFRS 101 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 32.
SHARE-BASED INCENTIVES CONTINUED C. OTHER EQUITY-SETTLED AWARDS The Groups principal share-based compensation arrangement is the Annual Bonus Incentive Plan ABIP which is restricted to the Groups senior management and provides an award of bonus shares and deferred shares based on the profit of the business for which the participants have responsibility.
During the period, awards were made over 1,415,047 ordinary shares 2004 1,310,424 ordinary shares under the ABIP.
Also during the period, matching awards were made over 11,320 ordinary shares 2004 11,369 ordinary shares under the Share Matching Scheme SMS which is a legacy scheme that is closed to new entrants.
The fair value of awards made under these schemes is measured based on the market price of the Companys ordinary shares on the date of the award.
Where the awards do not attract dividends during the vesting period, the market price is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid during the expected life of the awards.
The weighted average fair value of awards made during the period was 257.08p 2004 252.14p.
Awards made under these schemes are classified as equity-settled awards.
The compensation expense recognised during the period was 3.5 million 2004 2.5 million.
D. CASH-SETTLED AWARDS The Deferred Matching Share Purchase Plan was introduced for James Nicol as part of the incentive package to attract him to the Company.
Under this plan 3,045,684 ordinary shares Matching Shares were awarded on 11 February 2002 following the purchase by Mr Nicol of 1,015,228 ordinary shares.
After three years from 18 February 2002 or earlier in certain circumstances, the award was to vest in respect of 1,015,228 Matching Shares and the remaining 2,030,456 Matching Shares were to vest to the extent that, for every 1 penny the highest market price of the Companys ordinary shares sustained over a five-day period during the six-month period ended 18 February 2005 exceeded 197 pence, being the market price on 18 February 2002, Mr Nicol was entitled to receive 5,153 shares.
In the event, the market price achieved under the terms of the plan was 285.25 pence and of the 2,030,456 Matching Shares, 454,752 vested and the balance lapsed.
Under the terms of his contract, Mr Nicol was entitled to elect to receive a cash payment in lieu of shares and for this reason this plan was classified as a cashsettled transaction.
In the event, Mr Nicol elected to receive cash and was paid 4,193,000 subject to statutory deductions in settlement on 28 February 2005.

ACQUISITIONS INDUSTRIAL & AUTOMOTIVE On 18 March 2005, the Group acquired L. E. Technologies, a recreational vehicle frame manufacturer, for cash consideration, including costs, of $80.0 million 41.8 million.
Goodwill of 26.4 million arising on the acquisition was capitalised which reflects that the acquisition provides the Group with an extended product range, enables Dexter Axle Company Inc. to pre-integrate its axles to vehicle frames and gives the opportunity for a number of synergies.
In addition to goodwill, an intangible asset of 2.4 million has been recognised for customer relationships.
On 1 July 2005, the Group acquired Eifeler Maschinenbau GmbH EMB, a manufacturer of high-performance hydraulic tube fittings, adapters and accessories, for cash consideration, including costs, of 36.5 million 24.6 million.
Provisional Goodwill of 11.1 million arising on the acquisition was capitalised which is attributable to the value of EMBs assembled workforce and its well established distribution network within Europe and Asia.
In addition, there is opportunity for significant synergies from the sale of the Groups existing products through EMBs distribution network and from the ability to offer a broader range of product to the Groups existing customer base.
During 2005, additional goodwill of 0.8 million was recognised on the acquisition of certain businesses of Mectrol Corporation in December 2004.
BUILDING PRODUCTS On 27 January 2005, the Group acquired Milcor Inc, a multi-brand manufacturer of building products, for cash consideration, including costs, of $42.9 million 22.8 million.
Goodwill of 14.1 million arising on the acquisition was capitalised which reflects the value of the enhancement of the Groups position in the residential grilles, registers and diffusers market as a result of the acquisition, the strengthening of the Groups ability to secure sales representation in several key markets and the provision of growth opportunities in the commercial products portion of the market.
In addition, the acquisition provides immediate access to a Chinese manufacturing source and an opportunity for significant synergies.

ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED On 23 September 2005, the Group acquired NRG Industries Inc, a multi brand manufacturer of commercial building accessories, for cash consideration, including costs, of $25.1 million 14.1 million.
Provisional goodwill of 7.1 million arising on the acquisition was capitalised which reflects that the acquisition gave the Group access to fully developed products that could be marketed more broadly through Ruskin Company and Air Systems Components channels.
In addition, the acquisition increased our presence in significant markets as well as providing opportunity for a number of manufacturing synergies.
The businesses acquired during the period contributed 90.0 million to the Groups revenue and 10.4 million to the Groups profit for the period during the period between their respective dates of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
In the event that these companies had been acquired on 2 January 2005, it is estimated that they would have contributed 129.3 million to the Groups revenue for the period, but it is not practicable to estimate what their contribution to the Groups profit for the period would have been on this assumption because balance sheets of these companies as at 2 January 2005 prepared in accordance with IFRS are not available.
