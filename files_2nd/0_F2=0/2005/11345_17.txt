59 Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards.
The accounting policies have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of FRS 18.
The directors consider the following accounting policies to be relevant in relation to the Groups financial statements.
These have been applied consistently throughout the current period.
a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
As stated in the directors report on page 43, the financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
The directors have arrived at their decision based on consideration of the Groups net current liabilities in relation to the Groups detailed budget for 2005 06 and the business plan for the period to 31 March 2010. b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the period are included from the date of their acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries disposed of during the period are included to the date of their disposal.
Inter segment sales and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation.
Where, for commercial reasons, the accounting reference date of a subsidiary is a date other than that of the Company, management accounts made up to the Companys accounting reference date have been used.
In accordance with FRS 5 Reporting the Substance of Transactions, the accounts of two companies are consolidated as quasi-subsidiaries.
c Associated undertakings and joint ventures The Groups share of profits less losses of associated undertakings and joint ventures is included in the Consolidated profit and loss account and the Groups share of their net assets liabilities is included in the consolidated balance sheet.
Joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates and joint ventures is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy set out below.
d Intangible fixed assets Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings, businesses, associates and joint ventures, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised and written off on a straight line basis over its useful economic life up to a maximum of 20 years.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Other intangible fixed assets represent the right to receive income under the operating agreement with the Environment Agency in respect of the Kielder Water transfer scheme.
The value of this intangible asset has been capped so as not to create negative goodwill on acquisition, 23 May 2003.
The term of the operating agreement is in perpetuity and accordingly no amortisation is provided.
The value of this intangible is assessed for impairment on an annual basis, in accordance with FRS 11. e Turnover Turnover, which excludes value added tax, represents the income receivable in the ordinary course of business for goods and services provided.
f Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets, including assets in the course of construction, comprise infrastructure assets being mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams, sludge pipelines and sea outfalls and other assets including properties, overground plant and equipment : i Infrastructure assets Infrastructure assets comprise a network of physical overground and underground systems.
Expenditure on infrastructure assets relating to increases in capacity or enhancements to the network and on maintaining the operating capability of the network, in accordance with defined standards of service, is treated as additions which are included at cost.
Costs include internal and external costs to bring the asset into use.
The Section 19 quality programme addresses water discolouration problems caused by iron pipes, either through relining these pipes or replacing them where relining is not possible.
Overlap expenditure represents the extra cost of replacing pipes rather than relining them where their structural condition is insufficient to withstand the relining process.
Such expenditure is classified as capital in nature and is included under infrastructure assets in the fixed asset note.
The depreciation charge for infrastructure assets is the estimated average amount of expenditure required to maintain the operating capability of the network, which is based on independently certified asset management plans, adjusted to reflect differences between estimated and actual expenditure over each five year regulatory period.
ii Other assets Other assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other assets are depreciated evenly over their estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows: freehold buildings, 30-60 years: short leasehold land and buildings, 25 years or lease term if shorter: operational structures, plant and machinery, 4-92 years: fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment, 4-10 years.
Where the remaining useful economic life of the asset Northumbrian Water Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2004 05 60 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued is estimated to be greater than 50 years, an impairment review is performed at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the carrying amount can be supported.
iii Assets in the course of construction Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
g Grants and contributions Revenue grants are credited to the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate.
Capital grants and contributions relating to tangible fixed assets are treated as deferred income and amortised in the profit and loss account over the expected useful economic lives of the qualifying assets.
Specifically, in the case of infrastructure assets, the expected useful economic lives have been determined by reference to the physical replacement cycle of those assets.
h Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are stated at their purchase cost, less any provision for impairment.
i Hire purchase and leasing Where assets are financed by hire purchase or leasing arrangements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and the corresponding capital cost is treated as a liability.
Rentals or leasing payments are treated as consisting of a capital element and finance costs, the capital element reducing the outstanding liability and the finance costs being written off to the profit and loss account over the period of the hire purchase contract or lease in proportion to the reducing outstanding liability.
Rental costs arising under operating leases are expensed in the period they are incurred.
j Stocks Stores are stated at cost less any provisions necessary to recognise damage and obsolescence.
Work in progress and finished goods are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes labour, materials, transport and an element of overheads.
k Long term contracts Profit on long term contracts is taken as the work is carried out if the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
The profit included is calculated on a prudent basis to reflect the proportion of the work carried out at the year end, by recording turnover and related costs as defined in Stocks above as contract activity progresses.
Turnover is calculated as that proportion of total contract value which costs incurred to date bear to total expected costs for that contract.
Revenues derived from variations on contracts are recognised only when they have been accepted by the customer.
Full provision is made for losses on all contracts in the year in which they are first foreseen.
l Pension costs The cost of providing pension benefits is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the expected average service lives of employees.
Differences between the amounts funded and amounts charged to the profit and loss account are treated as prepayments or provisions in the balance sheet.
Pension surpluses deficits arising on acquisition are recognised as an asset liability on the balance sheet, in accordance with FRS 7. m Taxation The charge for corporation tax is based on the profit for the period as adjusted for taxation purposes using the rates of tax enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provision is made for deferred tax in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less tax in future periods.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
As permitted by FRS 19, the Group has decided to adopt a policy of discounting deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the time value of money over the period between the balance sheet date and the dates on which it is estimated that the underlying timing differences will reverse.
The discount rates used reflect the post-tax yields to maturity that can be obtained at the balance sheet date on UK Government bonds with similar maturity dates to those of the deferred tax assets or liabilities.
n Research and development Research and development expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which it is incurred.
o Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial period and the results of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange for the period.
Differences on exchange arising from the re-translation of the opening net investment in subsidiary and associates companies, and from the translation of the results of those companies at average rate, are taken to reserves.
All other foreign exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account in the period in which they arise.
61 1 Accounting policies continued p Derivative financial instruments The Group utilises interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and forward exchange contracts as derivative financial instruments.
A derivative instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the risk profile of an underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Interest rate swap agreements are used to manage interest rate exposures.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of these derivatives are recognised over the period of the contracts as adjustments to net interest payable in the profit and loss account.
Forward exchange contracts are valued at the period end rates of exchange.
Resultant gains and losses are offset against foreign exchange gains or losses on the related borrowings or, where the instrument is used to hedge a committed future transaction, are deferred until the transaction occurs.
When interest rate swaps and underlying debt are terminated together, the net gain or loss is taken to the profit and loss account as interest payable.
When interest rate swaps are terminated but the underlying debt is retained then the gain loss is deferred and is amortised to interest payable over the remaining life of the underlying debt.
q Liquid resources Liquid resources comprise external deposits.
r Share-based compensation arrangements In accordance with UITF 17 employee share schemes, the costs of long term incentive awards to executive directors and senior managers in accordance with the Companys long term incentive plan see the directors remuneration report are expensed on a straight line basis over the period in which performance is measured.
The amount to be expensed is based upon an estimate of the probability that the performance criteria will be met.
In accordance with UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts, until such time as the Companys own shares held by the trust vest unconditionally in employees, the consideration paid for the shares will be deducted from shareholders funds.
s Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
Finance costs including issue costs are taken to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance costs and reduced by payments made in respect of the accounting period.
Debt acquired at acquisition is restated to its fair value.
The adjustment arising on acquisition is amortised to the profit and loss account on the basis of the maturity profile of each instrument.

19 Derivatives and financial instruments a Group strategy The level of capital expenditure which the Group is obliged to incur is such that it cannot be wholly financed by internally generated sources.
As a result, the Group must rely upon raising additional finance on a regular basis, to be principally used to fund the long term assets required in its regulated business.
The Groups strategy is to finance such investment by raising medium to long term debt, to provide a balance sheet match with long term assets and to fix a major proportion of interest rates.
b Treasury operations The main purpose of the Groups treasury function is to assess the Groups ongoing capital requirement and to raise funding on a timely basis, taking advantage of any favourable market opportunities.
It also invests any surplus funds the Group may have, based upon its forecast requirements and in accordance with the Groups treasury policy.
On occasions, derivatives are used as part of this process, but the Groups policies prohibit their use for speculation.
c Risks arising from the Groups financial instruments The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
All treasury activities are conducted in accordance with these policies.
d Liquidity risk As regards day to day liquidity, the Groups policy is to have available standby committed bank borrowing facilities with a value of no less than 50.0 million and with a bank agreement availability period of no less than three months.
At 31 March 2005, the Group had 90.0 million available in standby commited bank facilities.
Northumbrian Water Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2004 05 70 Notes to the financial statements continued 19 Derivatives and financial instruments continued e Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
It borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and accordingly uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The Groups policy is to keep a minimum 60% of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest.
At 31 March 2005, 88% 2004: 78% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates of interest.
f Foreign currency risk The Groups policy is that any foreign currency exposure in excess of 100,000 sterling equivalent of a transactional nature or 3.0 million sterling equivalent of a translation nature, should be covered immediately on identification.
g Market price risk The Groups exposure to market price risk principally comprises interest rate exposures.
The Groups policy is to accept a degree of interest rate risk.
On the basis of the Groups analysis, it is estimated that a 1% rise in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Groups pre-tax profits.
h Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and financial liabilities The interest rates and currency profile of the Groups net debt at 31 March 2005 were: Fixed rate net borrowings Weighted average Variable Weighted period for Total net rate net average which rate borrowings borrowings Borrowings interest rate is fixed m m m % Years Sterling borrowings: Loans principal 329.3 million 344.3 153.1 191.2 6.39 10.6 Eurobonds principal 1,499.2 million 1,555.3 1,555.3 6.49 19.4 Debentures principal 9.2 million 9.2 9.2 8.67 4.3 Finance leases principal 61.8 million 62.0 54.3 7.7 7.82 4.4 Overdrafts 32.8 32.8 2,003.6 240.2 1,763.4 6.50 18.3 Cash and short term deposits 118.0 118.0 Sterling loans receivable 4.6 4.6 Net debt at 31 March 2005 1,881.0 117.6 1,763.4 The difference between the principal value of 1,899.5 million and the carrying value of 1,970.8 million are unamortised issue costs of 15.7 million and a credit of 87.0 million in excess of the original loan proceeds to reflect the fair value of loans owed by subsidiaries acquired in 2003.
