Prior to 31 March 2000, the diluted net assets were arrived at on the assumption that all convertible stock was converted at the balance sheet date.
The total return per share is the fully diluted return per share, based on the total returns after tax and the weighted average fully diluted number of ordinary shares in issue during each period.
Where the fully diluted return per share exceeded the undiluted return per share the latter figure has been shown in accordance with standard accounting practice.
The Company commenced its business as an approved investment trust on 3 August 1988, following the listing of its share capital on the London Stock Exchange.
The figures for the year ended 31 March 2004 have been restated following the adoption of FRS17, Retirement Benefits.
