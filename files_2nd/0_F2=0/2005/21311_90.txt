Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31st December 2005 42 Contingent liabilities and commitments Contingent liabilities and commitments In common with other banks, the Group conducts business involving acceptances, performance bonds and indemnities.
The majority of these facilities are offset by corresponding obligations of third parties.
In addition, there are other derivative financial instruments, including swaps, futures, forwards and option contracts or combinations thereof all commonly known as derivatives, the nominal amounts of which are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet.
Nature of instruments An acceptance is an undertaking by a bank to pay a bill of exchange drawn on a customer.
The Group expects most acceptances to be presented, but reimbursement by the customer is normally immediate.
Endorsements are residual liabilities of the Group in respect of bills of exchange, which have been paid and subsequently rediscounted.
Assets are pledged as collateral for security to support the performance of a customer to third parties.
As the Group will only be required to meet these obligations in the event of the customers default, the cash requirements of these instruments are expected to be considerably below their nominal amounts.
Other contingent liabilities include transaction related customs and performance bonds and are, generally, short-term commitments to third parties which are not directly dependent on the customers creditworthiness.
Commitments to lend are agreements to lend to a customer in the future, subject to certain conditions.
Such commitments are either made for a fixed period, or have no specific maturity but are cancellable by the lender subject to notice requirements.
Documentary credits commit the Group to make payments to third parties, on production of documents, which are usually reimbursed immediately by customers.
The following tables summarise the nominal principal amount of contingent liabilities and commitments with off-balance sheet risk.
