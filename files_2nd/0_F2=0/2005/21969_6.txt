Changes in accounting policy and presentation During the 2005 financial year the group adopted UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts and the related amendments to UITF Abstract 17 revised 2003 Employee Share Schemes.
UITF38 changes the presentation of an entitys own shares held in an ESOP trust from previously being held as assets to being deducted in arriving at shareholders funds.
UITF17 revised 2003 requires the amounts recognised in the profit and loss account in respect of share awards from previously being based on the book value of shares held in the ESOP trusts to being based on the fair value of shares at the date the award is made.
An additional charge of 3 million and a credit of 4 million for the 2004 and 2003 financial years, respectively has been made to the group profit and loss account.
The effect on the groups balance sheet at 31 March 2004 has been to increase xed assets by 1 million.
Had we not adopted this change the charge to the profit and loss account would have been 8 million higher in the 2005 financial year.
A small number of changes in the presentation of the notes to the financial statements have been made and comparative gures have been restated accordingly as explained in the notes where material.

In the period from 1 April 2004 to 24 February 2005 Infonet generated operating losses after tax of US$83 million year to 31 March 2004 US$66 million losses.
b In December 2004 the group agreed to acquire the 74% interest in Albacom SpA not already held, giving BT full ownership for total consideration of 131 million, including deferred consideration of 38 million.
The deferred consideration is dependent upon the financial performance of Albacom in the 2009 financial year and the minimum payable is 38 million.
This gave rise to goodwill of 9 million.
44 British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 14.
Acquisitions and disposals continued Prior to becoming a subsidiary undertaking, Albacom SpA was accounted for as a joint venture undertaking.
In accordance with FRS 2 Accounting for Subsidiary Undertakings, and in order to give a true and fair view, purchased goodwill has been calculated as the sum of the goodwill arising on each purchase of shares in Albacom, being the difference at the date of each purchase between the fair value of the consideration given and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to the interest purchased.
This represents a departure from the statutory method, under which goodwill is calculated as the difference between cost and fair value on the date that Albacom became a subsidiary undertaking.
The statutory method would not give a true and fair view because it would result in the groups share of Albacoms retained reserves, during the period that it was a joint venture undertaking, being recharacterised as goodwill.
The effect of this departure is to reduce retained profits by 313 million, and to reduce purchased goodwill by 313 million.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Albacom is being amortised over 20 years.
In the period from 1 April 2004 to 3 February 2005 Albacom generated operating losses after tax of E195 million year to 31 March 2004 E263 million losses.

The groups share of the net assets acquired was 2 million, giving rise to goodwill of 13 million which is being amortised over a period of 13 years.
On 13 January 2004 the group took full control of Siosistemi SpA for consideration of 4 million including deferred consideration of 1 million.
Net assets of 1 million were acquired giving rise to goodwill of 4 million which is being amortised over a period of 10 years.

As part of the settlement with AT&T for the unwind of the Concert global venture BT received net cash of US$72 million 56 million.
This net settlement included the receipt of US$350 million reflecting the allocation of the businesses and the payment of US$278 million to achieve the equal division of specified working capital and other liability balances.

At 31 March 2005, other than disclosed below, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the ordinary course of the groups business and on these no material losses are anticipated.
The group has insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by O2 UK Limited prior to its demerger with O2 on 19 November 2001.
O2 plc has given BT a counterindemnity for these guarantees.
The maximum likely exposure is US$76 million 41 million as at 31 March 2005, although this could increase by a further US$563 million 298 million in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until O2 UK Ltd has discharged all its obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
The company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings which would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the group.
Proceedings have been initiated in Italy against 21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection with the Italian UMTS auction.
Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction process.
The hearings are continuing in Rome.
If the proceedings are successful, BT could be held liable, with others, for any damages.
The company has concluded that it is not appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such potential claim.
The European Commission is formally investigating the way the UK Government has set BTs property rates and those paid by Kingston Communications.
The Commission is examining whether the Government has complied with EC Treaty rules preventing on state aid in assessing BTs rates.
BTs rates were set by the Valuation Ofce after lengthy discussions based on well established principles, in a transparent process.
In BTs view, any allegation of state aid is groundless and BT is confident that the Government will demonstrate the fairness of the UK ratings system.
A nding against HM Government could result in BT having to repay any amount of state aid it may be determined to have received.
The company has concluded that it is not appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such potential nding.

Pension costs Background The group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
In addition, disclosures have been presented in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard No.
The group offers retirement plans to its employees.
The groups main scheme, the BT Pension Scheme BTPS, is a dened benefit scheme where the benets are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
The BTPS is funded through a legally separate trustee administered fund.
This scheme has been closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001 and replaced by a dened contribution scheme.
Under this dened contribution scheme the profit and loss charge represents the contribution paid by the group based upon a xed percentage of employees pay.
The total pension costs of the group expensed within staff costs in the year was 465 million 2004 404 million, 2003 322 million, of which 430 million 2004 376 million, 2003 306 million related to the groups main dened benefit pension scheme, the BTPS.
The increase in the pension cost in the 2005 financial year reects the introduction of Smart Pensions, a National Insurance salary sacrifice scheme under which employees elect to stop making employee contributions and for the company to make additional contributions in return for a reduction in gross contractual pay.
As a result there has been a switch between wages and salaries and pension costs of 99 million in the year.
The increase in the pension cost in the 2004 financial year reects the amortisation charge for the pension deficit partly offset by a reduction in the number of active members of the BTPS and the interest credit relating to the balance sheet prepayment.
This total pension cost includes the cost of providing enhanced pension benets to leavers, which amounted to nil million 2004 1 million, 2003 60 million.
The pension cost applicable to the groups main dened contribution schemes in the year ended 31 March 2005 was 11 million 2004 7 million, 2003 4 million, and 1.2 million 2004 0.7 million, 2003 0.4 million of contributions to the schemes were outstanding at 31 March 2005.
The group occupies four properties owned by the scheme on which an annual rental of 7 million is payable.
The BTPS assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, UK and overseas properties, xed interest and index linked securities, deposits and short-term investments.
At 31 March 2005, the UK equities included 17 million 2004 33 million, 2003 37 million ordinary shares of BT Group plc with a market value of 36 million 2004 58 million, 2003 58 million.
BT Pension Scheme Funding valuation A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent scheme trustees by a professionally qualied independent actuary, using the projected unit method.
The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.
The triennial valuation as at 31 December 2002 forms the basis of determining the groups pension fund contributions for the year ending 31 March 2004 and future periods until the next valuation is completed.
The funding valuation is performed at 31 December because this is the financial year end of the BTPS.
The valuation basis for funding purposes is broadly as follows: & scheme assets are valued at market value at the valuation date: and & scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the estimated rate of return reecting the assets of the scheme.
The last three triennial valuations were determined using the following long-term assumptions: Real rates per annum Nominal rates per annum 2002 1999 1996 2002 1999 1996 valuation valuation valuation valuation valuation valuation % % % % % % Return on existing assets, relative to market values 4.52 2.38 3.80 7.13 5.45 7.95 after allowing for an annual increase in dividends of 1.00 1.00 0.75 3.53 4.03 4.78 Return on future investments 4.00 4.00 4.25 6.60 7.12 8.42 Average increase in retail price index 2.50 3.00 4.00 Average future increases in wages and salaries 1.50 1.75 1.75 4.04 4.80 5.82 Average increase in pensions 2.50 3.00 3.75-4.00 There is a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 1.25% for the first three years.
British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 59 28.
Pension costs continued The mortality assumption reects improvements in life expectancy since the 1999 valuation and incorporates further future improvements.
The assumed rate of investment return, salary increases and mortality all have a significant effect on the funding valuation.
A 0.25 percentage point change in these assumptions would have the following effects: Impact on funding deficit Increase Decrease bn bn 0.25 percentage point change in: Investment return 0.9 0.9 Wage and salary increases 0.2 0.2 An additional year of life expectancy would result in a 0.7 billion increase in the deficit.
At 31 December 2002, the assets of the BTPS had a market value of 22.8 billion 1999 29.7 billion and were sufficient to cover 91.6% 1999 96.8% of the benets accrued by that date, after allowing for expected future increases in wages and salaries but not taking into account the costs of providing incremental pension benets for employees leaving under release schemes since that date.
This represents a funding deficit of 2.1 billion compared to 1.0 billion at 31 December 1999.
The funding valuation uses conservative assumptions whereas, had the valuation been based on the actuarys view of the median estimate basis, the funding deficit would have been reduced to 0.4 billion.
Although the current market value of equity investments has fallen, the investment income and contributions received by the scheme exceeded the benets paid by 0.3 billion in the year ended 31 December 2002.
As a result of the triennial funding valuation the group has agreed to make employers contributions at a rate of 12.2% of pensionable pay from April 2003 and annual deficiency payments of 232 million.
This compared to the employers contribution rate of 11.6% and annual deficiency payments of 200 million that were determined under the 1999 funding valuation.
In the year ended 31 March 2005, the group made regular contributions of 376 million 2004 284 million, 2003 278 million and additional special contributions for enhanced pension benets to leavers in the year ended 31 December 2003 of 6 million in the 2004 financial year 2004 130 million, 2003 129 million and deficiency contributions of nil 2004 612 million, 2003 200 million as a result of the early payment of 380 million made in the 2004 financial year that was scheduled for payment in subsequent years.
Under the terms of the trust deed that governs the BTPS the group is required to have a funding plan that should address the deficit over a maximum period of 20 years whilst the agreed funding plan addresses the deficit over a period of 15 years.
The group will continue to make deficiency payments until the deficit is made good.
The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001 and the age prole of active members will consequently increase.
Under the projected unit method, the current service cost, as a proportion of the active members pensionable salaries, is expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Despite the scheme being closed to new entrants, the projected payment prole extends over more than 60 years.
SSAP 24 accounting valuation The SSAP 24 valuation is broadly on the following basis: & scheme assets are valued at market value: and & scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the estimated rate of return reecting the assets of the scheme.
The pension cost for the 2003 financial year was based on the SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2000.
At 31 March 2000 there was a SSAP 24 deficit of 0.2 billion and the regular cost for the 2003 and 2002 financial years was 11.6% of pensionable salaries.
The SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2000 was based on the same assumptions as the December 1999 funding valuation, with the exception that, over the long-term, it has been assumed that the return on the existing assets of the scheme, relative to market values, would be a nominal 5.6% per annum which equates to a real return of 2.5% per annum.
The pension cost for the 2005 and 2004 financial years were based upon the SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2003.
At 31 March 2003, there was a SSAP 24 deficit of 1.4 billion, before taking account of the balance sheet prepayment and the regular cost is 11.3% of pensionable salaries.
The SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2003 is based on the 31 December 2002 funding valuation rolled forward, and uses the same assumptions as set out above, with the following exceptions: & return on existing assets is assumed to be a nominal 7.1% per annum, which equates to a real return of 4.7%: & average increase in retail price index is assumed to be 2.25% per annum: and & the average future increases in wages and salaries is assumed to include a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 0.75% for the first three years, before returning to 1.5%.
60 British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 28.
Pension costs continued The cumulative difference since the adoption of SSAP 24 between the cash contributions paid by the group to the pension scheme and the profit and loss charge is reected on the balance sheet.
The cumulative cash contributions exceed the profit and loss charge and the resulting difference is shown as a prepayment on the balance sheet.
At 31 March 2005 the prepayment was 1,118 million 2004 1,172 million.
The pension charge to the profit and loss account will also include the amortisation of the combined pension fund position and pension prepayment over the average remaining service lives of scheme members, which amounts to 13 years, and the cost of enhanced pension benets provided to leavers.
FRS 17 Retirement benets The group continues to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
Full implementation of FRS 17 has been deferred by the Accounting Standards Board and would have applied to the group for the 2006 financial year.
However, in the 2006 financial year the group will adopt International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The requirements for disclosure under FRS 17 remain in force between its issue and full implementation, and the required information is set out below.
FRS 17 species how key assumptions should be derived and applied.
These assumptions are often different to the assumptions adopted by the pension scheme actuary and trustees in determining the funding position of pension schemes.
The accounting requirements under FRS 17 are broadly as follows: & scheme assets are valued at market value at the balance sheet date: & scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability: and & movement in the scheme surplus deficit is split between operating charges and nancing items in the profit and loss account and, in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, actuarial gains and losses.
The financial assumptions used to calculate the BTPS liabilities under FRS 17 at 31 March 2005 are: Real rates per annum Nominal rates per annum 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 % % % % % % Average future increases in wages and salaries 1.00 1.00 1.50 3.73 3.63 3.78 Average increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.70 2.60 2.25 Rate used to discount scheme liabilities 2.63 2.63 3.08 5.40 5.50 5.40 Ination average increase in retail price index 2.70 2.60 2.25 There is a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 0.75% for the first year 2004 two years, 2003 three years.
The expected nominal rate of return and fair values of the assets of the BTPS at 31 March were: 31 March 2005 31 March 2004 31 March 2003 Expected Expected Expected long-term long-term long-term rate of rate of rate of return return return per annum Asset fair value per annum Asset fair value per annum Asset fair value %b % %b % %b % UK equities 8.0 9.6 32 8.2 9.2 34 8.2 7.4 34 Non-UK equities 8.0 9.0 30 8.2 8.1 30 8.2 6.4 30 Fixed-interest securities 5.4 4.6 16 5.3 4.0 15 5.2 3.1 14 Index-linked securities 4.4 2.8 10 4.4 2.3 9 4.3 1.7 8 Property 6.8 3.6 12 6.8 3.3 12 7.0 3.3 15 Cash and other 4.0 4.0 4.0 0.4 1 Total 7.1 29.6 100 7.3 26.9 100 7.4 21.5 100 The long-term expected rate of return on investments does not affect the level of the deficit but does affect the level of the expected return on assets within the net finance cost charged to the profit and loss account under FRS 17.

Pension costs continued The net pension deficit set out below is under FRS 17 is as if this standard was fully applied.
The fair value of the BTPS assets, the present value of the BTPS liabilities based on the financial assumptions set out above, and the resulting deficit, together with those of unfunded pension liabilities at 31 March 2005 and 31 March 2004 are shown below.
The fair value of the BTPS assets is not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before it is realised.
The present value of the liabilities is derived from long-term cash ow projections and is thus inherently uncertain.

Directors emoluments and pensions For the year ended 31 March 2005 the aggregate emoluments of the directors was 3,276,000 2004 3,834,500.
This includes deferred bonuses of 457,000 2004 646,500 which have been awarded and are payable in 5p ordinary shares of BT Group plc in three years time.
Retirement benets were accruing to three directors 2004 one under a dened benets pension scheme.
During the year no director exercised options 2004 nil under BT Group share option plans.
Five directors 2004 three received or are entitled to receive 5p ordinary shares of BT Group plc under BT long-term incentive plans.
The aggregate value of BT Group plc shares vested in directors during the year under BT long-term incentive plans was 2,142,000.
The emoluments of the highest paid director were 1,736,000 2004 2,397,500.
He is entitled to receive 4,690,280 BT Group plc 5p ordinary shares under BT long-term incentive plans.

Financial instruments and risk management The group holds or issues financial instruments mainly to finance its operations: for the temporary investment of shortterm funds: and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments for example trade debtors and trade creditors arise directly from the groups operations.
The group nances its operations primarily by a mixture of issued share capital, retained profits, deferred taxation, long-term loans and short-term loans, principally by issuing commercial paper and medium-term notes.
The group borrows in the major long-term debt markets in major currencies.
Typically, but not exclusively, the bond markets provide the most cost-effective means of long-term borrowing.
The group uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its exposure to market risks from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.
The derivatives used for this purpose are principally interest rate swaps, gilt locks, currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The types of financial instrument used for investment of short-term funds are prescribed in group treasury policies with limits on the exposure to any one organisation.
Short-term investing in financial instruments is undertaken on behalf of the group by substantial external fund managers who are limited to dealing in debt instruments and certain dened derivative instruments and are given strict guidelines on credit, diversication and maturity proles.
During the year ended 31 March 2005, the groups net debt reduced from 8.5 billion to 7.9 billion mainly from working capital inows and proceeds from the sale of investments.
During the 2005 financial year, the group restructured some of its swaps portfolio.
As a result, the group terminated 2.9 billion of cross-currency and sterling interest rate swaps with some swaps being replaced with new swaps which had the same economic hedging effect.
This resulted in the group paying 107 million in reducing gross debt and receiving a net 14 million of interest receipts.
The interest receipts and payments on restructuring have been included within deferred income and other debtors respectively and will be amortised to the profit and loss account over the term of the underlying hedged debt.
The groups xed:oating interest rate prole on net debt is 95:5 at 31 March 2005.
During the year ended 31 March 2004 the groups net debt reduced from 9.6 billion to 8.5 billion due to working capital inows.
During the 2004 financial year, the group restructured some of its swaps portfolio to mitigate credit risk to certain counter parties.
As a result, the group terminated 7 billion of cross-currency interest rate swaps and replaced these with new swaps which had the same economic hedging effect.
This resulted in the group paying 445 million in reducing gross debt and receiving 420 million of interest.
The interest receipt has been included in deferred income and will be amortised to the profit and loss account over the term of the underlying debt.
The groups xed:oating interest rate prole on net debt was 76:24 at 31 March 2004.
During the year ended 31 March 2003, the groups net debt reduced from 13.7 billion to 9.6 billion.
2.6 billion was realised from the disposal of the groups interest in Cegetel Groupe SA in the year, and the group has closed out 2.6 billion of associated xed interest rate swaps.
The groups xed:oating interest rate prole on net debt therefore remained at 88:12 at 31 March 2003.
The group uses financial instruments to hedge some of its currency exposures arising from its non-UK assets, liabilities and forward purchase commitments.
The group also hedges some of its interest liabilities.
The financial instruments used comprise borrowings in foreign currencies, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, gilt locks and interest and currency swaps.
There has been no change in the nature of the groups risk prole between 31 March 2005 and the date of these financial statements.
The notional amounts of derivatives summarised below do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not necessarily a measure of the exposure of the group through its use of derivatives.
The amounts exchanged are calculated on the notional amounts and other terms of the derivatives which relate to interest and exchange rates.
British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 65 32.
Financial instruments and risk management continued a Interest rate risk management The group has entered into interest rate swap agreements with banks and other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are xed.
Under interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the differences between xed rate and oating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
Under gilt locks, forward sales of UK government long-dated treasury stock were entered into for periods of up to one year.
This hedge effectively xed in the interest on part of the groups then future borrowings, all of which have now been taken on.
At 31 March 2005, the group had outstanding interest rate swap agreements having a total notional principal amount of 5,297 million 2004 5,210 million.
b Foreign exchange risk management Cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts have been entered into to reduce the foreign currency exposure on the groups operations and the groups net assets.
The group also enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge investments, interest expense and purchase and sale commitments denominated in foreign currencies principally US dollars and the euro.
The remaining terms of the currency swaps are up to 26 years and the terms of currency forward exchange contracts are typically less than one year.
The purpose of the groups foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that the eventual net inows and net outows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
At 31 March 2005, the group had outstanding foreign currency swap agreements and forward exchange contracts having a total notional principal amount of 9,819 million 2004 11,367 million.
The values of forward foreign currency contracts at 31 March 2005 were 427 million 2004 301 million for purchases of currency and 782 million 2004 1,223 million for sales of currency.
These values have been estimated by calculating their present values using the market discount rates, appropriate to the terms of the contracts, in effect at the balance sheet dates.
At 31 March 2005, the group had deferred unrealised gains of 2 million 2004 nil million and losses of nil million 2004 5 million, based on dealer-quoted prices, from hedging purchase and sale commitments, and in addition had deferred realised net losses of 5 million 2004 3 million gains.
These are included in the profit and loss account as part of the hedged purchase or sale transaction when it is recognised, or as gains or losses when a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur.
c Concentrations of credit risk and credit exposures of financial instruments The group considers that it is not exposed to major concentrations of credit risk.
The group, however, is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
The group limits the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty.
The group does not normally see the need to seek collateral or other security.
The long-term debt instruments issued in December 2000 and February 2001 both contained covenants that if the group credit rating was downgraded below A3 in the case of Moodys or below A minus in the case of S&P, additional interest would accrue from the next interest coupon period at the rate of 0.25 percentage points for each ratings category adjustment by each ratings agency.
In May 2001, Moodys downgraded BTs credit rating to Baa1, which increased BTs interest charge by approximately 32 million per annum.
BTs current rating from S&P is A minus.
Based upon the total debt of 9 billion outstanding on these instruments at 31 March 2005, BTs annual interest charge would increase by approximately 26 million if BTs credit rating were to be downgraded by one credit rating category by both agencies below a long-term debt rating of Baa1 A minus.
If BTs credit rating with Moodys was to be upgraded by one credit rating category the annual interest charge would be reduced by approximately 13 million.

Financial instruments and risk management continued d Fair value of financial instruments The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of the groups financial instruments at 31 March 2005 and 2004.
The carrying amounts are included in the group balance sheet under the indicated headings, with the exception of derivative amounts, which are included in debtors or other creditors or as part of net debt as appropriate.
The fair values of the financial instruments are the amount at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in forced or liquidation sale.

The carrying amount of the other short-term deposits and investments approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the instruments held.
b The fair values of listed fixed asset investments were estimated based on quoted market prices for those investments.
c The fair value of the groups bonds, debentures, notes and other long-term borrowings has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with the same maturities where they existed, and on calculations of the present value of future cash flows using the appropriate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, where market prices of similar issues did not exist.
d The fair value of the groups outstanding foreign currency and interest rate swap agreements was estimated by calculating the present value, using appropriate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, of affected future cash flows translated, where appropriate, into pounds sterling atthe market rates in effect at the balance sheet dates.

Financial instruments and risk management continued The amounts shown in the table above take into account the effect of any currency swaps, forward contracts and other derivatives entered into to manage those currency exposures.
At 31 March 2005, the group also held various forward currency contracts that the group had taken out to hedge expected future foreign currency purchases and sales.

These lines of credit are available for up to one year.
Post balance sheet events In March 2005 BT agreed to acquire Radianz, the leading financial services extranet provider, from Reuters for consideration of 107 million for the business plus any cash remaining on the balance sheet, net of working capital adjustments, at completion date.
Regulatory clearance was received in April and the transaction completed on 29 April 2005.
