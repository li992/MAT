Save for Shares Plans Since 1994 the Group has operated a Save-As-You-Earn plan for UK employees.
In 1998, the Group introduced a Worldwide Save for Shares Plan.
Under these plans, employees can save a portion of their monthly salary over periods of three, five or seven years.
At the end of this period, the employee has the option to purchase ordinary shares with the accumulated funds at a purchase price equal to 80% of the market price prevailing at the time of the commencement of the employees participation in the plan.
Options that are not exercised within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary after grant lapse unconditionally.
PEARSON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2005 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 24 Employee benets continued Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2000, the Group established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows all employees in the United States to save a portion of their monthly salary over six month periods.
At the end of the period the employee has the option to purchase ADRs with their accumulated funds at a purchase price equal to 85% of the lower of the market price prevailing at the beginning or end of the period.
Executive Share Option Plan Under this plan, options were granted to senior management at an exercise price equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant.
Options granted prior to 1996 are not subject to performance conditions.
The exercise of options granted since 1996 is subject to growth in the Groups adjusted earnings per share over a three year period prior to exercise.
Options become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant and lapse if they remain unexercised at the tenth.
No new awards will be made under this plan.
Reward Plan Awards of premium priced options were made under this plan in 1999 and 2000 with an exercise price above the market value of the shares at the grant date.
The exercise of options is subject to Pearsons share price remaining above certain thresholds for specified periods of time and to growth in the Groups adjusted earnings per share over the three year period prior to exercise.
Options became exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant and lapse if they remain unexercised at the tenth.
Special Share Option Plan In 2000, the Group made a special one-off award of share options with an exercise price equal to the market price of the shares on the grant date.
They vested in tranches of 50% on the first anniversary of the date of grant and 25% on the second and third anniversaries of the grant date.
Options lapse if they remain unexercised at the tenth anniversary of the grant date.
Long-Term Incentive Plan This plan was introduced in 2001 and consists of two parts: share options and or restricted shares.
Options were granted under this plan in 2001 based on a pre-grant earnings per share growth test and are not subject to further performance conditions on exercise.
The options became exercisable in tranches and lapse if they remain unexercised at the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
PEARSON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2005 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 24 Employee benets continued The vesting of restricted shares is normally dependent upon the satisfaction of corporate performance targets over a three year period.
These targets may be based on market and or non-market performance criteria.
Restricted shares granted in 2001 vested based on Pearsons three-year cumulative free cash ow per share performance.
Awards made in December 2002 and September 2003 vest in tranches.
One sixth of the award vests after three years with no performance conditions.
The vesting of the balance depends on Pearsons share price performance over the seven year period following the grants.
Restricted shares awarded in December 2004 and September 2005 vest dependent on the following market and non-market performance criteria: relative shareholder return, return on invested capital and a combination of earnings per share and sales growth.
The award is split equally across all three measures.
Annual Bonus Share Matching Plan This plan permits executive directors and senior executives around the Group to invest up to 50% of any after tax annual bonus in Pearson shares.
If these shares are held and the Group meets an earnings per share growth target, the Company will match them on a gross basis of up to one share for every one held after three years and another one for two originally held after five years.
The number and weighted average exercise prices of share options granted under the Groups schemes are as follows: 2005 2004 2003 2005 Weighted 2004 Weighted 2003 Weighted Number of average Number of average Number of average share exercise share exercise share exercise options price options price options price 000s 000s 000s Outstanding at beginning of year 26,179 5.93 32,284 6.93 35,608 8.84 Granted during the year 606 5.06 886 4.56 2,309 5.16 Exercised during the year 324 6.78 254 10.10 89 10.60 Forfeited during the year 4,352 10.42 6,301 7.49 5,053 16.25 Expired during the year 432 436 491 Outstanding at end of year 21,677 5.05 26,179 5.93 32,284 6.93 Options exercisable at the end of year 7,634 7.80 9,071 9.23 9,882 9.44 Options were exercised regularly throughout the year.
The weighted average share price during the year was 6.52 2004: 6.25: 2003: 5.72.
Early exercises are treated as an acceleration of vesting and the remaining charge is recognised at the date of exercise.

The fair value of restricted shares that vest conditionally upon the fullment of a market condition were valued by an independent actuary using a Monte Carlo model.
Shares with a non-market vesting condition were fair valued based on the share price at the date of grant taking into account any future dividend payments.
The performance conditions were considered by adjusting the number of shares expected to vest based on the most likely outcome of the relevant performance criteria.
Subsidiary share option plans IDC, a 61% subsidiary of the Group, operates the following share-based payment plans: 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2001, IDC adopted the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for all eligible employees worldwide.
The 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows employees to purchase stock at a discounted price at specic times.
2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan Under this plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors can grant share-based awards representing up to 20% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding at the date of grant.
The plan provides for the discretionary issuance of share-base awards to directors, ofcers and employees of IDC, as well as persons who provide consulting or other services to IDC.
The exercise price for all options granted to date has been equal to the market price of the underlying shares at the date of grant.
Options expire ten years from the date of grant and generally vest over a three to four year period without any performance criteria attached.
PEARSON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2005 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 24 Employee benets continued In addition, grants of restricted stock can be made to certain executives and members of the Board of Directors of IDC.
