Goodwill amortisation Under UK GAAP, goodwill was amortised over its useful economic life, not exceeding 20 years.
Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortised but tested annually for impairment.
At 1 January 2004 and at 31 December 2004 under IFRS, all goodwill has been tested for impairment and no impairment was identified.
At 31 December 2004 under IFRS, goodwill amortisation of 75m expensed under UK GAAP has been reversed.
Intangible assets Under UK GAAP, computer software costs attributable to major business systems implementations were capitalised as property, plant and equipment.
Under IFRS, computer software costs attributable to major business systems implementations are capitalised as intangible assets.
Under UK GAAP, intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition were subsumed within goodwill.
Under IFRS, intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition are recognised separately when their fair values can be measured reliably.
Under UK GAAP, all expenditure on development activities was written off.
Under IFRS, expenditure on development activities that meet the criteria for capitalisation is recognised in intangible assets.
At 1 January 2004 under IFRS, computer software of 29m has been reclassified from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets, goodwill of 1m has been reclassified to intangible assets and intangible assets of 1m have been recognised as a result of development activities.
At 31 December 2004 under IFRS, computer software of 38m has been reclassified from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets, goodwill of 1m has been reclassified to intangible assets and intangible assets of 1m have been recognised as a result of development activities.
Share based payment Under UK GAAP, a provision was recognised for cash settled options based on intrinsic value at the balance sheet date.
Under IFRS, a provision is recognised for cash settled options based on the fair value of cash settled options at the balance sheet date calculated using appropriate pricing models.
At 1 January 2004 under IFRS, the provision for cash settled options increases by 1m.
At 31 December 2004 under IFRS, the provision for cash settled options increases by 2m.
Retirement benefit obligations Under UK GAAP, insured liabilities for lump sum death in service benefits were based on premiums payable.
Under IFRS, insured liabilities for lump sum death in service benefits are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet to the extent that they relate to past service.
Under UK GAAP, the fair value of pension plan assets was calculated using mid prices.
Under IFRS, the fair value of pension plan assets is calculated using bid prices.
At 1 January 2004 under IFRS, retirement benefit obligations increase by 12m relating to death in service benefits, by 1m relating to the valuation of assets at bid prices and by 4m for other adjustments.
At 31 December 2004 under IFRS, retirement benefit obligations increase by 14m relating to death in service benefits, by 2m relating to the valuation of assets at bid prices and by 3m for other adjustments.
Equity dividends Under UK GAAP, equity dividends were recognised in the period to which they related.
Under IFRS, final equity dividends are recognised only when approved by the shareholders and interim dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.
At 1 January 2004 under IFRS, the final dividend proposed in respect of 2003 of 52m is not recognised.
At 31 December 2004 under IFRS, the final dividend proposed in respect of 2004 of 55m is not recognised.
Cross currency swaps Under UK GAAP, borrowings hedged by cross currency swaps are recorded net of the spot value of the swaps and therefore effectively measured at the rates of exchange of the swap contracts.
Under IFRS, the spot value of the cross currency swaps is presented separately.
In order to be consistent with the presentation of derivative financial instruments in 2005 on adoption of IAS39, when the fair value of the cross currency swaps is recognised, the cross currency swaps are presented as derivative financial instruments.
At 1 January 2004 under IFRS, borrowings increase by 63m and a derivative financial instrument asset is recognised of 63m.
At 31 December 2004 under IFRS, borrowings increase by 101m and a derivative financial instrument asset is recognised of 101m.
