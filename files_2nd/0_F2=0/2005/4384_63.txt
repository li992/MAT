Prior Year Restatements The adoption of FRS 20, FRS 25 and FRS 26 has resulted in the restatement of prior periods as follows: FRS 20 The Dana Petroleum 1999 Share Option Scheme is an equity-settled share incentive scheme and under previous UK GAAP no adjustment was made to the financial statements when options were granted under this arrangement.
Two awards have been made under this scheme since 7 November 2002.
FRS 20 requires for such awards, that provision be made for any future share-based pay out and for this to be presented within equity.
Under FRS this is based on the fair value of all share-based awards at the grant date calculated using an option pricing model.
In addition, FRS 20 requires that provision also be made for the deferred corporation tax adjustment arising on the intrinsic value of the option awards at the reporting date, and for this also to be represented in equity until the current tax adjustment arises.
The net increase to equity of these adjustments at 31 December 2004 was Nil due to the fact that the deferred tax asset of 1,051,000 has not been recognised see note 42 on page 75.
FRS 25 and 26 Under previous UK GAAP, Group investments were included in the financial statements at cost less provision for diminution.
At 1 January 2005, Company investments comprise Dana Petroleums holding in Faroe Petroleum plc.
The Company has reviewed its financial assets and liabilities and in compliance with FRS 25 & 26 has reclassified these investments as available-for-sale financial assets and restated these in the financial statements at fair value.
At 1 January 2005 fair value for the investment in Faroe Petroleum plc was based on that companys share price on the London AIM market at that date.
At 1 January 2005, the effect of the adjustments was to increase equity by 2,045,000.
