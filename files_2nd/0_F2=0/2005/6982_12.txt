a Fair value adjustment on acquired inventory As required by IFRS 3 Business Combinations at the date of acquisition of American Cystoscope Makers Inc finished goods were valued at the selling price less the costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort.
Work in progress was valued at the selling price of the finished goods less costs to complete, costs of disposal and reasonable profit allowance for completing and selling the goods.
Raw materials were valued at current replacement cost.
The fair value adjustment arising as a result of this valuation exercise amounted to an increase in the value of inventories of 4,686,000.
The inventory uplift reversed through the income statement over the inventory turn and the charge arising in the year ended 31 December 2005 was 4,686,000. b Option accounting On 16 June 2005 Gyrus announced the proposed acquisition of ACMI for a total consideration of $497 million.
On the same date it entered a placing agreement to raise 116 million net.
In order to ensure that 116 million proceeds of the sterling capital raised would buy at least US$ 206 million required for settlement, regardless of movements in the US$:GBP exchange rate, Gyrus entered into an option agreement.
The cost of the option was 992,000 and the terms of the option allowed for exercise up to 15 August 2005.
On completion, the sale of the option generated proceeds of 2,972,000 a net gain of 1,980,000.
This has been deemed an ineffective hedge under the provisions of IAS 39, and therefore the cost of the option and the sale proceeds thereof have been taken to financial expenses and financial income respectively.
As fully explained in accounting policies section f, financial instrument accounting is determined on different bases in 2005 and 2004 due to the transitional provisions of IAS 32 and IAS 39.
