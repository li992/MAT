EEV SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION PARENT COMPANY ACCOUNTS Notes to the EEV results continued 7.
EEV assumptions 7.1 Principal economic assumptions deterministic Economic assumptions are actively reviewed and are based on the market yields on risk-free assets at the valuation date.
2005 2004 UK and International excluding Lombard : % % Risk-free rate i 4.1 4.6 Investment returns before tax: Fixed interest 3.8-4.7 4.15.2 Equities 7.1 7.6 Properties 6.1 6.6 Future expense inflation: UK business 3.9 3.9 International business 3.15 3.6 UK corporation tax rate 30 30 Risk discount rate average : In-force UK business 7.4 8.0 In-force International business 6.3 6.9 Risk discount rate: New business UK business 6.5 6.6 New business International business 6.0 6.4 i For UK and FPI business the risk-free rate is set with reference to the gilt yield curve at the valuation date.
For annuity and with-profits business, a term-dependent rate allowing for the shape of the yield curve is used as this can significantly impact value.
For other business, a rate based on the annualised 15-year gilt yield is used.
2005 2004 Lombard: % % Risk-free rate 3.6 4.1 Investment returns before tax 4.9 5.2 Future expense inflation 3.5 3.5 Tax rate 25.8 25.8 Risk discount rate average in-force 6.3 6.9 Risk discount rate average new business 6.3 6.9 The key exchange rates used in respect of Lombard business were a closing exchange rate of 1 Euro 0.687 2004: 1 Euro 0.707 and an average exchange rate over the year of 1 Euro 0.685.
Margins are added to the risk-free rates to obtain investment return assumptions for equity and property.
For corporate fixed interest securities the investment return assumptions are derived from an AA-bond yield spread, limited to the actual return on the underlying assets.
As we have followed a market-consistent approach, these investment return assumptions affect only the derived risk discount rates and not the embedded value result.
Maintenance expenses are assumed to increase in the future at a rate of 1% per annum for UK business and 0.25% per annum for International business excluding Lombard in excess of the assumed long-term rate of retail price inflation.
This is derived from the difference between the risk-free rate of return and the average of the FTSE Actuaries over five-year index-linked gilt at 5% and 0% inflation.
For Lombard the risk-free rate is the average of the 1015 year and the over 15 year yields using the EuroMTS indices.
The investment return assumption is the weighted average based on asset mix of returns on fixed interest securities, equities and cash.
The Lombard investment return assumption is shown gross of tax, but net of fund management charges.

EEV assumptions continued Average derived risk discount rates are shown below for the embedded value and the contribution from new business.
The average derived risk discount rate for in-force has reduced over 2005 due mainly to a lower risk-free rate and a lower risk margin on annuities.
A more detailed split of the derived risk discount rates is given in the following table.
Derived risk discount rates by product type 31 December 2005 International Embedded Value UK with-profits UK annuity Other UK Sterling Euro %%%%% Risk-free rate 4.1 4.1 4.1 4.1 3.6 Market risks non-options 3.0 6.0 1.7 1.3 1.9 Options market risks 4.0 - - - - Options non-market risks 3.3 - - - - Other non-market risks 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.8 0.8 Risk discount rate 14.8 10.5 6.2 6.2 6.3 Contribution from new business: International UK Sterling Euro %%% Risk-free rate 4.1 4.1 3.6 Market risks 2.0 1.1 1.9 Non-market risks 0.4 0.8 0.8 Risk discount rate 6.5 6.0 6.3 These tables show that with-profits and annuity business is subject to more investment risk than the remaining business, and so the appropriate risk discount rates are higher.
7.2 Principal economic assumptions stochastic The cost of options and guarantees is determined using The Smith Model economic scenario generator.
The model is calibrated to market conditions at the valuation date and correlations between the asset classes are derived from historic data, consistent with the model used for the Realistic Balance Sheet.
Risk-free rates are calibrated to the Gilt yield curve.
Equity volatility is calibrated to replicate the implied volatility of FTSE 100 put options held by the With Profits Fund.
Property holdings are modelled as a mix of equity and gilt assets, calibrated to derive a level of running yield and volatility as observed in historical data.
Sample implied volatilities by asset class Term years 31 December 2005 5152535 15-year risk-free zero coupon bonds 8.7 5.0 4.4 5.0 15-year corporate bonds 9.8 7.9 7.7 7.6 Equity 17.7 19.8 21.6 21.7 Property 14.9 17.2 19.2 19.3 Bonus rates are set at levels which fully utilise the assets supporting the in-force business over its lifetime and are consistent with the economic assumptions and the Groups bonus policy.
