793529 2030 3 6 05 10:42 Page 93 Factors affecting the tax charge in future years Factors that may affect the Groups future tax charge include the absence of one-off restructuring benets, the resolution of open issues, future planning opportunities, corporate acquisitions and disposals, changes in tax legislation and rates, and the use of brought forward tax losses.
In particular, the Groups subsidiary, Vodafone 2, is responding to an enquiry by the UK Inland Revenue with regard to the UK tax treatment of one of its Luxembourg holding companies under the controlled foreign companies rules.
Further details in relation to this enquiry are included in Risk Factors and Legal Proceedings.
At 31 March 2005, Vodafone has provided for 1,600 million tax and 157 million interest in respect of the potential UK tax liability that may arise in respect of this enquiry.
At 31 March 2004, the respective provisions were 1,335 million and 62 million.
Vodafone considers these amounts are sufficient to settle any assessments that may arise from the enquiry.
However, the amount ultimately paid may differ materially from the amount accrued and, therefore, could affect the overall profitability of the Group in future periods.
In the absence of any material unexpected developments, the provisions are likely to be reassessed when the views of the European Court of Justice become known, which is expected to be during 2006.
At 31 March 2005, the Group had the following trading and non-trading losses available for carry forward.
These losses are available for offset against future trading and non-trading profits of certain Group and associated undertakings: Expiring within Expiring within 5 years 10 years Unlimited Total m m m m UK subsidiaries trading and non-trading losses 2,035 2,035 International subsidiaries trading and non-trading losses 92 1,035 34,527 35,654 The losses in respect of UK subsidiaries include an amount of 1,870 million that is only available for offset against future capital gains and since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
The losses in respect of international subsidiaries include amounts of 30,857 million 2004: 30,728 million that have arisen in overseas holding companies as a result of revaluations of those companies investments for local GAAP purposes.
Since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
In addition to the losses described above, the Group has potential tax losses of 34,674 million 2004: 33,763 million in respect of a write down in the value of investments in Germany.
These losses have to date been denied by the German Tax Authorities.
Vodafone is now in discussions with them regarding the availability of the losses, however the outcome of these discussions and the timing of the resolution are not yet known.
The Group has not recognised the availability of the losses, nor the benefit arising from them, due to this uncertainty.
If upon resolution a benefit is recognised, it may impact both the amount of current income taxes provided since the date of initial deduction and the amount of benefit from tax losses the Group will recognise.
The recognition of these benets could affect the overall profitability of the Group in future periods.
Dividends that would have been paid on these shares would have been 124 million for the year ended 31 March 2005 2004: 9 million: 2003: nil had they qualied.
