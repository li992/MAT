The key focus of financial risk management for the Group is ensuring that the proceeds from its financial assets are sufficient to fund the obligations arising from its insurance and investment contracts and banking operations.
The most important components of financial risk are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, equity price risk, currency risk and credit risk.
These risks arise from open positions in interest rate, currency and equity products, all of which are exposed to general and specific market movements.
a Financial Risk Management strategy and policy Overview The Old Mutual Group operates an Enterprise Risk Management ERM framework.
The current risk framework contains the following components: a robust risk governance structure: risk appetites established at Group and subsidiary level: Group-wide risk policies: and methodologies that focus on risk identification, risk measurement, risk assessment, action plans, monitoring and reporting.
Group risk principles have been established for each major risk category to which the Group is exposed.
These are designed to provide management teams across the Group with guiding principles within which to manage risks.
Business unit risk policies expand on these principles and contain detailed requirements and or limits for the specific business unit concerned.
Further details regarding the ERM framework and risk governance procedures are contained in the Corporate Governance statement on pages 46 to 59 of these Annual Reports and Accounts.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 169 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 continued 49 FINANCIAL RISK continued a Financial Risk Management strategy and policy continued The Groups exposure to financial risk varies according to the nature of its operations and its location.
Consequently the Groups policy is to manage financial risk separately through its principal operations subject to appropriate central corporate monitoring.
The Groups principal operations that incur significant financial risk are: Old Mutual plc Nedbank Group Nedbank Old Mutual Life Assurance Company South Africa OMLAC SA Old Mutual US Life OMUSL Mutual & Federal Insurance Company Ltd Mutual & Federal The Groups asset management businesses are exposed to financial risk due to the impact of market fluctuations on revenue levels, which are a function of the value of client portfolios.
This exposure is reduced through product diversification.
Investment risk is borne principally by the client.
These asset management operations, and other long-term insurance operations in the rest of Africa do not give rise to significant financial risks relative to the Group as a whole.
i Old Mutual plc The principal financial risks Old Mutual plc faces, other than those that it is exposed to via its operating entities, relate to credit risk, liquidity risk and currency risk.
Credit risk arises primarily as a result of the exposure to financial institutions with which Old Mutual plc has deposited surplus cash or entered into other financial arrangements, such as forward foreign exchange transactions or interest rate derivatives.
Liquidity risk is the risk that Old Mutual plc may not be able to pay obligations when due, or provide capital to its subsidiaries when required.
Old Mutual plc mitigates this risk by ensuring it maintains liquid assets and or committed finance facilities sufficient to meet its expected needs.
In terms of currency risk, the principal exposure arises from the fact that the Groups functional currency is GBP, whereas the functional currencies of its principal operations are South African Rand and US Dollar.
Old Mutual plc seeks to mitigate any currency exposure to currencies other than GBP.
The Group hedges part of the currency translation risk of its net investments in its foreign subsidiaries through currency swaps, currency borrowings and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The hedging relationships are classified as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
As a result of the stricter designation and documentation requirements for hedge accounting under IAS 39, certain transactions undertaken as hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS for 2004.
Fair value movements for these derivatives were accounted for through the income statement.
ii Nedbank Nedbank incurs credit and market risk by accepting deposits from customers at both fixed and floating rates and for various periods and seeks to earn above average interest margins by consolidating them and investing in a range of assets, often for longer periods, whilst maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet all claims that might fall due.
It also incurs credit exposures as a result of entering into guarantees and other commitments such as letters of credit and performance, and other bonds.
Nedbank also trades in financial instruments, taking positions in traded and over the counter instruments including derivatives, in order to take advantage of short-term market movements in equity, bond, currency, interest rate and commodity prices.
Nedbanks board controls this risk by placings trading limits on the level of exposure that can be taken in relation to both overnight and intra-day market positions.
With the exception of specific hedging arrangements, foreign exchange and interest rate exposures associated with these derivatives are generally offset by entering into counterbalancing positions, thereby controlling the variability in the net cash amounts required to liquidate market positions.
Asset and liability management is conducted within a formal structure.
The Nedbank Asset & Liability Management function provides support to the Nedbank Asset and Liability Committee ALCO and Executive Risk Committee EXCO in the management of interest rate risk, liquidity risk and currency translation risk, providing the necessary strategic support including risk based modelling, analysis, management information and strategic recommendations.
This structure is not heavily reliant on trading securities and derivatives, but focuses on using on-balance sheet mechanisms.
iii OMLAC SA, OMUSL and M&F insurance operations OMLAC SA, OMUSL and M&F manage their financial risks using asset liability management ALM frameworks aimed at matching assets to the liabilities arising from insurance and investment contracts by reference to the type of benefits payable to policyholders, as well as seeking to maximise the return on shareholders funds, all within an acceptable risk framework.
The insurance operations retain substantial exposures to the extent that the benefits payable to policyholders are not linked to the performance of the underlying assets and or policyholders enjoy options embedded in their contracts which are not matched by identical options in the underlying investments.
These exposures include duration risk, credit risk and market risk.
Old Mutual plc 170 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 49 FINANCIAL RISK continued b Capital adequacy OMLAC SA, OMUSL and other long-term business operations During December 2004, the UK Accounting Standards Board ASB released Financial Reporting Standard 27 Life Assurance FRS 27 with implementation for the years ending on or after 23 December 2005.
The Group has decided to provide these disclosures, despite not being required under IFRS.
The capital position of the Groups life businesses, based on latest estimates, is summarised as follows: m At 31 December 2005 At 31 December 2004 North Rest of North Rest of Africa America World Africa America World Equity shareholders funds 4,201 1,299 40 3,420 1,228 22 Adjustments to a regulatory basis: Inadmissible assets 26 66 8 33 55 Other adjustments 902 746 10 696 716 Total available capital resources 3,273 487 22 2,691 457 22 Total capital requirements local regulatory basis 1,079 196 2 1,038 160 1 Overall excess of capital resources over requirements 2,194 291 20 1,653 297 21 m Year to 31 December 2005 North Rest of Africa America World Capital position at 1 January 2005 2,691 457 22 Earnings after tax 1,043 100 2 Change in admissible assets and other adjustments 291 1 2 New capital 81 Dividends 192 Foreign exchange rate movements 22 50 Capital position at 31 December 2005 3,273 487 22 Africa The amounts disclosed above represent the capital position of OMLAC SA and the life business in Namibia.
The calculations are determined in accordance with the requirements of the South African Financial Services Board, using reliable estimates of the regulatory adjustments, as the relevant regulatory returns have yet to be completed.
At 31 December 2005, OMLAC SA s excess assets was 3.0 times 2004: 2.6 times the statutory capital adequacy requirement SCAR, after allowing for reliable estimates of statutory limitations on the value of certain assets.
The statutory solvency requirement for Namibia is N$4 million 0.4 million 2004: N$4 million 0.4 million.
The calculations have been determined on the South African statutory basis, which is more prudent than the statutory basis in Namibia.
OMLAC SA s equity shareholders funds include its investments in Nedbank 1,377 million 2004: 928 million and Mutual & Federal 514 million 2004: 486 million.
In addition, 294 million 2004: 261 million is invested in the Groups loan notes and 514 million 2004: 198 million is held in intercompany loans.
All intercompany loans are immediately repayable and subject to commercial terms and conditions, with the exception that interest may be waived in certain circumstances.
The amount of the surplus available to be distributed as dividends to the ultimate parent, Old Mutual plc, is subject to available distributable reserves within the shareholders fund, maintaining the minimum statutory capital adequacy requirement and foreign exchange controls, as determined by the South African Reserve Bank.
United States In the case of OMUSL, the amounts disclosed above represent the consolidated capital position of the OMUSL group of companies, including Fidelity & Guaranty Life Assurance Company, Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company of New York, Omnia Life Insurance Company, American Life & Annuity Insurance Company, OMNIA Bermuda Limited and Old Mutual Reassurance Ireland Limited.
The calculations have been determined on the basis of local regulatory requirements for the United States, Bermuda and Ireland accordingly.
The amount of the surplus available to be distributed as dividends to the ultimate parent, Old Mutual plc, is subject to available distributable reserves within the entities and the requirement to maintain the minimum statutory capital requirements, being 100% of the risk-based capital referred to as the Company Action Level.

Old Mutual International has been included on the basis of the Guernsey regulatory requirements.
The amount of the surplus available to be distributed as dividends to the ultimate parent, Old Mutual plc, is subject to available distributable reserves within the shareholders fund, and maintaining the minimum statutory capital adequacy requirement.
Capital management policies Capital is actively managed to ensure that the Group is properly capitalised and funded at all times, having regard to its regulatory needs, prudent management and the needs of all stakeholders.
The Group has a business planning process that runs on an annual cycle with regular updates to projections.
It is through this process, which includes risk and sensitivity analyses of forecasts, and the operations of the Group Capital Management Committee GCMC, that the operating businesses gain approval from the Old Mutual plc board for their requests for capital.
The GCMC is a sub-committee of the Executive Committee of the board, established to set an appropriate framework and guidelines to ensure the appropriate management of capital, to allocate capital to the various businesses, and to monitor return on allocated capital for each business relative to the agreed hurdle rate.
The GCMC comprises the Executive Directors of Old Mutual plc together with certain executives drawn from Old Mutual plc and or one or more subsidiaries.
Meetings are held as circumstances require and not less than half-yearly to approve requests for capital that are outside the business plans.
In terms of general policy, each regulated business is required to hold, as a minimum, capital sufficient to meet the requirements of any applicable regulator in respect of its business in the jurisdictions in which it operates, together with such additional capital as management believes is necessary to ensure that obligations to policyholders and or clients can always be met on a timely basis.
In addition, Old Mutual plc ensures that it can meet its expected capital and financing needs at all times, having regard to the Groups business plans, forecasts and any strategic initiatives.
From 1 January 2005, the Group became subject to the UK Financial Services Authoritys Group capital adequacy requirements, established following introduction of the EU Financial Groups Directive.
Management regularly monitors the capital requirements of the Group, taking account of future balance sheet growth, profitability, projected dividend payments and any anticipated regulatory changes, in order to ensure that the Group is at all times able to meet the forecast future minimum capital requirements.
Sensitivities The Group has both qualitative and quantitative risk management procedures to monitor, at the individual company and Group levels, the key risks and sensitivities of the business.
This is achieved through stress tests, scenario analyses and individual risk assessments by the operating businesses.
From an understanding of the principal risks, the Group defines appropriate risk limits and controls.
The key risks affecting the surplus capital of the Group are Market Risk, Credit Risk, Underwriting Risks and Business Risks.
For further details of specific financial risks, refer to relevant sections of this note.
c Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not be able to pay amounts in full when due in accordance with the terms of a contract.
i Nedbank Credit risk is the most significant risk type facing Nedbank, accounting for over 70% of its economic capital requirements and arises from its core business of lending.
Credit Risk Management Framework Credit risk is managed in terms of a Credit Risk Management Framework CRF, which encompasses comprehensive credit policy, mandate limits and governance structures, and is approved by the Nedbank Board.
Divisional credit committees DCCs, with chairmen independent of the business units, operate for all major business units across Nedbank.
The DCCs are responsible for approving and recommending credit and credit policy, as well as reviewing credit portfolios and impairments.
In addition, an independent Credit Risk Monitoring CRM Unit, which champions the ongoing enhancement of credit risk management across Nedbank, and the CRF monitor, credit portfolios and report to executive management, the DCCs and ultimately the boards Credit Committee, on a regular basis.
The CRM Unit is responsible for the new Basel II  IRB methodology being implemented across Nedbank, and the related independent validation requirements.
In each of the business clusters, credit risk management functions operate independently of credit origination, reporting into the cluster head of risk, who in turn report to the cluster managing director.
In line with the new Basel ll IRB methodology being implemented, centres of excellence in the form of cluster credit labs have been established.
These labs are responsible for the ongoing design, implementation, validation and performance of their clusters internal rating systems, with input and oversight by the central Nedbank credit ratings function.
Old Mutual plc 172 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 49 FINANCIAL RISK continued c Credit Risk continued i Nedbank continued To manage and optimise Nedbanks credit portfolios and credit concentration risk, a Credit Portfolio Management Unit was established in the Basel ll office, including the building of a sophisticated credit portfolio model.
This unit is housed in the Capital Management Division and provides credit economic capital or credit value-at-risk and other key inputs e. g. financial risk aggregation and analysis to capital management.
It also has an indirect reporting line into CRM and is assisting with the establishment of sophisticated credit portfolio management within the three cluster credit labs discussed above.
The Credit Portfolio Model, which is run on a monthly basis, covers all the business units in Nedbank, both retail and wholesale, as well as domestic and international.
Credit Risk methodology and measurement In line with Nedbanks aspiration to be world-class at managing risk, the Advanced IRB credit methodology is being implemented for all material credit portfolios.
Under this methodology, credit risk is essentially measured by two key components: Expected Loss EL, which is the estimated, annual average level of credit losses through a full credit cycle: and Unexpected Loss UL, which is the annual volatility of expected losses for credit.
EL and UL are defined as the average and standard deviation of the distribution of potential losses inherent in the banks credit portfolio.
Credit risk economic capital is calculated using credit portfolio modelling based on the volatility of expected losses.
These estimated losses are given by the key credit risk parameters Probability of Default, Exposure at Default, Loss Given Default and Maturity.
The credit risk economic capital is derived by taking portfolio concentrations and diversifications into account.

Neither operation cedes significant risk through reinsurance and any policyholder loans are secured on the surrender value of the policyholders policies.
Credit risk is managed by placing limits on exposure to a single counterparty, or groups of counterparties, and to geographical and industry segments.
Credit risk is monitored with reference to established credit rating agencies with limits placed on exposure to below investment grade holdings.

Mutual & Federal structures the levels of credit risk it accepts by placing limits on its exposure to a single counterparty, or groups of counterparties, and to geographical and industry segments.
Such risks are subject to an annual or more frequent review.
Internal audit performs regular reviews to assess the degree of compliance with the group procedures on credit.
Exposures to individual policyholders and groups of policyholders are monitored as part of the credit control process.
For significant exposures to individual policyholders, or homogeneous groups of policyholders, a financial analysis is carried out by Mutual & Federals risk department.
Reputable financial institutions are used for investing and cash handling purposes.
All money market instruments and cash equivalents are placed with institutions that have credit ratings of at least AA-.
Under the terms of reinsurance agreements, reinsurers agree to reimburse the ceded amount in the event that a claim is paid.
However, Mutual & Federal remains liable to its policyholders with respect to ceded insurance if any reinsurer fails to meet the obligations it assumes and, consequently, is exposed to credit risk.
Mutual & Federal assesses its relative security in respect of a reinsurer based upon public rating information and from internal investigations.

d Market Risk Market risk is the potential impact on earnings of unfavourable changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, prices, market volatilities and liquidity.
Market risk includes trading risk, derivative instruments used for hedging risk in non-trading portfolios, investment risk, exchange rate risk and interest rate risk in the banking book.
Investment risk arises from changes in the fair value of investments and includes private equity, property and strategic investments.
Market Risk management procedures i Nedbank Market risk in Nedbank arises from three main activities: Interest rate risk arises from all business clusters.
Asset and liability management ALM is the responsibility of the specialised ALM function.
This function also covers liquidity and foreign currency translation risks in the banking book, which is treated in more detail later: Investment risk arises only in the private equity and property portfolios within Nedbank Capital and Nedbank Corporate respectively: and Trading risk applies mainly to Nedbank Capital.
Market Risk management A comprehensive Market Risk Framework is used to support and assist the Nedbank board in its responsibility to oversee that market risks are understood and managed.
Governance structures are in place to achieve effective independent monitoring and management of market risk as follows: the Nedbank Boards Risk Committee: the Asset and Liability Committee ALCO and the Executive Risk Committee, which are responsible for ensuring that the impact of market risks is being effectively managed and reported on throughout Nedbank, and that all policy, risk limit and relevant market risk issues are reported to the Risk Committee: the Market and Trading Risk Control function within the Risk Division, which monitors market risks across Nedbank.
This is a specialist risk area that provides an independent oversight of market risk in terms of identifying, measuring, analysing, monitoring and reporting, as well as ensuring that appropriate controls are in place to manage market risk, and that consistent risk measures are applied: and the federal model in which business clusters are responsible and accountable for the management of the market risks that emanate from their activities.
There are specialist investment risk committees within the business areas that are responsible for the approval and periodic reviews of investments in their respective divisions clusters, and investments may be made only by a properly constituted investment committee.
Where banking facilities are to be extended to entities in which the bank has invested, the approval of such banking facilities is the responsibility of the relevant credit risk management committee, which also takes a holistic view of counterparty exposures.
The board approves the market risk appetite and related limits, for both banking book asset and liability management and investments and trading book.
Market and Trading Risk Control reports on the market risk portfolio and is instrumental in ensuring that market risk limits are compatible with a level of risk acceptable to the Nedbank board.
Old Mutual plc 176 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 49 FINANCIAL RISK continued d Market Risk continued i Nedbank continued Market Risk management continued Risk taking in Nedbanks trading activities remained within the market risk appetite and limits at all times during the year.
Trading risk methodology and measurement Trading market risk management processes and methodologies are benchmarked against best practice on an ongoing basis.
Enhancements are assessed and implemented in consultation with the business clusters.
Market risk associated with trading activities is a result of transactions in foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity markets.
Instruments actively deployed are spot and forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, bonds, bond options, equities and equity derivatives.
Currency options, commodities and commodity derivatives are traded on a limited basis.
Market risk exposures for trading activities are measured using value-at-risk VaR, supplemented by sensitivity analysis, and stress-scenario analysis, and limit structures are set accordingly.
The VaR risk measure estimates the potential loss in pre-tax profit over a given holding period for a specified confidence level.
The VaR methodology is a statistically defined, probability-based approach that takes into account market volatilities as well as risk diversification by recognising offsetting positions and correlations between products and markets.
Risks can be measured consistently across all markets and products, and risk measures can be aggregated to arrive at a single risk number.
The one-day 99% VaR number used by Nedbank represents the overnight loss that has less than 1% chance of occurring under normal market conditions.
VaR methodologies employed to calculate daily risk numbers include the historical and variance-covariance approaches.
In addition to these two methodologies, Monte Carlo simulations are applied to the various portfolios on a monthly basis to determine potential future exposure.
While VaR captures Nedbanks exposure under normal market conditions, sensitivity and scenario analysis, including stress testing, is used to add insight to the possible outcomes under abnormal market conditions.
Nedbank uses a number of stress scenarios to measure the impact on portfolio values of extreme moves in markets, based on historical experience as well as hypothetical scenarios.
The stress-test methodology assumes that all market factors move adversely at the same time and that no actions are taken during the stress events to mitigate risk, reflecting the decreased liquidity that frequently accompanies market shocks.
m Historical VaR one-day, 99% by risk type Average Minimum Maximum Year-end At 31 December 2005 Foreign exchange 0.2 0.0 0.5 0.2 Interest rate 1.4 0.9 2.3 1.3 Equity products 1.0 0.4 1.6 0.9 Diversification 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.4 Total VaR exposure 2.0 1.5 2.9 2.0 The monitoring of trading credit risk exposures within Nedbank includes a total risk exposure measure, made up of current market value plus potential future exposure.
Monte Carlo simulations are used to calculate potential future exposure.
In terms of active management of credit risk, there is continued emphasis on the use of credit mitigation strategies, such as netting and collateralisation of exposures.
These strategies have been particularly effective in situations where there has been a high risk of default.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 177 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 continued 49 FINANCIAL RISK continued d Market Risk continued ii OMLAC SA OMUSL In South Africa the stock selection and investment analysis process is supported by a well-developed research function.
For fixed annuities, market risks are managed by investing in fixed interest securities with a duration closely corresponding to those liabilities.
Market risks on policies that include specific guarantees and the investment risk is carried by the shareholders, principally reside in the South African guaranteed non-profit annuity book, which is closely matched with gilts and semi-gilts.
Other non-profit policies are also suitably matched based upon comprehensive investment guidelines.
Market risks on with-profit policies, where investment risk is shared, are minimised by appropriate bonus declaration practices.
Equity price risk and interest rate risk on the value of the securities are modelled in accordance with the Groups risk-based capital practices, which require sufficient capital to be held in excess of the statutory minimum to allow the Group to manage significant equity exposures.
In the US, for fixed annuities, policyholder option risk is managed by investing in fixed securities with durations within a half-year of the duration of the liabilities.
Cash flows in any period are closely aligned to ensure any mismatch is not material.
In addition, extensive interest rate scenario testing is carried out, as required by regulatory authorities in the US, in order to ensure that the amounts reserved are sufficient to meet the guaranteed obligations.
The guaranteed returns provided under Equity Index Annuities are dynamically hedged to ensure a close matching of option payoffs to the liability growth.
Hedging positions are reviewed daily to re-adjust them as necessary.
iii Mutual & Federal Asset liability matching A distinction is drawn between insurance and shareholders funds and the following strategies are adopted for each: Insurance funds The overall philosophy governing the investment of funds backing reserves is driven by liquidity considerations and a strong emphasis on capital preservation.
The maturity profile of investments approximates the average term of operational liabilities.
To this end, funds are invested predominately in fixed interest bearing investments with durations not exceeding five years.
Shareholder funds Shareholder funds are invested in a broader spread of investments including equities, reflecting the more stable nature of the fund pool and the desire to achieve strong real returns over the long-term.
The spread of investments is constructed in such a manner as to guarantee operational capacity solvency margin at all times.
The extent of investment in equities will be expressed as a ratio of shareholders funds as determined by the Mutual & Federal board from time to time, taking into consideration solvency issues and shareholder expectations.
Equity price risk The portfolio of marketable equity securities, which is carried on the balance sheet at fair value, has exposure to price risk.
This risk is defined as the potential loss in market value resulting from an adverse change in prices.
The objective is to earn competitive relative returns by investing in a diverse portfolio of high quality, liquid securities.
Portfolio characteristics are analysed regularly and equity price risk is actively managed through a variety of modelling techniques.
Holdings are diversified across industries, and concentrations in any one company or industry are limited by parameters established by senior management, as well as by statutory requirements.
iv Currency Risk The Group takes on exposure to effects of fluctuations in the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates on its financial position and cash flows.
The principal foreign currency risk arises from the fact that the Groups functional currency is GBP, whereas the functional currency of its principal operations is South African Rand and US Dollar.
The Group hedges this currency translation risk through currency swaps, currency borrowings and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Nedbank sets limits on the level of exposure by currency, and in total, for both overnight and intra-day positions.
The long-term business operations policy is to hedge against certain currency exposures where assets and matching, or associated, liabilities are in different currencies.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward exchange contracts, currency options and currency swap agreements.
Investments in foreign assets are made on behalf of policyholders and shareholders for the purpose of seeking desirable international diversification of investments.
Cash flow hedges A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability and could affect profit or loss.
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity and reported in the income statement at the same time as the cash flow being hedged.
The Group hedges its foreign currency risk on its Euro loan borrowings by entering into foreign currency swaps for GBP.
The swaps gave rise to currency losses for the year of 16 million which for 2005 have been deferred in equity and hedge gains from the revaluation of the underlying liability.
The swaps had an aggregate notional principal of 296 million and a fair value of 33 million.
The repayment of principal is scheduled to occur as follows: 400 million on 10 April 2007, 30 million on 11 July 2010, 10 million on 23 December 2010, and 20 million on 6 August 2013.
The cash flow hedge reserve will be released to the income statement over this period of time to offset the currency movements on the loan.
During 2005, 8 million was released to offset currency movements on the interest paid.
Old Mutual plc 178 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 49 FINANCIAL RISK continued d Market Risk continued iv Currency Risk continued Net investment hedges A hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is a hedge against the foreign currency exposure to changes in the reporting entitys share in the net assets of that foreign operation.
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity and only reported in the income statement on disposal of the foreign entity.
The Group is exposed to changes in the GBP USD exchange rate in respect of its investments in its US subsidiaries.
To mitigate this exposure, the Group has entered into cross currency swaps to swap GBP liabilities for USD.
The swaps had an aggregate notional principal of 222 million and a fair value of 49 million.
The swaps gave rise to currency losses for the year of 18 million, which have been deferred in equity.
In addition the Group has USD denominated borrowings that form a natural hedge against the foreign currency exposure of investments in foreign operations.
The borrowings had an aggregate fair value of 15 million.
In addition, Old Mutual plc entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to offset currency exposure in its US subsidiaries.
The movements in the fair value of the forward hedges off set the fair value movements of the US subsidiaries and are taken directly to the Net Investment Hedge Reserve.
At 31 December 2005, the forwards had an aggregate notional principal of 474 million and fair value of 4 million.
Given the lack of deep and liquid markets for African trading currencies and the size of currency-related risks, the Group does not currently hedge translation risk for African countries.
The Group does however hedge foreign currency risk arising on Rand financial assets by its South African operations by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts.
At 31 December 2005, the forwards had an aggregate notional principal of 50 million and a fair value of 1 million.
The table below summarises the Groups exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk at 31 December.

Hedging activities are evaluated regularly in order to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest income through different interest rate cycles.
An independent ALM committee monitors the structural interest rate risk profile of the banking book, making strategic interest rate risk recommendations to the ALCO.
On-balance sheet strategies are executed through any one of the respective business units, depending on the strategy, whilst derivative strategies are executed through an established ALM desk that trades via independent market making desks housed in the trading environment.
Changes to the structural interest rate risk profile of the banking book are primarily achieved through the use of derivative instruments, particularly with FRAs of up to 1 year in duration and swap agreements used to manage longer dated risk.
Nedbank employs standard analytical techniques to measure interest rate sensitivity within the banking book.
This includes static re-price gap analysis and a point-in-time interest income stress test for parallel interest rate moves over a forward-looking 12-month period.
At 31 December 2005 the sensitivity of the banking book to a 1% parallel reduction in interest rates was 36 million, being 4.6% of total Nedbank interest income at risk or 1.49% of total Nedbank equity, well within the approved risk limit of 2%.
Interest rate risk portfolio review Nedbank is primarily exposed to interest rate risk, because: the bank writes a large quantum of prime-linked assets and raises fewer prime-linked deposits: funding is prudently raised across the curve at fixed-term deposit rates that re-price only on maturity: short-term demand-funding products re-price to different short-end base rates: certain ambiguous maturity accounts are non-rate-sensitive: and the bank has a mismatch in net non-rate-sensitive balances, including shareholders funds, that do not re-price for interest rate changes.

The interest rate risk of such liabilities is managed by investing in assets of similar duration.
Derivative instruments are not used to any material extent to manage the interest rate risk of these long-term assets and liabilities.
OMUSL monitors interest rate risk by calculating the mean duration of their investment portfolios and liabilities issued.
The mean duration is an indicator of the sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates.
The mean duration of the liabilities is determined by means of projected expected cash flows from the contracts using best estimates of mortality and voluntary terminations.
No future discretionary supplemental benefits are assumed to accrue.
The mean duration of the assets is calculated in a consistent manner.
Any gap between the mean duration of the assets and liabilities is minimised by buying and selling fixed interest securities of different durations.
iii Mutual & Federal Fluctuations in interest rates impact on the value of short-term cash investments, giving rise to price risk.
Other than ensuring optimum money market rates for deposits, Mutual & Federal does not make use of financial instruments to manage this risk.
Formal policies, procedures and limits have been put in place for derivative instruments.

i Nedbank Nedbanks daily liquidity requirements are managed by a team within Nedbank Treasury with significant market experience.
Net daily funding requirements are pre-determined by planning for daily roll-overs, managing pipeline deal flow and actively managing daily settlements.
This includes regular interaction with large demand depositors in order to understand and manage their drawdown requirements.
The net cash flow requirements are then managed primarily via the professional market and monitored by the independent ALM function that performs behavioural modelling and stress analyses to identify any potential stress cash flow requirements.
Both medium and long-term liquidity strategies are approved by the ALCO and implemented by the front end of the business, usually through Treasury.
Nedbank ALCO monitors funding and liquidity management on a regular basis with the support of the ALM function that reports and models appropriate risk based management information.
Appropriate liquidity risk dashboards have been built to provide ALCO members and the nonexecutive members of the Group Risk Committee with the necessary liquidity risk information on a regular basis, including a measure of compliance with approved policies and limits.
Currently there are various additional liquidity initiatives in progress that will further enhance the liquidity management of Nedbank including, for example, securitisation.
This is seen as a market that currently provides an untapped avenue of further funding diversity and contingency planning.
The table below analyses assets and liabilities of Nedbanks banking activities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at balance sheet date to the contractual maturity or repayment date.
The OMSA and OMUSL long-term business liabilities are backed by sufficient readily realisable investments and or facilities to cover cash calls arising from maturities, claims and the surrender of policies, including at unexpected levels of demand.
iii Mutual & Federal Mutual & Federal is exposed to daily calls on its available cash resources mainly from claims arising.
Liquidity risk is the risk that cash may not be available to pay obligations when due at a reasonable cost.
Mutual & Federal sets limits on the minimum proportions of maturing funds available to meet its expected needs even in stressed situations.

g Fiduciary Activities The Group provides custody, trustee, corporate administration, investment management and advisory services to third parties that involve the Group making allocation and purchase and sale decisions in relation to a wide range of financial instruments.
Those assets that are held in a fiduciary capacity are not included in these financial statements.
Some of these arrangements involve the Group accepting targets for benchmark levels of returns for the assets under the Groups care.
These services give rise to the risk that the Group will be accused of misadministration or under-performance.
Total funds under management are disclosed in note 3 ix.
h Company Only Financial Risk Disclosures The Company is exposed to financial risk through its financial assets, financial liabilities and intercompany balances.
The most important components of financial risk for the Company are interest rate risk, currency risk and credit risk.
The principal risk the Company faces is currency risk.
The Companys functional currency is GBP, whereas the functional currencies of its principal subsidiaries are South African Rand and US Dollar.
The Company seeks to mitigate any currency exposure to currencies other than GBP.
Currency Risk The Company takes on exposure to effects of fluctuations in the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates on its financial position and cash flows.
The principal foreign currency risk arises from the fact that the Companys functional currency is GBP, whereas the functional currency of its principal operations is South African Rand and US Dollar.
The Company hedges this currency translation risk through currency swaps, currency borrowings and forward foreign exchange rate contracts.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward exchange contracts and currency swap agreements.
