Share-based Payments continued For the 2005 plan cycle, the market capitalisation on 9 May 2005 was US$11.4 billion, the Participation Percentage was equal to 0.5% and the share price at the measurement date was US$18.00.
In addition to these parameters, the key inputs used within the valuation model were: Xstrata share 1 Xstrata plc Indices 2 Dividend yield % N A N A Expected volatility % 32% 21% Risk-free interest rate % 4.51% 4.51% Third anniversary of start of cycle 9 May 2008 9 May 2008 Fourth anniversary of start of cycle 9 May 2009 9 May 2009 Fifth anniversary of start of cycle 9 May 2010 9 May 2010 1.
There are two Xstrata Share Indices used within the valuation model: one is a market capitalisation weighted TSR index comprising 19 global mining firms who are considered to be Xstratas key competitors for both financial and human capital.
The other is a market capitalisation price index comprising the same 19 constituents.
When simulating the Xstrata Price Index, a dividend yield is included to account for the suppressing impact that a dividend payment has on the constituent share prices.
For the simulation of Xstratas TSR and the Index TSR a dividend yield is not required.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historic volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
There is no disclosure of the number of equity instruments granted as the AVP is not an award over a fixed number of shares.
