RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS At 31 December 2005 the Group operated a number of retirement benefit schemes, both defined benefit and defined contribution which are financed through separate Trustee administered funds managed by independent professional fund managers on behalf of the Trustees.
Contributions to the defined benefit funds are based upon actuarial advice following the most recent of a regular series of valuations of the funds by their representative independent actuaries.
Certain employees of Arriva Merseyside Limited participate in the Local Government Pension Scheme.
This is a defined benefit scheme funded by payments to the Merseyside Pension Fund.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Merseyside Pension Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2004.
Certain employees of Arriva Trains Wales Limited, and the former employees of Arriva Trains Northern Limited, participate in funded defined benefit sections which form part of the overall Railways Pension Scheme RPS.
Total pension cost The total pension cost for the Group was 39.7 million 2004: 46.9 million.
The pension costs in respect of the Groups defined contribution schemes was 17.1 million 2004: 22.9 million, including 5.6 million in respect of Arriva Trains Northern Limited.
Defined benefit plans The directors believe that separate consideration should be given to the RPS under IAS19 as the Group has no rights or obligations in respect of sections of this scheme following the expiry of the franchises.
The amounts relating to the rail schemes are therefore shown separately and relate to sections in respect of Arriva Trains Wales Limited only.
The calculations used to assess the IAS19 liabilities of the retirement benefit schemes are based on the most recent actuarial valuations, updated to 31 December 2005 by qualified independent actuaries.
The schemes' assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2005.

Deferred tax is not provided on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries where the Group has control over the timing of remittance and it is probable that remittance will not take place in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
