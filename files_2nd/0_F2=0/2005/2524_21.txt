In December 2002, the Group entered into further swap arrangements relating to 63.5 million of this debt, which arrangements were subsequently amended in March 2003 and July 2004, the effect of which was to fix the interest rate on 63.5 million at 5.990% until January 2004, after which time it reverted to a floating six months London Inter-Bank Offer Rate LIBOR plus a margin of 2.460%, except that should LIBOR be less than 2.750% for the period January to July 2004, 2.890% for the period July 2004 to January 2005, or 2.990% thereafter, the effective rate shall be deemed to be 7.653%.
After July 2004, the margin over LIBOR increases from 2.460% to 2.840%.
In order to increase its exposure to floating rates, in July 2003, the Group entered into another interest rate hedging arrangement in respect of a further 63.5 million of the above-mentioned debt, the effect of which was that, from July 2003 until July 2009, the Group will pay floating six months LIBOR plus a margin of 2.8175% on this 63.5 million, except that should LIBOR be less than 2.750% for the period January to July 2004, or less than 2.990% thereafter, the Group shall revert back to 7.653%.

In March 2004, the Group entered into an interest rate swap arrangement in respect of 50 million of this debt, whereby the previously fixed rate of 7.750% was swapped to a floating rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.050% from July 2004 to July 2005.
On 9 July 2005, and every 9 July thereafter, the counterparty had the right, but not the obligation, to cancel this swap, returning the Group to its previous fixed rate of 7.750%.
The counterparty cancelled this swap on 9 July 2005.

In July 2003, the Group entered into a further interest rate hedging arrangement in respect of 61.2 million of this swapped debt.
The effect of this new hedging arrangement was that, from July 2003 until February 2009, the Group will pay floating six months LIBOR plus a margin of 3.490% on 61.2 million of its swapped debt.
However, at each six monthly reset date, the counterparty to this transaction has the right to cancel the transaction with immediate effect.
In October 2003, the Group entered into a further interest rate hedging arrangement in respect of an additional 61.2 million of this swapped debt, the effect of which was to reduce the rate payable to 7.950% for the period August 2003 to February 2004.
Thereafter, until August 2006, the rate payable is 7.950% plus any margin by which the floating six monthly LIBOR reset rate exceeds the sum of the previous reset rate plus 0.500%.
Thereafter, the rate reverts to a fixed 8.180%.
In February 2005, the 7.95% interest rate on this swap was renegotiated to 8.02% with all the other aspects of the swap remaining unchanged.

At the time of issuing these notes, the Group entered into swap transactions to convert the dollar proceeds to pounds sterling 189 million, half of which carries a fixed rate of interest of 8.384% until maturity, payable semi-annually.
The remainder was fixed at 7.940% until 15 April 2002, thereafter floating at 0.620% over six months LIBOR, again payable semi-annually.

Undrawn Revolving Credit Facilities RCFs In November 2004, the Group entered into a 1 billion RCF.
This facility was used to cancel an existing 600 million RCF and is available for general corporate purposes.
The 1 billion facility has a maturity date of July 2010, and interest accrues at a margin of between 0.45% and 0.55% above LIBOR, dependent on the Groups leverage ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA as defined in the loan agreement.
At the current ratio of Net Debt: EBITDA, the margin would be 0.45% above LIBOR if the Group were to make a drawing on the facility.
Both the bank facilities and the publicly-traded guaranteed notes have been issued by the Company and are guaranteed by both British Sky Broadcasting Limited BSkyB Limited and Sky Subscribers Services Limited.
Additionally, the 1 billion RCF is guaranteed by BSkyB Investments Limited.

The fair values of other borrowings are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present value.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are estimated by calculating the differences between the contracted rates and the appropriate market rates prevailing at the period-ends.
The differences between book values and fair values reflect unrealised gains or losses inherent in the instruments, based on valuations as at 30 June 2005 and 30 June 2004.
The volatile nature of the markets means that values at any subsequent date could be significantly different from the values reported above.
In addition to the financial instruments in the above fair value table, the Group had holdings in the equity share capital of other listed investments at 30 June 2005 and 30 June 2004.

Included within the fair value of forward foreign currency contracts are a number of US denominated forward foreign exchange contracts which the Group has taken out with counterparty banks on behalf of two of its joint ventures: The History Channel UK and Nickelodeon UK.
On the same dates as these forward contracts were entered into, the Group entered into equal and opposite forward contracts with the respective joint ventures.
As a result, the net fair value of these contracts to the Group was nil.

25 Regulatory update European Commission Investigation Football Association Premier League Limited FAPL The European Commissions investigation into the FAPLs joint selling of exclusive broadcast rights to football matches has not yet concluded: the Commission published a notice on 30 April 2004 inviting third party comments on its intention to adopt a decision making commitments offered by the FAPL legally enforceable and to close its file.
Among other things, these commitments address the next auction of rights by the FAPL for the 2007 08 and subsequent seasons.
The outcome of this consultation has not yet been disclosed and the Commission has not yet adopted a decision.
The Commission confirmed last year in a comfort letter that, on the basis of performance by the Group of certain commitments given by the Group to the Commission, it has fully and finally settled the Commissions other investigations in connection with the Groups bids for all rights in relation to FAPL matches throughout the 2004 05 to 2006 07 FAPL seasons and any resulting agreements between the Group and the FAPL.
BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 Financial Statements PAGE 68 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 25 Regulatory update continued European Commission Investigation Movie Contracts The European Commission has announced in a press release dated 26 October 2004 that it has settled and closed its investigations with a number of major US movie studios into the terms on which movies produced by them are supplied to distributors, including pay television operators, throughout the European Union.
The investigations centred on the inclusion of most favoured nations MFN clauses in these studios output agreements and the settlements centred on commitments offered by certain of the studios to phase out all MFN clauses in their output agreements.
The Commission stated in its press release that two studios had not, however, offered to phase out such clauses, in relation to which it appears that the Commissions case remains open.
The Commission has not published any further statement or final or provisional decision indicating the actual terms on which it has closed its investigation.
European Commission Sector Inquiry New Media Sports Rights In January 2004, the European Commission launched a sector inquiry regarding the conditions of provision of audio-visual content from sports events to internet and other new media companies such as 3G mobile operators.
The European Commission has stated that the purpose of its investigation is to gain as clear and wide a view as possible of the availability of audio-visual sports rights in the European Union, so as to ascertain whether access by new media operators to such content is not unduly restricted.
In May 2005, the European Commission published the preliminary findings of the sector inquiry which sets out a number of business practices which it considers could give rise to competition concerns.
At this stage, the Group is unable to determine whether the investigation will have a material effect on the Group.
Ofcom Review of Conditional Access Guidelines In May 2005, the Office of Communications Ofcom initiated a review of its guidelines entitled The pricing of conditional access services and related issues.
