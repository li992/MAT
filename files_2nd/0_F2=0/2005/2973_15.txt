Notes to the accounts 1 Principal accounting policies a Accounting convention The Accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and the Companies Act 1985.
The transitional disclosures associated with the adoption of FRS17 have been applied.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently, except where noted below, in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the accounts of the Company, its UK subsidiary undertakings and its Belgium and The Netherlands subsidiaries made up to 30 April 2005.
The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted for acquisitions made during the period.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Intra group transactions are fully eliminated on consolidation.
Under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
c Turnover Turnover represents the value of goods and services sold to customers, excluding value added tax, recognised at the point the Group has substantially fulfilled its obligations to the customer.
d Intangible fixed assets Purchased brand names and other intangible fixed assets are capitalised at cost.
Purchased goodwill and goodwill arising on consolidation are capitalised based on the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the separable net assets acquired.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Belgium and The Netherlands is accounted for in Euros.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of all positive intangible fixed assets in equal monthly instalments over their estimated useful lives not exceeding 20 years.
Amortisation is charged to the profit and loss account from the beginning of the month following acquisition.
e Tangible fixed assets Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of fixed assets in equal monthly instalments over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2% p. a.
Short leasehold buildings Length of lease Fixtures and fittings 10% to 15% p. a.
Plant and machinery 10% to 15% p. a.
Motor vehicles 25% p. a. Freehold land is not depreciated.
f Impairment of tangible fixed assets and goodwill For acquired goodwill an impairment review is carried out at the end of the first full year following an acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of the asset against the higher of net realisable value or value in use.
The value in use is determined from estimated discounted future cash flows.
Discount rates are based on the circumstances of the individual businesses.
g Disposal of land and buildings Profit and losses on disposal of land and buildings represent the difference between the net proceeds and the net carrying value at the date of sale.
Sales are accounted for when there is an unconditional exchange of contracts or when the completion cannot be unreasonably withheld.
h Stock Stock is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
i Rebates receivable from suppliers Volume related rebates receivable from suppliers are credited to the carrying value of the stock to which they relate.
Where a rebate agreement with a supplier covers more than one year the rebates are recognised in the period to which they relate.
j Deferred taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the period and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS19.
k Leased assets Assets financed by leasing agreements that give rights approximating to ownership are treated as finance leases and included in tangible fixed assets and depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the period of the lease.
Rentals are apportioned between reductions in the capital obligations included in creditors and those amounts relating to finance charges, which are charged to the profit and loss account at a constant periodic rate of charge.
All operating lease rentals are written off to the profit and loss account in equal monthly instalments over the term of the lease.
Income under operating leases is credited to the profit and loss account when receivable.
l Pensions The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
The cost of providing pension benefits is spread over the expected working lives of pension scheme members.
The Company and certain subsidiaries also operate defined contribution schemes, contributions to which are charged against profits as they become payable.
m Employee Share schemes The cost of administration of the All Employee Share Ownership Plan is borne by the Company.
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2005 38 1 Principal accounting policies continued n Accounting for new stores Benefits received as incentives to sign leases, in the form of reverse premiums, are spread on a straight line basis over the period to the first rent review.
Pre-opening costs are expensed to the profit and loss account as incurred.
o Foreign currency The profit and loss account and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period and the balance sheet at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net assets and exchange differences between the results translated at an average rate and a closing rate are dealt with through reserves.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings used to finance or provide a hedge against equity investments in foreign enterprises are taken to reserves and disclosed in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
p Cash and liquid resources Cash for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts repayable on demand.
Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are either readily convertible into known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying values or traded in an active market.
q Investments Fixed asset and current asset investments are included in the balance sheet at cost, less any provisions for impairment.
r Financial investments Financial assets are recognised on the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Discounts and premiums are charged or credited to the profit and loss account over the life of the asset or liability to which they relate.
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for using hedge accounting to the extent that they are held to hedge a financial asset or liability.
When a financial instrument ceases to be a hedge, either as a result of the underlying asset or liability being extinguished, or because a future event is no longer likely to occur, the instrument will thereafter be marked to its fair value and any loss accounted for in the financial instruments.
Termination payments made or received in respect of derivatives are spread over the life of the underlying exposure in cases where the underlying exposure continues to exist and taken to the profit and loss account when the underlying exposure ceases to exist.
Outstanding contracts used to hedge against trading items which themselves will be accounted for in the profits or losses of a future period are not recognised, or are deferred when they mature, and are carried forward against corresponding gains and losses when they occur.
Income and expenditure arising on financial instruments held for hedging purposes is recognised on an accrual basis, and credited or charged to the profit and loss account in the financial period in which it arises.

10 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust see Note 19 which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potential dilutive Ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of potential dilutive Ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long term incentive plan.

In accordance with the practice adopted by most major retailers, the Directors have amended the definition of underlying earnings from that disclosed in the annual report 2004, as they believe this provides a more comparable measure on an ongoing basis.
Underlying earnings is defined as profit after allowing for, when relevant, goodwill amortisation, profit on disposal and termination and non operating tax adjustments.
The figures for 2004 have been restated to be comparable.

24 Pensions costs a Defined benefit scheme The UK Company operates a funded pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company, being invested in a Managed Fund operated by the Clerical Medical Investment Group.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent actuarial review was at 6 April 2002 when the market value of the fund was 4,270,384 excluding the value of any Additional Voluntary Contributions and at which date the actuarial value of the assets represented 88% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The assumptions which had the most significant effect on the results of the valuation were a rate of investment return of 6.5% and salary increases of 4% p. a.
Since the date of the formal valuation there have been regular updates of the schemes funding position.
Changes in market conditions have led to a deterioration in the funding position of the scheme.
Consequently, on 1 April 2004 the Company increased contributions into the pension fund to 19.6% of earnings, from 18% the previous year.
The employee contributions remained unchanged at 5% of earnings.
The pension charge to the profit and loss account for the current year was 550,822 2004: 490,664.
Contributions totalling 56,065 2004: 55,458 are included in creditors and have been paid to the fund since the year end.
b FRS17 Retirement benefits disclosures Whilst the Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension costs the following transitional disclosures are required under FRS17 Retirement benefits: The actuarial valuation was updated to 30 April 2005 by a qualified actuary, on a FRS17 basis, and is reported below.
The major assumptions used for this update were: 30 April 2005 1 May 2004 3 May 2003 % %% Rate of increase in salaries 3.50 3.25 2.75 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 2.75 2.50 2.00 Discount rate 5.25 5.50 5.25 Inflation assumption 2.75 2.50 2.00 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

It is not possible to identify Carpetrights share in the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis.
In accordance with FRS17, Carpetright has taken the exemption for multi-employer pension schemes not to disclose scheme assets and liabilities.
Accordingly, this scheme has been treated as a defined contribution scheme recognising the contributions payable each year.

Contributions are made by the employees which, up to an upper limit, are matched by the Company.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company and are invested by the National Provident Institution.

Contributions totalling 90,915 2004: 87,986 are included in creditors and have been paid to the scheme since the year end.
In addition, the Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for subsidiary companies in Belgium, The Netherlands and the UK.
