Barclays PLC 264 Annual Report 2005 63 Differences between IFRS and US GAAP accounting principles continued For those standards that were not adopted until 1st January 2005, UK GAAP continued to be applied throughout 2004 in accordance with IFRS transition rules.
Therefore, for 31st December 2004, the differences relating to Derivatives, Fair value of securities, Loan origination and Extinguishment of liabilities are the same as those previously reported and have been provided on page 267.

Certain terms and conditions of hybrid contracts which themselves would be standalone derivatives are bifurcated from the underlying hybrid contract and fair valued if they are not clearly and closely related to the contract in which they are contained.
These are referred to as embedded derivatives.
Fair value of securities Positions in investment debt securities and investment equity shares are Under SFAS 115, debt and marketable equity securities are classified stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
The cost of dated as one of three types.
Trading securities are carried at fair value with investment securities is adjusted for the amortisation of premiums changes in fair value taken through profit and loss: held to maturity or discount on purchase over the period to redemption.

Declines in fair value below cost that are deemed other-than-temporary impairment are recognised on the held to maturity and available for sale categories and are reflected in the profit and loss account.
Non-marketable securities held by investment companies are carried at fair value with movements in fair value recorded in net income.
Loan origination Fee income relating to the origination of loans is recognised in the profit SFAS 91 requires loan origination fees and incremental direct costs of and loss account to match the cost over the period in which the service loan origination to be deferred and amortised over the life of the loan as is provided, together with a reasonable profit margin.

Barclays PLC Annual Report 2005 265 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31st December 2005 Applicable developments in US GAAP SOP 03-03: Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer The Statement of Position 03-03 SOP 03-03 addresses accounting for differences between the contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investors initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable to credit quality.
The Group adopted this SOP from 1st January 2005 and has applied it to its acquisitions during the financial year.

SFAS 123-R: Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123 R SFAS 123-R was issued on 16th December 2004.
SFAS 123-R requires that companies expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation.
The statement requires that companies use fair value to measure stock-based compensation awards and cease using the intrinsic value method of accounting, which was allowed by APB 25.
To account as an award under SFAS 123-R the terms of the awards have to include at least one of the following three conditions: market condition, performance condition and service condition.
The type of condition used in the award governs how the award will be measured.
The statement applies as of the beginning of the fiscal year starting after 15th June 2005.
Barclays is assessing the impact of the statement on the Groups US GAAP position.
SFAS 154: Accounting Changes and Error Corrections Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No 154 SFAS 154 issued in May 2005 replaces APB 20 and SFAS 3 and changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle.
This statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and requires the retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of such changes.
SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortisation or depletion method for long-lived non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle.
SFAS 154 carries forward without change the guidance in Opinion 20 for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements.
The statement is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after 15th December 2005.
FIN 47: Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations FASB Interpretation No.
47 FIN 47 was issued in March 2005 and clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation.
FIN 47 requires that an entity should recognise a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated.
This interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after 15th December 2005.
SFAS 155: Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.
155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments SFAS 155, an amendment of SFAS 140 and SFAS 133.
SFAS 155 permits election to measure any hybrid financial instrument at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in earnings if the hybrid instruments contains an embedded derivative that would otherwise be required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately under SFAS 133.
The election to measure the hybrid instrument at fair value is made on an  basis and is irreversible.
The Statement will be effective for all instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a remeasurement event occuring after the beginning of fiscal years that begin after 15th September 2006, with earlier adoption permitted as of the beginning of the Groups 2006 fiscal year, provided that financial statements for any interim period of that fiscal year have not been issued.
The Group has decided it will early adopt SFAS 155 effective from 1st January 2006 and is assessing the impact of this change in accounting.

The significant differences for each segment under US GAAP are in respect of netting adjustments as disclosed in Note 63 o, and the securitisation adjustment as disclosed in Note 63 l. The impact of these adjustments is to decrease the total assets of Barclays Capital by 96,741m 2004: increase by 45,257m, increase the total assets of Barclays Global Investors by 9,669m 2004: 68,354m, decrease the total assets of Barclaycard by 6,390m 2004: 3,122m.
Note a In 2004, the US GAAP cash and cash equivalents figure was included in cash and balances at central banks.
In 2005, cash and cash equivalents has been classified in its component lines as required by IFRS.
Barclays PLC 268 Annual Report 2005 63 Differences between IFRS and US GAAP accounting principles continued a Goodwill The Group annually reviews the carrying value of its goodwill based on expected future earnings.
In 2005, there was no impairment to goodwill under US GAAP.
In 2004, goodwill recorded by the Group under US GAAP included amounts related to interests acquired following the restructuring of businesses to which the Group had previously advanced funds.
The Group identified an excess in the carrying value of the reporting units over their implied fair value and recorded an impairment charge of 56m.
The impairment was based on revised cash flow projections which were lower than forecasted due to going concern issues within these businesses.
Further, a partial write down of 12m was recorded in 2004 in relation to a Group entity acquired prior to 1st January 1998 in respect of which the goodwill had been previously written off to reserves under UK GAAP.
The impairment was due to achieved cash flows being lower than those required to support the carrying value of goodwill.
The current carrying value of goodwill for US GAAP purposes has been allocated to the reportable business clusters of the Group: Reallocation At beginning between Exchange of year clusters Additions and other 2005 m m m m m UK Banking 2,760 14 1 2,775 Wealth Management 548 548 International Retail and Commercial Banking 448 1,253 63 1,764 Barclaycard 336 24 12 372 Barclays Capital 42 16 26 Barclays Global Investors 116 6 139 9 258 Head office functions and other operations 10 8 18 Goodwill 4,260 1,417 84 5,761 b Intangible assets Core Licences deposit Customer and other Other intangible Brand lists contracts software 2005 m m m m m m Cost or valuation At beginning of year 513 33 313 57 12 928 Acquisitions disposals as a result of business combinations 186 110 338 2 17 653 Additions 8 76 3 87 Fully amortised assets written off 25 25 Exchange other 7 3 33 2 45 Cost carried forward 706 121 692 137 32 1,688 Accumulated amortisation and impairment At beginning of year 284 29 129 6 4 452 Amortisation charge for year 80 7 58 9 6 160 Impairment charge 1 1 Fully amortised assets written off 25 25 Exchange other 5 2 5 1 1 Amortisation carried forward 359 9 192 17 10 587 Net book value 2005 347 112 500 120 22 1,101 Weighted average amortisation period for additions months 334 127 332 78 36 The amortisation expense for the net carrying amount of intangible assets is estimated to be 187m in 2006, 139m in 2007, 91m in 2008, 73m in 2009 and 59m in 2010.
In addition to the acquired intangible assets shown in the table above a core deposit intangible asset with a net book value of 6m is recognised in relation to the Groups equity investment in FirstCaribbean International Bank.
As the amortisation of intangible assets is a deductible expense for income tax purposes, US GAAP requires the recognition of a tax amortisation 3.5 benefit.
The tax amortisation benefit is taken to income over an appropriate life.
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2005 269 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31st December 2005 63 Differences between IFRS and US GAAP accounting principles continued c Pensions and post-retirement benefits Upon transition to IFRS, all schemes held by the Group have been reassessed and, consequently, the following schemes are deemed material for US GAAP purposes: the UK Retirement Fund UKRF, Barclays Capital Retirement Plan and Barclays Capital Restoration Plan Barclays Capital schemes.
Together these schemes make up approximately 95% of all the Groups schemes in terms of assets and actuarial liabilities.
In 2004, the pension scheme assessed under US GAAP was the UKRF which is composed of the 1964 Pension Scheme, Retirement Investment Scheme, Pension Investment Plan, afterwork and the Career Average Section.
The provisions of US GAAP have been applied to the UKRF based on a measurement date of 30th September, and to the remaining schemes based on a measurement date of 31st December.
Consequently, the 250m contribution made to the UKRF in December 2004 is included in the US GAAP analysis of the assets and the 350m contribution made to the UKRF in December 2005 is excluded from the US GAAP analysis of plan assets.
Under the terms of an agreement between the Bank, the Trustees of the Woolwich Pension Fund WPF and the Trustees of the UKRF, the final transfer of the liabilities of the WPF into the UKRF was made on 1st May 2004, following which the remaining 56.2m assets in the WPF were transferred to the UKRF and a special contribution of 2m was paid into the UKRF.
The components of the pension and post-retirements expense where an actuarial basis is appropriate which arise under US GAAP are as follows: 2005 2004 PostPostretirement retirement Pensions benefits Pensions benefits m m m m Components of net periodic benefit cost Service cost 361 2 319 1 Interest cost 808 6 692 5 Expected return on plan assets 818 738 Amortisation of transition adjustment 1 Termination benefits 51 Recognised net actuarial loss 40 2 27 2 Net periodic benefit cost 442 11 300 8 For measurement purposes, the calculation assumes an 11% and 5% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benefits and dental benefits respectively for pensioners in the US at the end of the 2005 year 10.6% and 5% at the end of 2004.

This recognises that different asset classes are likely to produce different long-term returns, and some asset classes will be more volatile than others.
One of the factors in the choice of a long-term strategy is to ensure that the investments are adequately diversified.
The managers are permitted some flexibility to vary the asset allocation from the long-term strategy within control ranges agreed with the Trustee from time to time.

The additional pensions cost compared to IFRS of 202m 2004: 14m includes an 8m credit 2004: 8m relating to amortisation of an additional fair value adjustment under US GAAP.
This is being amortised over the expected life of the relevant pension liability.

Where the securities are held by an investment company within the Group, the securities are carried at fair value.
All investment securities are classified as being available for sale unless the Group has a clear intention and ability to hold them to maturity.
Other securities are classified as trading securities.
The following table shows the gross unrealised losses and fair value for available for sale and held-to-maturity securities, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealised loss position at 31st December 2005.

This review considers factors such as the duration and amount at which fair value is below cost, the credit standing and prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Group to hold the security for such sufficient time to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
Under US GAAP, 177 available for sale and held-to-maturity debt securities had unrealised losses as at 31st December 2005.
Based on a review performed at 31st December 2005, management believes that the unrealised losses are temporary in nature.
The unrealised losses are due to market movements in interest rates.
The credit quality of the bond issuers remains strong with 100% rated as investment grade or higher and the Group has the ability and intent to hold these positions until recovery.

g Loan impairment and disclosure SFAS 114 applies only to impaired loans, the measurement of which is based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, the loans observable market value, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
Smaller balance homogeneous consumer loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment are outside the scope of SFAS 114, as are debt securities and leases.
At 31st December 2005, the element of impaired loans outside the scope of SFAS 114 amounted to 3,336m 2004: 2,599m.
In accordance with SFAS 114, the Groups total impaired loans being non-performing, less impaired loans outside the scope of SFAS 114, amount to 1,874m at 31st December 2005 2004: 1,386m.
Credit risk provisions of 935m, estimated in accordance with SFAS 114, were held against these loans 2004: 721m.
The average level of such impaired lendings in 2005 was 1,661m 2004: 1,736m.
Where cash received represents the realisation of security, or there is doubt regarding the recovery of a loan, such receipts are treated as repayments of the loan principal.
Otherwise, cash received in respect of impaired loans is recognised as interest income.
Estimated interest income which was recognised in 2005 on impaired loans within the scope of SFAS 114 was 13m 2004: 24m.
SFAS 114 modifies the accounting for in-substance foreclosure, in that collateralised debts where the Group takes physical possession of the collateral, regardless of formal insolvency procedures, would be reclassified as if the collateral had been acquired for cash.
At 31st December 2005, under US GAAP, the amount of collateral recorded at the lower of the book value of the debt or the fair value of the collateral that would be reclassified as other real estate owned was nil 2004: 7m and as debt and equity instruments was 57m 2004: 34m.
During 2005, there were no mortgage loans held which were held with the intention of resale.
In 2004, mortgage loans of 3,482m were included within loans and advances to customers which were held with the intention of resale.
During 2004, 4,762m of loans were sold generating a net profit of 31m.
Barclays PLC 274 Annual Report 2005 63 Differences between IFRS and US GAAP accounting principles continued h Business combination In 2002, Barclays and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce completed the combination of their retail, corporate and offshore banking operations and created FirstCaribbean International Bank.
Under both IFRS and US GAAP, Barclays accounts for the resulting interest as an associate.
At the time of the transaction, a gain of 206m was generated under both UK and US GAAP, the gain being recorded in equity for UK GAAP but in the income statement under US GAAP APB 29 and EITF 01-02.
The net assets of the business transferred by Barclays to the new entity were not materially different under US GAAP.
In 2004, an adjustment of 13m was made to the gain of 206m, which was also recorded in the income statement under US GAAP.
i Foreign exchange differences on available for sale AFS debt securities Under IFRS the translation of foreign currency denominated AFS debt securities into the functional currency of the legal entity in which they are held is recognised directly in the income statement.
For US GAAP these movements are reported in shareholders equity.
The pre-tax credit of 185m 2004: 428m represents the reclassification of this amount from the income statement into shareholders equity for US GAAP.
j Hedging The US GAAP hedging adjustment results in a decrease in income of 208m.
Of this, 69m relates to the reversal of IFRS transition adjustments and the inclusion of SFAS 133 transition adjustments and 139m relates to ongoing hedging differences.
k Consolidation Under US GAAP, the differences in the consolidation criteria to IFRS results in an increase in total assets of 4,268m 2004: decrease of 3,571m.
Under US GAAP, the Group consolidates entities in which it has a controlling financial interest.
This is determined by initially evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity, a variable interest entity VIE, or a qualifying special purpose entity QSPE.
Voting interest entities Voting interest entities are entities in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable each entity to finance itself independently and provides the equity holders with the obligation to absorb losses, the rights to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entitys activities.
Voting interest entities are consolidated in accordance with ARB 51 which states that the usual condition for a controlling financial interest in an entity is ownership of a majority voting interest.
Variable interest entities As defined in FIN 46-R, an entity is considered a VIE subject to consolidation if the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or if the equity investors lack one of three characteristics of a controlling financial interest described above.
First, the equity investors lack the ability to make decisions about the entitys activities through voting rights or similar rights.
Second, they do not bear the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur.
Lastly, they do not claim the right to receive expected returns of the entity if they occur, which are the compensation for the risk of absorbing the expected losses.
VIEs are consolidated by the interest holder that remains exposed to the majority of the entitys expected losses or residual returns, that is, the primary beneficiary.
The business activities within the Barclays Group where VIEs are used include multi-seller conduit programmes, asset securitisations, client intermediation, credit structuring, asset realisations and fund management.
Multi-seller conduit programmes Barclays creates, administers and provides liquidity and credit enhancements to several commercial paper conduit programmes, primarily in the United States.
These conduits provide clients access to liquidity in the commercial paper markets by allowing them to sell consumer or trade receivables to the conduit, which then issues commercial paper to investors to fund the purchase.
The conduits have sufficient collateral, credit enhancements and liquidity support to maintain an investment grade rating for the commercial paper.
Asset securitisations The Group assists companies with the formation of asset securitisations.
These entities have minimal equity and rely upon funding in the form of notes to purchase the assets for securitisation.
The Group provides both senior and or junior lending and derivative contracts to the entities, where junior notes are provided and in certain circumstances where derivative contracts are provided, the Group may be the primary beneficiary of the entity.
3.5 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2005 275 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31st December 2005 63 Differences between IFRS and US GAAP accounting principles continued k Consolidation continued Client intermediation As a financial intermediary, the Group is involved in structuring transactions to meet investor and client needs.
These transactions may involve entities that fall within the scope of FIN 46-R structured by either Barclays or the client and that are used to modify cash flows of third-party assets to create investments with specific risk or return profiles, or to assist clients in the efficient management of other risks.
These transactions may include derivative instruments, and often contain contractual clauses to enable Barclays to terminate the transaction under certain circumstances, for example, if the legal or accounting basis on which the transaction was completed changes.
In addition, Barclays invests as a limited partner in lessor partnerships and as a parent in wholly owned subsidiaries specifically to acquire assets for leasing.
In a portion of these leasing transactions, there may be risk mitigants in place which result in a third-party consolidating the entities as the primary beneficiary.
Credit structuring The Group structures investments to provide specific risk profiles to investors.
This may involve the sale of credit exposures, often by way of credit derivatives, to an entity which subsequently funds the credit exposures by issuing securities.
These securities may initially be held by Barclays prior to sale outside of the Group.
Asset realisations The Group establishes SPEs to facilitate the recovery of loans in circumstances where the borrower has suffered financial loss.
Fund management The Group provides asset management services to a large number of investment entities on an arms-length basis and at market terms and prices.
The majority of these entities are investment funds that are owned by a large and diversified number of investors.
In addition, there are various partnerships, funds and open-ended investment companies that are used by a limited number of independent third parties to facilitate their tailored private debt, debt securities or hedge fund investment strategies.
The Group is the primary beneficiary in the following VIEs, classified by type of activity: 2005 2004 Total assets Total assets Activity m m Asset securitisations 13,750 3,926 Multi-seller conduit programmes 17,260 12,404 Client intermediation 4,451 216 Credit structuring 641 2,343 Asset realisations 49 68 The creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the Group in respect of the variable interest entities consolidated by the Group.

QSPEs are passive entities used by the Group to hold financial assets transferred to them by the Group and are commonly used in mortgage and other securitisation transactions as described in Note 63 l below.
Note a The maximum exposure to loss represents a worst case scenario in the event that all such entities simultaneously fail.
It does not provide an indication of ongoing exposure which is managed within the Groups risk management framework.
Where a maximum exposure to loss is quoted, this represents the Groups total exposure and includes both drawn and undrawn lending facilities.
The Groups exposure is determined by changes in the value of the variable interests it holds within these entities, which primarily comprise liquidity, credit enhancements, derivative transactions and financing arrangements.
Barclays PLC 276 Annual Report 2005 63 Differences between IFRS and US GAAP accounting principles continued l Securitisations Credit card securitisations The Group transfers portfolios of credit card receivable assets to Gracechurch Receivables Trustee Limited.
Barclaycard Funding PLC, a subsidiary of Barclays Bank, has an equitable interest in the cash flows arising from the securitised assets and has issued Loan Note Certificates to the Gracechurch Card Funding vehicles which are Qualifying Special Purpose Entities QSPEs.
QSPEs sell the Medium Term Notes to investors entitling them to receive specified cash flows during the life of the security.
The proceeds of the issuance of Medium Term Notes are then distributed by the QSPEs to the Group as consideration for the Loan Note Certificates transferred.
Following a securitisation, the Group receives fees for servicing the receivables and providing cash management services and payment of deferred consideration for the sale of the beneficial interest in the excess income over and above the interest paid to the noteholder.
The Group maintains an interest in the pool of receivables that are available for securitisation, referred to as the sellers interest.
Investors have no recourse against the Group if cash flows generated from the securitised assets are not sufficient to service the obligations of the QSPEs.
The Group has no right or obligation to repurchase the benefit of any securitised balance, except if certain representations and warranties given by the Group at the time of transfer are breached.
The Group has entered into interest rate currency swaps with the QSPEs.
These swaps convert a proportion of the Sterling variable interest flows arising from the Loan Note Certificates to US Dollar variable and fixed rate interest flows to match the interest payable on the Medium Term Notes issued.
The transfer of receivables is accounted for as a sale under US GAAP where control of the receivables has been relinquished.
A gain or loss is recognised on securitisation of the receivables which is calculated based on the previous carrying amount of the loans involved in the transfer allocated between the receivables sold and the sellers interest based on their relative fair values at the date of sale.
The Group estimates the fair value of the retained interests by determining the present value of future expected cash flows using valuation models that incorporate managements best estimates of key assumptions, which include: a the expected prepayment rate of the receivables each year: b the anticipated credit losses from the receivables: and c a discount rate to calculate future income flows.
The retained interests that are subject to prepayment risk such that the Group may not recover substantially all of its investment are recorded at fair value with subsequent adjustments reflected in net income.
The servicing liability represents the shortfall of future servicing income from the Groups obligation to service the transferred assets compared to the costs of servicing those assets.
The servicing liability is amortised over the expected life of the receivables.
Securitisation activity during the year During 2005, the Group securitised credit card receivables with a book value of 3,497m 2004: 810m recognising a resultant pre-tax gain on sale under US GAAP of 174m 2004: 38m.
The Group has recognised an interest only strip asset and a servicing liability in connection with the transfer.
The derecognition of the securitised assets results in a reduction in net loans and advances to customers of 6,648m 2004: 3,270m.
Mortgage Loans Securitisation In 2004, Barclays acquired and then securitised ten static pools of residential mortgage loans which were originated by unaffiliated mortgage companies.
Certain of these securitisations were affected through the sale of mortgage loans to QSPEs.
During 2005, Barclays acquired and then securitised an additional ten pools of residential mortgage loans: however, these securitisations did not qualify for sale accounting and are treated as financing transactions.
To fund the acquisition of these mortgage loans, the trust issued Floating Rate Notes FRNs.
The FRNs were underwritten by Barclays and sold to third party investors.
The offering circulars for the issues of FRNs stated that they are the obligations of the respective trust only and are not guaranteed by, or the responsibility of, any other party.
A call right is held by the originator with the right to liquidate the trust if the principal balance of the mortgage shares has fallen below 10% of their initial amount, provided all obligations under the bonds can be satisfied in full.
Securitisation activity during the year During 2005, no securitisations qualified for sale accounting, and therefore non-returnable proceeds of these securitisations totalled nil at issue 2004: 4,538m and a net gain of nil arising from the transfer of these assets to the QSPEs 2004: 25m was recognised.

During 2004, no servicing assets or liabilities arose on the securitisation of the mortgages, as the originator had retained the right to service these assets.

However, changes in fair value based on a variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear.
Furthermore, the sensitivities for each key variable are calculated independently of changes in the other key variables.

Barclays PLC Annual Report 2005 279 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31st December 2005 63 Differences between IFRS and US GAAP accounting principles continued m Guarantees An element of Barclays normal banking business is to issue guarantees on behalf of its customers.
In almost all cases, Barclays will hold collateral against the exposure, have a right of recourse to the customer or both.
In addition, Barclays issues guarantees on its own behalf.
The major categories of these guarantees are: Financial guarantees These are given to banks and financial institutions on behalf of customers to secure loans, overdrafts and other banking facilities.
These are commonly called facility guarantees.
Included within this category are stock borrowing indemnities.
These relate to funds managed by Barclays on behalf of clients, which participate in stock lending programmes.
Barclays indemnifies the clients against any losses incurred by the clients resulting from borrower default.
Collateral, principally cash, is maintained against all stock borrowing transactions ranging from 102% to 105% of the securities loaned with adjustments to collateral made daily.
It is possible that the exposure could exceed the collateral provided should the value of the security rise concurrently with the default of the borrowers.
Standby letters of credit These are irrevocable commitments to pay a third party, on behalf of our customers, the value of which on demand is subject to certain criteria being complied with.
Any amounts paid are debited to the customers accounts.
These contracts are used when required in substitution of guarantees due to a greater acceptability in the beneficiary country.
Other guarantees This category includes the following types of contracts: Performance guarantees a guarantee given by the Bank on behalf of a customer, undertaking to pay a certain sum if our customer has failed to carry out the terms or certain terms of the contract.
Advance payment guarantees enables the beneficiary to demand repayment of an advance in funds in certain circumstances.
Tender guarantees provided during a tender process to lend support to a customers commitment to a tender process.
Customs and Excise guarantees provided to HM Revenue and Customs to cover a customers liability, most commonly for import duties.
Retention guarantees similar to advance payments but are used to secure early release of retained contract payments.
The following table provides the maturity analysis of guarantees issued by the Group.
The amounts disclosed represent the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted the Group could be required to make under the guarantee, before any recovery through recourse or collaterisation provisions.

The maximum liability that Barclays could have is the total credit limits marked to customers of 54,479m 2004: 42,813m.
These limits are included within commitments with a maturity of less than one year, as the limit can be revoked at any time.
Warranties and indemnities given as part of acquisition and disposal activity Warranties and indemnities are routinely provided to counterparties as part of the terms and conditions required in a business acquisition, disposal or investing in joint ventures.
Most commonly, these relate to indemnification against tax liabilities arising from pre-transaction activities.
Usually the total aggregate liability, in respect of warranties and indemnities for a transaction is capped and the maximum exposure under these is 2,139m 2004: 2,686m.
No collateral or recourse to third parties is generally available.
Certain derivative contracts In addition to the contracts described above, there are certain derivative contracts to which the Group is a counterparty that meet the characteristics of a guarantee under FIN 45.
These derivatives are recorded in the Groups balance sheet at fair value under US GAAP.

These products are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 97, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities associated with these products are recorded on the balance sheet.
From 1st January 2005, these assets and liabilities are stated gross on the balance sheet under both IFRS and US GAAP.
The inclusion of acceptances resulted in an increase in total assets under US GAAP of 253m 2004: 263m.

Assuming that the acquisition of Absa occurred on 1st January 2005 for 2004 on 1st January 2004 the Group would have reported total income excluding impairment charge and other credit provisions under US GAAP of 18,618m 2004: 14,857m, profit before tax of 4,789m 2004: 4,648m, net profit for the year of 3,059m 2004: 3,127m and basic earnings per share of 48.3p 2004: 49.0p.
These combined pro forma figures have not been audited.
With regard to other acquisitions in 2005, no significant differences between IFRS and US GAAP have been identified.
SOP 03-03 addresses accounting for differences between the contractual cash flows and expected cash flows of the loans and debt securities acquired if those differences are attributable at least in part to a deterioration in credit risk since origination.
During the acquisition of Absa 205m of loans were acquired which fall within the scope of SOP 03-03.
The basis of their recognition within the Group balance sheet was at the present value of expected future cash flows.
For loans acquired, the yield at acquisition was 19m and the carrying value at the end of the year was 130m with an associated 5m charge through the income statement for impairment.
No available for sale debt securities fell within the scope of SOP 03-03.
