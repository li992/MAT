Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, modied by the revaluation of certain properties, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
True and fair override provisions of the Companies Act 1985 have been invoked, as described in goodwill below and note 11.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and each of its subsidiary undertakings made up to 2 July 2005.
Entities in which the group holds an interest on a long-term basis and are jointly controlled by the group and one or more other ventures under a contractual arrangement are treated as joint ventures.
In the group financial statements, joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
Accounting for debt issue costs Debt issue costs are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of the relevant debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the debt issue costs charged to the profit and loss account in respect of the accounting period.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the group, and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over their useful lives.
The capital elements of future obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the profit and loss account over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Operating lease incentives The group recognises the aggregate effect of operating lease incentives as an element of rental expense.
The value of the incentives is included within accruals and deferred income and is allocated on a straight line basis over the shorter of the period to the first rent review or the life of the lease.
Financial instruments The group uses energy derivatives to hedge fuel price exposures.
The group considers these instruments qualify for hedge accounting and are not revalued to fair value or shown on the group balance sheet.
Treasury shares The group has purchased some of its own shares during the year which remain uncancelled.
The consideration paid for the groups own shares has been recognised as a deduction from shareholders funds as a separate reservereserve for own shares.
Insurance The group limits its exposure to the cost of motor, employer and public liability claims through third party insurance policies.
These provide individual claim cover, subject to high excess limits and an annual aggregate stop loss for total claims within the excess limits.
An accrual is made within Creditors: amounts falling due within one year for the estimated cost to the group to settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date, subject to the overall stop loss.
The estimation of the balance sheet uninsured claims accrual is made after taking appropriate professional advice and is based on an assessment of the expected settlement on known claims, together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date but that have not yet been reported to the group.
Fixed assets and depreciation Land is not depreciated.
The cost or valuation of other tangible assets including assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts is depreciated evenly over the expected useful lives of the assets as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold property 50 years Short leasehold property The remainder of the lease Rolling stock 8 to 15 years Plant and equipment 3 to 15 years The transitional arrangements of FRS 15 have been adopted for group properties, which permit the previous revaluation, performed as at 27 June 1998, to be retained.
Other xed assets are shown at historical cost to the group.
Heavy maintenance costs of assets held under operating lease are capitalised where the conditions of the lease provide that these costs are borne by the lessee.
These costs are depreciated evenly over the period to the next expected date for heavy maintenance.
Goodwill For acquisitions prior to 27 June 1998, goodwill arising on acquisitions was set off directly against reserves.
Goodwill previously eliminated against reserves has not been reinstated on implementation of FRS 10.
In the event of subsequent disposal of the business to which it related, goodwill will be charged or credited to the profit and loss account.
Positive goodwill arising on acquisitions since 28 June 1998 is capitalised and carried as an asset on the balance sheet.
Fair 32 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 2 July 2005 value accounting adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions, some adjustments are made using provisional estimates, based on information available, and amendments are sometimes necessary in the following period, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.
Each acquisition is assessed individually to determine if the estimated useful life of the goodwill is considered to be indefinite.
No amortisation is provided where the board is of the opinion that to do so would not show a true and fair view of the profit for the year or the financial position of the group at the end of the year.
This overrides the requirement of the Companies Act 1985 to amortise goodwill but it is in compliance with FRS 10.
Where the useful life is not considered indefinite, the goodwill is amortised to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life up to a maximum of 20 years.
In either case, goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition.
Where goodwill is not amortised, an annual impairment review is performed.
An impairment review is also carried out on goodwill being amortised if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Franchise bid costs A key part of the groups activities is the process of bidding for and securing franchises to operate rail services in the UK.
All franchise bid costs incurred prior to achieving preferred bidder status are treated as an expense irrespective of the ultimate outcome of the bid.
Directly attributable incremental third party costs incurred after achieving preferred bidder status are capitalised.
Capitalised franchise bid costs are classied as an intangible asset which is amortised on a straight line basis over the expected period of the franchise in question.
The carrying value of such assets are reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the award of the franchise and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Stocks Stocks of fuel and engineering spares are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences which have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Except where otherwise required by accounting standards, no timing differences are recognised in respect of: property revaluation surpluses where there is no commitment to sell the asset: gains on sale of assets where those gains have been rolled over into replacement assets: deferred tax assets except to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the enacted rates at which it is estimated the tax will be payable.
The deferred tax provision is not discounted to net present value.
Pension benets The group operates retirement benefit schemes, both dened benefit and dened contribution.
In respect of the dened benefit schemes, the pension benets are funded over the employees average period of service.
The net pension cost to the company as determined from the latest triennial actuarial valuation and subsequent actuarial reviews is charged to the profit and loss account, in accordance with SSAP 24.
Contributions payable under the money purchase schemes are charged to the profit and loss account as they arise.

The goodwill additions in the year arose on the acquisition of the remaining 50% share of Plane Handling Limited on 31 August 2004 and the acquisition of Southern Vectis PLC on 20 June 2005.
Southern holds a franchise agreement with the SRA to operate commuter rail services on the Southern Network.
This is expected to expire in December 2009 and goodwill is being amortised over the period from acquisition, in 2002, to this date.
A review has been performed which confirmed that there has been no impairment to the remaining goodwill during the financial year.
The useful economic life of the remaining goodwill in respect of the aviation division, as a whole, including Plane Handling, Chauffeured Parking Services and Meteor Parking, is regarded as indefinite as, despite short term difficulties in certain areas, the long-term growth rates for the aviation services industry is still forecast by industry analysts to be high.
Each business remains in a very strong position to take maximum and sustained advantage of this growing market due to their presence at nearly all major UK airports and their reputation, expertise, customer base and strategy.
This position provides competitive advantage, which combined with continuing barriers to entry to potential future competitors, provides a basis for durable value and sustainable long-term returns.
Metrobus operates bus services in the outer London area, generating revenue from both London Transport contracts and non-regulatory areas.
Patronage in the London areas has shown a marked increase over recent years, and with growing congestion in the capital, this is predicted to continue.
Wilts & Dorset and Southern Vectis operate bus services in the Poole, Bournemouth, Salisbury, Southampton and the Isle of Wight district generating revenues from fare paying passengers and contracts.
Demographic growth and increasing trafc congestion in these areas serves to give a positive outlook for future revenues.
Metrobus, Wilts & Dorset and Southern Vectis have the necessary skills and resources to exploit these opportunities leading the board to its conclusion that the useful life of the remaining goodwill exceeds 20 years and is indefinite.
Accordingly the board is of the opinion that amortisation of the goodwill of Plane Handling, Meteor Parking, Chauffeured Parking Services, Metrobus, Wilts & Dorset and Southern Vectis would not show a true and fair view.
Had the goodwill been amortised in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 over the FRS 10 rebutable assumption period of 20 years, an additional 2.3m would have been charged to the profit and loss account in the year to 2 July 2005 2004 1.5m.

The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 2 July 2005 45 Notes to the financial statements continued 22 Operating lease commitments The groups rail franchises hold agreements under which they lease rolling stock, and agreements with Network Rail for access to the railway infrastructure track, stations and depots.
Annual commitments under these operating leases which expire: 2005 2004 m m Within one year 31.3 16.0 In the second to fifth years inclusive 180.0 39.0 Over five years 130.7 211.3 185.7 Annual rentals under other operating leases which expire: 2005 2004 Property Other Property Other m m m m Group Within one year 4.5 1.4 5.1 1.7 In the second to fifth years inclusive 2.8 17.4 0.7 16.4 Over five years 6.6 0.4 1.3 0.3 13.9 19.2 7.1 18.4 Company Within one year In the second to fifth years inclusive Over five years 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 23 Derivatives and financial instruments The groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, finance leases, hire purchase contracts, cash and shortterm deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide working capital and investment funds for xed assets and acquisitions.
The group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations, and it hedges its risk to increases in fuel prices using energy derivatives.
The main risk arising from the groups financial instruments is changes in interest rates.
The boards policy toward cash deposits is to deposit cash short term on UK money markets.
Interest payable on bank borrowings is based on re-xing the rate of interest over short periods of time of up to six months.
Excluding xed rate debt, the group has net deposits and hence the present adverse risk is a decrease in interest rates.
During the year the group replaced its 70m syndicated facility, with bilateral arrangements, totalling 120m.
This has had the effect of increasing exibility and improved management of interest rates obtained.
The group has for several years purchased road passenger vehicles by means of lease and hire purchase arrangements at xed rates of interest over five year primary borrowing periods.
During the year the group renanced 44m of its bus eet finance lease arrangements, into a term loan.
This arrangement is at a xed rate of interest over a five year borrowing period, with repayments due annually in advance.
This did not alter the groups exposure to interest rates.
In the year, the group has entered into material operating leases amounting to 3m 2004 16m in terms of asset capital value.
This is done for some bus and coach purchases across the group where the purchases are made to service specic contracts.
Using operating leases for vehicle requirements on a back to back basis signicantly mitigates the risk of ownership at the end of the contract.
This has had the effect of incorporating 1.7m 2004 2.7m of cost within operating charges which would otherwise have been charged to interest.
The majority of assets in the rail division are nanced by operating leases, in particular rolling stock.
Leases are entered into by the respective operating companies and are not the subject of parent guarantees.
The group closely monitors fuel prices and takes out fuel derivatives when they deem appropriate.
The group rarely enters into transactions in foreign currency and no transaction to date has been material.
Should larger foreign currency transactions be undertaken, consideration would be given to hedge the foreign exchange risk.
46 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 2 July 2005 23 Derivatives and financial instruments continued The disclosures below exclude short-term debtors and creditors.
a Analysis of financial assets and liabilities The groups financial position at 2 July 2005 is in line with the above policies.
The financial assets and liabilities can be classied as follows 2005 2004 m m Financial liabilities Fixed rate 5.0% average rate 2004 5.8% 78.0 83.4 Floating rate 84.1 22.8 162.1 106.2 Financial assets Floating rate 98.7 74.7 63.4 31.5 Floating rates are based on LIBOR.
The weighted average period to maturity of the xed rate debt is 3 years 2004 3 years 9 months.
All of the groups financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
At 2 July 2005, the group had undrawn bilateral facilities of 50m.
These facilities are for 120m in total and are 364 day revolving with one year term out provisions.
The maturity of the groups financial liabilities is shown in notes 16, 17 and 19. b Fair values The book values and fair values of the groups financial instruments at 2 July 2005 are as follows 2005 2004 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Fuel price derivatives 0.3 1.0 The fair value of all other financial instruments is not signicantly different to their carrying amount.
The fuel price derivatives have been valued externally by the respective banks by comparison with the market fuel prices at 2 July 2005. c Hedge accounting The gains and losses on fuel price derivatives are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.

FRS 17 Retirement Benets was issued in November 2000, however, full implementation is not yet mandatory for the group.
The required transitional disclosures are set out below.
Non-Rail Schemes The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan For non-rail, non-Wilts & Dorset and non-Southern Vectis employees, the group operates one main scheme, through a separately administered trust, which consists of a funded dened benefit scheme that is contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and a dened contribution scheme that is contracted-in to the State Second Pension scheme.
The last formal valuation of the Go-Ahead plan was the actuarial valuation performed at 5 April 2003 by a professionally qualied actuary.
For the purposes of this valuation, the assets and liabilities were valued at their market value.
The employers contributions in respect of the dened contribution sections of the Go-Ahead plan were 2.4m 2004 2.2m, and this constitutes the pension charge.
The employers contributions in respect of the dened benefit sections of the Go-Ahead plan in the financial period were 6.8m 2004 7.0m.
These were paid in line with the schedule of contributions, being 11% and 10% of pensionable salaries paid to the upper and lower tier sections respectively.
In addition a lump sum contribution of 25m was paid into the plan during the year.
The dened benefit scheme is effectively closed to new entrants.
As a result it can be expected that the service cost will increase in future, as a percentage of payroll.
However, this higher percentage is likely to be applied to a reducing total pensionable payroll.
Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme Employees of Wilts & Dorset participate in the Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme.
This is a dened benefit scheme which is externally funded and contracted out of the State Second Pension Scheme.
The last formal valuation of the scheme was performed at 5 April 2002 by a professionally qualied actuary.
The employers contributions in respect of the scheme in the year were 0.6m 2004 1.1m.
These were paid in line with the schedule of contributions, being 9.9% of pensionable salaries.
The contribution rate is subject to review at future actuarial valuations.
The plan is open to new entrants.
Southern Vectis Pension Plan Employees of Southern Vectis group of companies participate in the Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan.
The last formal valuation of the scheme was performed at 6 April 2002 by a professionally qualied actuary.
The employers contributions in respect of the plan in the period since acquisition were nil.
Contributions are paid in line with the schedule of contributions, the contribution rate is subject to review at future actuarial valuations.
Other companies Employees of Meteor Parking, Plane Handling and Metrobus have access to separate dened contribution pension arrangements.
The pension cost in respect of those arrangements is equal to the contributions paid.
The Railways Pension Scheme Employees of Thameslink Rail Limited and New Southern Railway Limited participate in dened benefit sections of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS.
The accounting policy is to charge the contributions to these pension sections to the profit and loss account in accordance with actuarial advice.
This is on the basis that there is no recourse to the companies for any over or underfunding of their sections of the RPS at the end of the franchises.
The assets and liabilities of each companys section are separately identiable and segregated for funding purposes.
The latest available actuarial valuation of the RPS was carried out with an effective date of 31 December 2001.
The employers contributions made in respect of these companies in the financial period were 5.9m 2004 5.0m.
The Thameslink and Southern sections of the RPS are all open to new entrants.
Southern are currently contributing 7.5% of section pay to the scheme.
This rate is expected to continue until 16 December 2006 when the employer contribution rate will revert to 14.0% 60% of the long-term joint contribution rate of 23.4% of section pay.
Thameslink are currently contributing 14.43% of section pay to the scheme.
This rate is expected to continue until the end of the franchise.

The gures are included for disclosure purposes only.
The calculations used for FRS 17 disclosures have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Watson Wyatt LLP to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the pension plans at 2 July 2005.
Plan assets for the group arrangements are stated at their market value at 2 July 2005.
In applying FRS17, the directors believe that the rail schemes should be considered separately since the group has no rights or obligations in respect of the rail schemes following the expiry of the franchises.
The amounts relating to the rail schemes are shown separately.
The valuation method used is the Projected Unit Credit method and the financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under FRS 17 are as follows 2005 2004 2003 % %% Discount rate 5.2 6.0 5.5 Price ination 2.6 2.6 2.5 Rate of increase for pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.6 2.6 2.5 Rate of increase in salaries 4.1 4.1 4.0 The expected long-term rates of return on the main asset classes were: 2005 2004 2003 % % % Equities 8.3 8.5 8.7 Bonds government 4.3 5.0 4.5 Bonds corporate 5.2 6.0 5.5 Cash 4.1 4.1 4.0 Property 6.5 6.9 7.1 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 2 July 2005 49 Notes to the financial statements continued 24 Pension plan continued The fair value of the assets were: 2005 2004 2003 NonNonNonRail rail Rail rail Rail rail mm m m m m Equities 181.8 188.9 148.8 139.0 177.1 112.6 Bonds Government 32.5 19.2 26.0 20.7 15.9 11.4 Bonds Corporate 33.1 36.9 33.0 Cash 18.1 7.3 5.4 Property 19.0 19.5 14.4 11.4 Other 1.9 6.7 0.8 Market value of assets 235.2 278.8 195.9 203.9 205.2 162.4 Present value of liabilities 264.9 379.9 207.9 280.0 232.7 238.8 deficit 29.7 101.1 12.0 76.1 27.5 76.4 Deferred tax asset 8.9 30.3 3.6 22.9 8.2 22.9 Net pension liability 20.8 70.8 8.4 53.2 19.3 53.5 Rail 2003 includes Thames Trains The weighted average expected long-term rates of return were: 2005 2004 2003 % %% Non-Rail 7.2 7.5 7.6 Rail 7.6 7.8 8.3 The costs of the group schemes on an FRS 17 basis would have been: 2005 2004 NonNonRail rail Rail rail m m m m Charge to operating profit Current service costs 9.9 6.2 9.2 7.6 Past service costs Curtailment gain on Thames Trains disposal 5.9 9.9 6.2 3.3 7.6 Finance cost Interest on liabilities 7.9 16.7 6.5 14.7 Expected return on assets 9.3 15.5 8.1 13.6 1.4 1.2 1.6 1.1 Total charge before tax 8.5 7.4 1.7 8.7 Deferred tax credit 2.5 2.2 0.5 2.6 Total charge after tax 6.0 5.2 1.2 6.1 50 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 2 July 2005 24 Pension plan continued Other gains and losses of the group schemes would have been: 2005 2004 NonNonRail rail Rail rail mm m m Actuarial gains and losses Gains on assets 10.2 12.4 9.3 4.2 Experience losses gains on liabilities 1.7 0.9 6.2 17.1 Losses gains on change of assumptions 23.6 55.8 9.2 23.0 15.1 42.5 12.3 10.1 Deferred tax on actuarial gains and losses 4.5 12.7 3.7 3.1 10.6 29.8 8.6 7.0 History of experience gains and losses 2005 2004 2003 2002 NonNonNonNonRail rail Rail rail Rail rail Rail rail %% %% %%%% Gains on assets as a percentage of scheme assets 4.3 4.4 4.7 2.1 9.6 10.3 11.5 17.8 Experience gains and losses on liabilities as a percentage of scheme liabilities 0.6 0.3 3.0 6.1 2.4 0.7 0.1 5.5 Total actuarial gains recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses as a percentage of scheme liabilities 5.7 12.0 5.9 3.6 13.5 14.2 17.1 31.8 Analysis of the movement in deficit in the scheme for the year ended 2 July 2005 2005 2004 NonNonRail rail Rail rail m m m m Gross deficit at start of year 12.0 76.1 27.5 76.4 Thames Trains disposal 5.9 Southern Vectis acquisition 7.5 Wilts & Dorset acquisition 9.0 Contributions paid by employer 5.9 32.4 4.9 7.9 Current service cost 9.9 6.2 9.2 7.6 Other finance income 1.4 1.2 1.6 1.1 Actuarial losses gains 15.1 42.5 12.3 10.1 Gross deficit at end of year 29.7 101.1 12.0 76.1 Net assets and reserves as at 2 July 2005 2005 2004 m m Net assets Group net assets per balance sheet 143.1 112.2 Less SSAP 24 asset net of deferred tax 30.8 14.0 Group net assets excluding SSAP 24 pension asset 112.3 98.2 Less FRS 17 pension liability 91.6 61.6 Group net assets including FRS 17 pension liability 20.7 36.6 Reserves Group profit and loss reserve 75.8 35.1 Less SSAP 24 asset net of deferred tax 30.8 14.0 Group profit and loss excluding SSAP 24 FRS 17 pension asset 45.0 21.1 Less pension liability 91.6 61.6 Group profit and loss reserve including FRS 17 pension liability 46.6 40.5 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 2 July 2005 51 Notes to the financial statements continued 25 Contingent liabilities Performance bonds Group The group has provided bank guaranteed performance bonds of 39.9m 2004 32.6m to the SRA in support of the groups rail franchise operations.
