In addition, the Group contributes to the Executive Group Limited Shared Cost Section of the Railway Pension Scheme.
The assets of the MITIE schemes are held separately from the Group, being invested in equities and with insurance companies.
Contributions to the schemes are charged to the Profit and Loss Account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Group.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
The assets of the Executive scheme are held in separate trustee-administered funds, and the assets and liabilities of the section can be identified separately from those of other scheme sections.
The pension charge for defined benefit schemes for the year was 3,357,000 2004: 3,600,000.

The assets of the Scheme are held in separate trustee-administered funds, and the assets and liabilities of the Section can be identified separately from those of other Scheme Sections.
No contributions are currently payable to the Section.
In addition, no pension cost for the period has been incurred in respect of the Section, and there is no provision or pre-payment held.
The Scheme is subject to triennial valuation by independent actuaries.
The last valuation was at 31 December 2003 and used the projected unit method, in which the actuarial liability makes allowances for projected earnings.
The following were the principal actuarial assumptions applied: Investment returns 5.65% per annum Pension increases 2.50% per annum At the last actuarial valuation date, the value of the assets of the Section were 299,000 and, in the opinion of the actuary, this value was sufficient to cover 144% of the benefits that had accrued to members.
54 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report 2005 Notes to the Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2005 continued 26 Pensions continued b FRS 17 Retirement Benefits As stated above, the Group operates two principal defined benefit pension schemes and contributes to the Executive Group Limited Shared Cost Section of the Railway Pension Scheme.
The valuations used for the FRS 17 disclosure have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations at 6 April 2002, updated to 31 March 2005 by a qualified actuary.
As required by SSAP 24, the figures included in the Accounts in respect of the Group pension schemes are based on actuarial valuations carried out at 6 April 2002 and this does not take into account any impact of the movement in general stock market values since that date.
Any such impact will be reflected in the next SSAP 24 triennial valuation as at 6 April 2005, based upon which subsequent pension costs will be determined until the adoption of FRS 17.
The figures currently used for accounting purposes as regards pension costs are likely to change significantly as and when FRS 17 and IFRS are adopted.
The costs of death-in-service benefit for members of the Scheme are fully insured by the schemes.
The projected unit valuation method has been used.

58 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report 2005 International Financial Reporting Standards International Financial Reporting Standards Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS unaudited Introduction From the year ended 31 March 2006 onwards MITIE Group PLC will be adopting IFRS in its consolidated financial statements in compliance with European Union regulation.
This will lead to a number of changes in reported financial data, which will also be reflected in the Groups comparative financial information for the prior period.
The Group started its IFRS project in 2004.
The project has entailed an assessment of the impacts of IFRS on the Groups accounting policies and reported results as well as ensuring appropriate processes are in place to capture relevant information going forward.
The work is on track to provide an analysis of the full impact of the adoption of IFRS on the Groups audited 2005 and 2006 results and respective balance sheets.
Other than the format of presentation, there is not expected to be any cash flow impact from the adoption of IFRS.
We will disclose the full impact of the adoption of IFRS on our audited 2005 results with our Interim Results for the period ending 30 September 2005.
It is possible that other adjustments may come to light, as we complete our work, which will impact the Company in the preparation of the first full set of IFRS Financial Statements.
In addition, the process of approving standards and interpretations is still on-going by the International Accounting Standards Board and European Commission and as such further amendments may arise from this process.
In the meantime, we set out below the main decisions taken on first time adoption and a summary of the main areas of impact on the Groups operating profit and Balance Sheet together with indicative estimates of the related amounts.
IFRS 1 Exemptions IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Accounting Standards sets out the procedures the Group must follow when it adopts IFRS for the first time as the basis for preparing its consolidated financial statements.
The Group is required to determine its IFRS accounting policies and apply these retrospectively to determine its opening Balance Sheet under IFRS.
The standard allows a number of exceptions to this general principle to assist companies in their transition to reporting under IFRS.
The Group will take the following significant exemptions: Share-based payments: only equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 and that had not vested prior to 1 April 2005 will be included in the charge to income for the year ended 31 March 2005. Business combinations: business combinations prior to our transition date 1 April 2004 will not be restated.
Employee benefits: all actuarial gains and losses will be recognised in equity at the transition date.
This is to maintain consistency with the treatment under FRS 17 and the policy going forward of taking actuarial gains or losses directly to reserves via the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Summary of main areas of impact 1.
Share-based payments Under IFRS 2, the imputed fair value at the date of grant of options issued to employees under savings related and executive share option schemes will be charged to operating profit on a straight line basis over the relevant vesting period.
This will result in a reduction in the Groups reported operating profit, as the cost will be higher than that currently charged under UK GAAP.
The impact is estimated to be around 0.5 million in the year to 31 March 2005.
2. Business combinations: Goodwill and other intangibles Under IFRS 3, goodwill is no longer amortised and instead is assessed annually for impairment.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 April 2004 will not be restated: other intangible assets arising from acquisitions after 1 April 2004 will be separately identified and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives, which may be over shorter periods than goodwill has previously been amortised.
As a result of this change, the Groups operating profit will be increased by the amount of goodwill amortisation under UK GAAP.
For the year to 31 March 2005, this amounted to 2.8 million.
In the year to 31 March 2006, the Groups operating profit will be impacted by any impairment of goodwill and the amortisation of other purchased intangible assets on acquisitions post 1 April 2004.
