0138 27-68 AR Finance 5 4 05 3:16 pm Page 31 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies Accounting conventions The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries are made up to the nearest Saturday to 31 January each year, except as disclosed in note 15.
The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries are prepared under the historical cost convention, with the exception of land and buildings which are included in the financial statements at valuation, and are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom and the Companies Act 1985, except for those departures referred to below.
Compliance with SSAP 19 Accounting for Investment Properties relating to depreciation on investment properties and FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets relating to the capitalisation and amortisation of goodwill, both require a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 as explained below.
Accounting policies have been consistently applied.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associated undertakings.
Subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are recorded under the acquisition method and their results are included from the date of acquisition.
Associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method and joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
The results of subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associated undertakings which have been disposed during the year are included up to the effective date of disposal.
Kingfisher plc has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at contracted rates or, where no contract exists, at average monthly rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies which are held at the year end are translated into Sterling at year end exchange rates.
Exchange differences on monetary items are taken to the profit and loss account.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are expressed in Sterling at year end exchange rates.
Profits and losses of overseas subsidiary undertakings are expressed in Sterling at average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening shareholders funds are recorded as a movement on reserves, and are reported in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
The Groups share of net assets or liabilities of associated undertakings and joint ventures are expressed in sterling at year end exchange rates.
The share of profits or losses for the year are expressed in Sterling at average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net equity are recorded as a movement on reserves.
Exchange differences arising on borrowings used to finance, or provide a hedge against, Group equity investments in foreign subsidiaries are recorded as movements on reserves to the extent of exchange differences arising on the equity investments.
All other exchange movements are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Principal rate of exchange euro 2005 2004 Year end rate 1.447 1.465 Average rate 1.474 1.439 Turnover Turnover comprises retail sales and services supplied, interest receivable and other income from the provision of credit facilities, rental income and income from property development activities.
Turnover excludes transactions made between companies within the Group, Value Added Tax, other sales-related taxes and is net of returns, staff and trade discounts.
Turnover relating to the sale of in-store product is earned at the point of cash receipt.
All other turnover is recognised when the product has been delivered or, for installation income, when the service has been performed.
Delivered products and service income represent only a small component of the Groups turnover as a majority of the Groups sales relate to in-store purchase of product.
A provision for customer returns is made representing an estimate of sales recognised in the year but returned after the year end.
The provision is not discounted.
Cost of sales Cost of sales is the expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the product to the point of sale, including warehouse and transportation costs.
Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 31 0138 27-68 AR Finance 6 4 05 11:46 pm Page 32 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill, which represents the difference between the purchase consideration and the fair values of the net assets acquired, is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over a period which represents the Directors estimate of its useful economic life.
In estimating the useful economic life of goodwill arising, account has been taken of the nature of the business acquired, the stability of the industry, the extent of continuing barriers to market entry and expected future impact of competition.
Negative goodwill is amortised to the profit and loss account in the periods in which the non-monetary assets acquired are recovered whether through depreciation or sale.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 31 January 1998 is included in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provisions for impairment.
Goodwill related to joint ventures and associated undertakings is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Where goodwill is regarded as having an indefinite life it is not amortised.
The estimated useful economic life is regarded as indefinite where goodwill is capable of continued measurement and the durability of the acquired business can be demonstrated.
Where goodwill is not amortised an annual impairment review is performed and any impairment charged to the profit and loss account.
An indefinite life is applied on the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the minority interest in Castorama Dubois Investissements S. C. A, Screwfix Direct and the goodwill that arose on the purchase of Kingfishers initial equity investment in Hornbach Holding A. G. The Directors consider that each of these businesses have a proven ability to maintain their market leading positions over a long period and will adapt successfully to any foreseeable technological or customer-led changes and that barriers to entry into their markets exist, such that the businesses and their related goodwill will prove to be durable.
In this regard, in order to give a true and fair view, the financial statements depart from the requirement of amortising goodwill over a finite period, as required by the Companies Act.
Instead, annual impairment tests are undertaken and any impairment that is identified is charged to the profit and loss account.
It is not possible to quantify the effect of the departure from the Companies Act, because no finite life for goodwill can be identified.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are included in the balance sheet at cost or valuation, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is provided to reflect a reduction from cost to estimated residual value over the estimated useful life of the asset to the Group.
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated using the straight line method and the annual rates applicable to the principal categories are: Freehold and long leasehold buildings between 2% and 5% Short leaseholds over remaining period of the lease Tenants fixtures between 5% and 25% Computers and electronic equipment between 25% and 50% Motor cars 25% 1 Commercial vehicles between 10% and 33 3% Freehold land is not depreciated.
Tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant income generating unit or net realisable value if higher.
The discount rate is applied based upon the Groups weighted average cost of capital with appropriate adjustments for the risks associated with the relevant business.
Any impairment in value is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it occurs.
Properties Kingfishers freehold operating properties are revalued annually on a three year rolling basis and included in the balance sheet at existing use value.
Further information on the revaluations process is provided in note 14.
Investment properties are revalued annually and included in the balance sheet at their open market value.
In accordance with SSAP 19, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties.
This represents a departure from the Companies Act 1985 requirements to provide for the systematic annual depreciation of fixed assets.
However, these properties are held for investment and the Directors consider that the adoption of the above policy is necessary in order to give a true and fair view.
It is not possible to quantify the effect of the departure from the Companies Act, because no useful economic life is deemed appropriate.
Disposal of land and buildings Profits and losses on disposal of land and buildings represent the difference between the net proceeds and the net carrying value at the date of sale.
Sales are accounted for when there is an exchange of unconditional contracts.
Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 32 0138 27-68 AR Finance 2 4 05 10:48 am Page 33 Investments Fixed asset other than joint ventures and associates and current asset investments are included in the balance sheet at cost, less any provisions for impairment.
Leased assets Where assets are financed by leasing agreements that give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they have been purchased outright.
The amount capitalised is the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term and the assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful economic life.
Obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included as appropriate under creditors due within or after one year.
The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease.
All other leases are operating leases and the rental payments are charged to the profit and loss account in the financial year to which the payments relate.
Incentives received to enter into lease agreements are released to the profit and loss account over the lease term or, if shorter, the period to the date on which the rent is first expected to be adjusted to the prevailing market rate.
Capitalisation of interest Interest on borrowings to finance the construction of properties held as tangible fixed assets is capitalised.
Interest is capitalised from the date work starts on the property to the date when substantially all the activities that are necessary to get the property ready for use are complete.
Where construction is completed in parts, each part is considered separately when capitalising interest.
Interest is capitalised before any allowance for tax relief.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes appropriate attributable overheads and direct expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing goods to their present location and condition.
Rebates receivable from suppliers Volume related rebates receivable from suppliers are credited to the carrying value of the stock to which they relate.
Where a rebate agreement with a supplier covers more than one year the rebates are recognised in the accounts in the period in which they are earned.
Pensions The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes for its employees.
In each case a separate fund is being accumulated to meet the accruing liabilities.
The assets of each of these funds are either held under trusts or managed by insurance companies, and are entirely separate from the Groups assets.
In accordance with SSAP 24, the cost of pensions in respect of Kingfishers defined benefit schemes is charged to the profit and loss account so that it is spread over the working lives of employees.
Variations to pension costs caused by differences between the assumptions used and actual experience are spread over the average remaining working lives of the current employees at each actuarial valuation date.
In Kingfishers overseas companies, any defined benefit arrangements are generally funded by way of annual premiums to Group pension arrangements managed by insurance companies.
Deferred taxation Provision is made for deferred taxation using the incremental provision approach and is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date subject to the following: a Deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-monetary assets such as property unless a binding sale agreement exists at the balance sheet date.
Where rollover relief is available on an asset then deferred tax is in any case not recognised.
b Deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures only where dividends are accrued as receivable or there is an intention to remit these in the foreseeable future.
c Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Assets are regarded as recoverable when it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
d Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences.
Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 33 0138 27-68 AR Finance 5 4 05 2:28 pm Page 34 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments Financial assets are recognised on the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Discounts and premiums are charged or credited to the profit and loss account over the life of the asset or liability to which they relate.
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for using hedge accounting to the extent that they are held to hedge a financial asset or liability.
When a financial instrument ceases to be a hedge, either as a result of the underlying asset or liability being extinguished, or because a future event is no longer likely to occur, the instrument will thereafter be marked to its fair value and any loss accounted for in the financial statements.
Termination payments made or received in respect of derivatives are spread over the life of the underlying exposure in cases where the underlying exposure continues to exist and taken to the profit and loss account where the underlying exposure ceases to exist.
Outstanding contracts used to hedge against trading items which themselves will be accounted for in the profits or losses of a future period are not recognised, or are deferred when they mature, and are carried forward against corresponding gains and losses when they occur.
Income and expenditure arising on financial instruments held for hedging purposes is recognised on an accruals basis, and credited or charged to the profit and loss account in the financial period in which it arises.
For the purposes of notes 21, 22 and 24 to 27, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded.
The narrative disclosures required by FRS 13 are set out on pages 24 to 26 in the financial review.
Employee Share Ownership Plan The Groups Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP is a separately administered trust.
Liabilities of the ESOP are guaranteed by the Company and the assets of the ESOP mainly comprise shares in the Company.
In accordance with UITF 38, own shares held by the ESOP are deducted from shareholders funds.
All other assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOP have been included in the consolidated and Companys financial statements.
Discontinued operations In the comparative period ended 31 January 2004, discontinued operations include the results of the demerged Kesa Electricals and the non-core home improvement businesses disposed of, including interest and taxation attributable to these operations.
In the year ended 29 January 2005 the financial statements relate entirely to continuing operations.

The exceptional tax charge of 98.5m in the year ended 31 January 2004 related to tax paid to the French tax authorities as a consequence of the demerger of Kesa Electricals.
Kingfisher has initiated proceedings for the recovery of the tax paid and, although these proceedings may take some time to be resolved, considers that its risk of being ultimately liable for this amount is low.
The exceptional tax credits of 75.2m in the year ended 31 January 2004 were releases of provisions in respect of prior year liabilities which had either been agreed with the relevant tax authorities or where the likelihood of any liability arising was considered to be remote.
In certain circumstances it is possible that the conditions of the UK and French tax clearances for the demerger of Kesa Electricals could be breached.
Whilst the consequences of such a breach could be significant, Kingfisher actively monitors compliance with these conditions and believes that the likelihood of any breach is remote.

The weighted average number of shares in the prior year was adjusted for the share consolidation on 7 July 2003 as approved by the shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 4 July 2003, when the ordinary shares of 13.75p were consolidated on a 7 for 8 basis into ordinary 5 shares of 15 7p.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys shares during the year.
Supplementary earnings per share figures are presented.
These exclude the effects of operating and non-operating exceptional items and acquisition goodwill amortisation to allow comparison of underlying trading performance on a consistent basis.

The external valuations have been carried out by CB Richard Ellis Chartered Surveyors and Valuers in the UK, by FPD Savills Chartered Surveyors and Valuers in France and by Cushman & Wakefield Healy Baker Chartered Surveyors and Valuers in Poland and Italy.
All valuations were carried out as at 31 December 2004.
The remainder of the property portfolio has been revalued internally by qualified valuers employed by the Group.
Properties with any element of Group occupancy are valued on an existing use value basis, which does not take account of formal lease arrangements with Kingfisher companies or Kingfishers occupation of the premises.
Properties without Group occupancy are valued on the basis of open market value.
These valuation bases comply with the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Manual.
The Directors have resolved to incorporate these valuations in the financial statements and the resulting revaluation adjustments have been taken to the revaluation reserve.
The revaluations during the year ended 29 January 2005 resulted in a revaluation surplus of 175.8m 2004: 295.7m.

23 Currency risk To mitigate the effect of currency translation exposures arising from overseas investments, Kingfishers policy is to borrow in the local currencies of its principal operating subsidiaries.
Gains and losses arising on the financial instruments used to hedge the currency translation exposures are recognised in the statement of recognised gains and losses to the extent that there are gains and losses arising on the overseas investments in accordance with SSAP 20.
After taking into account the effect of any hedging transactions entered into to manage currency exposures, there were no significant net foreign currency monetary assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date.

Since the year end, Kingfisher has refinanced this facility, replacing it with a new committed bank revolving credit facility totalling 500m, provided by a number of banks.
This facility provides committed funding on improved terms, and in addition has extended the maturity to August 2010.
The facility is available to be drawn to support general corporate purposes.

The table below details the unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging and the movements thereon as follows: At 29 January 2005 Gains Losses Total net gains losses Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 February 2004 15.0 16.6 1.6 Gains and losses arising in previous years or pre-acquisition periods that were recognised in the period to 29 January 2005 2.9 16.6 13.7 Gains and losses arising in the previous years or pre-acquisition periods that were not recognised in the period to 29 January 2005 12.1 12.1 Gains and losses arising in the period to 29 January 2005 that were not recognised in that period 9.9 14.1 4.2 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 29 January 2005 22.0 14.1 7.9 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised within one year 2.6 14.1 11.5 Gains and losses expected to be recognised after more than one year 19.4 19.4 22.0 14.1 7.9 At 31 January 2004 Gains Losses Total net gains millions losses Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 2 February 2003 42.1 40.1 2.0 Gains and losses arising in previous years or pre-acquisition periods that were recognised in the period to 31 January 2004 29.6 40.1 10.5 Gains and losses arising in the previous years or pre-acquisition periods that were not recognised in the period to 31 January 2004 12.5 12.5 Gains and losses arising in the period ending 31 January 2004 that were not recognised in that period 2.5 16.6 14.1 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 January 2004 15.0 16.6 1.6 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised within one year 2.9 16.6 13.7 Gains and losses expected to be recognised after more than one year 12.1 12.1 15.0 16.6 1.6 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 2 February 2003 include unrealised losses of 33.1m in respect of a foreign exchange contract which, at that date, hedged expected euro receipts from the sale or Initial Public Offering IPO of Kesa Electricals.
As Kesa Electricals was subsequently demerged, part of the contract was no longer a hedge and was closed out at a cost of 83.1m, reflecting an adverse movement in the exchange rate since 2 February 2003.
This loss was recognised in the profit and loss account as an exceptional financing charge in the prior year.
In addition to the 83.1m, a further loss of 45.9m was offset through reserves against the gain arising on the repayment by Kesa Electricals of euro denominated loans at the date of demerger.
Gains and losses expected to be recognised after more than one year at 2 February 2003 included an unrecognised gain of 17.2m on an interest rate swap.
Subsequently debt associated with this swap was repaid as a consequence of the demerger of Kesa Electricals and a gain on the swap of 23.9m was recognised in the prior year.

Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 56 0138 27-68 AR Finance 2 4 05 10:52 am Page 57 33 Pension costs Pension schemes operated and regular pension costs SSAP 24 Kingfisher operates a variety of pension arrangements covering both funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes and funded defined contribution schemes.
By far the most significant are the funded defined benefit and defined contribution schemes for Kingfishers UK employees.
The total pension charge in the profit and loss account of 39.6m 2004: 44.7m includes 1.2m 2004: 2.3m for the UK defined contribution scheme.
A formal actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme the Scheme was carried out by an independent professionally qualified actuary, at 31 March 2002, using the projected unit method of funding.
In this valuation, the assets were taken at their market value of 900m excluding additional voluntary contributions.
A value was placed on the liabilities by discounting the anticipated future benefits, including allowance where appropriate for future increases in pension and pensionable salaries, using assumptions derived by reference to market conditions as at 31 March 2002.
The principal assumptions adopted for the future were an inflation rate of 3.0% p. a. an investment return on existing assets of 6.6% p. a. an investment return on future contributions of 6.6% p. a. pensionable pay increases of 4.6% p. a. and pension increases of 2.75% p. a.
On this basis, the assets were sufficient to cover over 101% of the Schemes liabilities.
The next valuation as at 31 March 2004 is currently being performed, the results for which have not yet been finalised.
The pension cost for this Scheme charged in the profit and loss account of 33.2m 2004: 37.9m was based on a formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 31 March 2002 described above, adjusted to reflect market movements since the date of this valuation, and in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs.
The valuation assumptions used for accounting purposes are an inflation rate of 3.0% p. a. an investment return on existing assets of 7.1% p. a. an investment return on future contributions of 6.6% p. a. pensionable pay increases of 4.6% p. a. and pension increases of 2.75% p. a.
Variations against regular cost have been amortised using the straight line method.
The pension cost for the Scheme is 6.9m lower than the contributions paid into the Scheme by the Group during the year.
On the basis of the demerger with Kesa Electricals and the ensuing changes in benefits, together with anticipated increases in actuary-advised contribution rates following the finalisation of the current valuation as at 31 March 2004, the contributions paid into the Scheme increased on the prior year to a rate of 20%.
There are also funded and unfunded defined benefit and defined contribution overseas pensions arrangements, for which the charge in the profit and loss account was 5.2m 2004: 4.5m.
FRS 17 disclosures The Accounting Standards Board has deferred the full mandatory adoption of FRS 17 following the move to International Financial Reporting Standards, therefore these financial statements incorporate only the transitional disclosure requirements of this standard.
The valuation of the Scheme used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation of Kingfishers UK defined benefit Scheme at 31 March 2002 and updated to 29 January 2005.
The financial assumptions used to calculate estimated Scheme liabilities under FRS 17 are: 2005 2004 2003 Annual percentage rate % %% Discount rate 5.3 5.6 5.5 Salary escalation 4.3 4.3 3.9 Rate of pension increases 2.7 2.7 2.3 Price inflation 2.7 2.7 2.3 The assets in the Scheme at 29 January 2005 and the expected future rates of return on them were: 2005 2004 2003 millions % millions % millions % Equities 511 7.8 566 8.0 388 8.5 Bonds 263 4.7 254 5.0 288 4.7 Property 81 6.2 32 6.5 7 7.0 Other principally cash 32 3.7 57 3.7 99 3.8 Total market value of assets 887 6.6 909 6.8 782 6.5 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,185 1,179 1,050 Deficit in the scheme 298 270 268 Related deferred tax asset 89 81 80 Net pension liability 209 189 188 Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 57 0138 27-68 AR Finance 6 4 05 5:06 pm Page 58 Notes to the accounts continued 33 Pension costs continued The assets and liabilities in the Scheme at 29 January 2005 no longer include those balances related to Kesa Electricals.
Under the terms of the Kesa Electricals demerger, the assets and liabilities associated with Kesa Electricals employees were transferred to a new Kesa Electricals scheme, those employees having ceased to participate in the Kingfisher Pension Scheme from 31 March 2004.
On 16 December 2004, the related settlement of these benefits was effected, giving rise to a payment by the Pension Scheme of 137.6m to the new Kesa Electricals scheme, and also giving rise to a settlement gain for the current year of 63.4m see further below.

From this date their options will be exercisable for a six-month period.
The rules of the Executive, International Executive, Phantom Share Option Schemes, Kingfisher Incentive Scheme and ShareSave Plan include provision for the early exercise of options in certain circumstances.
The options will become exercisable when the Groups EPS has grown by at least RPI 6% over a three year period.
The options will lapse unexercised if the performance conditions are not met by the fixed lapse date.
The table above includes the options which will be met by shares held in the Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP.
The Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP The Kingfisher ESOP is a discretionary trust which has been funded by a 113.5m interest free loan from the Company and its subsidiaries to acquire shares in Kingfisher plc.
The ESOPs shareholding on 29 January 2005 was 25,821,425 shares nominal value 4.1m valued at 78.4m on 29 January 2005.

The terms of the indemnity provide that claims in respect of the demerged electricals business should be paid by Kesa International Limited, and claims in respect of the home improvement business should be paid by Kingfisher France Limited, but in the event that either company fails to pay, the liquidators may have recourse against Kingfisher plc.
During the year, the liquidators entered into an agreement with the Company whereby the requirement for the bank guarantee was removed, except in circumstances where the credit rating of Kingfisher falls below BBB, when a bank guarantee for 50m would need to be provided.
The Company has given a letter of comfort to certain banks in respect of the obligations of its wholly owned subsidiary Halcyon Finance Limited under certain foreign exchange and interest rate contracts.
The notional amount outstanding under these contracts at the year end was 384m 2004: 377m.
In addition, Kingfisher has arranged for certain bank guarantees to be provided to third parties in the ordinary course of business.
The total amount outstanding at the year end was 51m 2004: 38m.
