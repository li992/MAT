Notes to the financial statements of parent company for the year ended 31 December 2005 1.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The accounts of The Laird Group PLC have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with UK accounting principles including applicable accounting standards.
Profit and loss As permitted by the exemption in Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
Details are set out in note 13.
Depreciation Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost or valuation of fixed assets evenly over their expected useful lives, principally as follows: Computer equipment 5 years or less Motor vehicles 4 years Other plant and machinery 13 years or less A proportion of one years depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Pensions The service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during the year is charged to the operating profit or loss in the year.
The full cost of providing amendments to benefits in respect of past service and gains and losses arising on unanticipated settlements or curtailments are also charged to the operating profit or loss in the year.
The expected return on the assets of the schemes during the year based on the market value of scheme assets at the start of the year and the expected increase in liabilities of the schemes are included within other finance charges income.
Differences between actual and expected returns on assets during the year are recognised in the statement of recognised gains and losses in the year together with differences from changes in assumptions.
The deficit on defined benefit pension schemes, net of deferred tax, is reported on the balance sheet as the pension liability.
The effect of adopting FRS 26 was to recognise additional income of 8.3m based upon the movement in the fair values of financial instruments during the period.
There was no material impact arising from the adoption of FRS 23.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but which have not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax subject to the following: a Deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-monetary assets such as property unless a binding sale agreement exists at the balance sheet date.
Where rollover relief is available on an asset then deferred tax is in any case not recognised.
b Deferred tax is not recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries unless dividends have been accrued as receivable or there is a binding agreement to distribute past earnings at the balance sheet date.
c Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Assets are regarded as recoverable when it is regarded as more likely than not there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The Laird Group PLC 87 Notes to the financial statements of parent company continued for the year ended 31 December 2005 1.
Accounting policies continued Financial assets Debtors are the only category of financial assets held by the Company.
Debtors are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Where the time value of money is material, debtors are carried at amortised cost.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on debtors carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate i. e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced, with the amount of the loss recognised in the profit and loss account.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value.
Measurement after initial recognition is at amortised cost, with the changes in the carrying amount being taken through the profit and loss account.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as currency swap contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
From 1 January 2005, such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken in the profit and loss account.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging for the year ended 31 December 2004 The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions contained within the transitional provisions of FRS 25 and 26.
Comparative amounts have been stated in accordance with UK GAAP, deferring the adoption of FRS 25 and 26 until 1 January 2005.
The previous accounting policy for financial instruments under UK GAAP was that forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign currency exposures arising on committed future transactions in foreign currencies.
The rates under such contracts are used to record the hedged item.
Interest differentials on interest rate swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable on an accruals basis.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value prior to maturity.
Share based payments In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20, the expense recognised in the Company profit and loss account relates to equity settled grants made after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on 1 January 2005.
The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP shares awarded is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP shares were awarded including market based performance conditions.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted.
Non-market company performance conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
For grants that ultimately do not vest charges previously made are reversed except that an expense is recognised for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided all the other performance conditions are satisfied.
Accounting policies continued At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms for an equity settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share based payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation or settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately.
Changes in accounting policy The Company has adopted FRS 20, Share-based payments, FRS 21, Events after balance sheet date, FRS 23 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates FRS 25, Financial instruments disclosure and presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
The adoption of these standards represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative figures have been restated where exemptions are not available.
The effect of adopting FRS 20 was to recognise an additional charge of 1.6m 2004, 0.8m in the year based on the fair value of shares awarded and share options granted.
The effect of adopting FRS 21 was to recognise the final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2004 in the current year.
The final proposed dividend for the current year of 10.3m will be recognised in the following year as it has yet to be approved by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
The effect of adopting the presentation requirements of FRS 25 are set out in note 7.
Impact on financial statements The 2004 accounts previously reported have been restated for the adoption of FRS 20, FRS 21 and FRS 26 as follows: dividend accruals have decreased by 9.5m and a deferred tax asset of 0.9m on share based payments has been recognised.
The net impact is that the loss for the year has decreased by 10.4m and shareholders funds increased by 10.4m.
Tangible assets The fixed assets of the Company at a cost of 0.7m 2004 0.5m and accumulated depreciation of 0.5m 2004, 0.4m are included above.
There were additions of 0.2m and disposals of nil during the year and depreciation in the year was 0.1m.

The timing of cash outflows are by their nature uncertain.
Pension schemes The Company operates three defined benefit schemes.
Approximately 45 2004, 51 employees are members of these defined benefit schemes and these schemes have approximately 1,200 2004, 1,200 deferred and current pensioners.
The employer contributions made to these schemes during the year was 5.9m 2004, 1.0m.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Pension costs are assessed by independent actuaries, full actuarial valuations being made every three years using either the projected unit or attained age methods.
The most recent actuarial valuations were made between January 2003 and January 2005.
The total assessed value of the schemes assets at 31 December 2005 at their market value is estimated at 66.8m 2004, 14.8m and the liabilities estimated at 81.6m 2004, 20.6m.
The resultant deficit in the schemes under FRS 17 is 14.8m 2004, 4.9m.
Since last year equity markets have risen, however this increase has not been sufficient to offset reductions in corporate bond yields and higher longevity assumptions for the schemes members which impact upon the value of discounted liabilities, resulting in a higher aggregate net pension liability.
The market value of the schemes assets, the present value of the schemes liabilities and the net pension liability under FRS 17 at 31 December were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 m m m Annuities 10.2 5.5 5.9 Equities 36.5 5.0 4.5 Gilts and bonds 14.6 3.8 3.1 Other including cash 5.5 0.5 1.4 Total market value of assets 66.8 14.8 14.9 Present value of scheme liabilities 81.6 20.6 18.1 Deficit in the schemes 14.8 5.8 3.2 Related deferred tax asset - 0.9 0.5 Net pension liability 14.8 4.9 2.7 The expected long term rates of return on the assets were: 2005 2004 2003 % % % Gilts and bonds 4.4 4.6 5.2 Equities 8.0 8.2 8.5 The returns on the annuities match the relevant liabilities.

At 31 December 2005 the Trust held 1,015,000 shares 2004, 1,015,000 shares of which 913,700 relate to the Long Term Incentive Plan.
The shares held by the Trust had a total market value at that date of 4.3m 2004, 3.2m.
A loss after taxation of 7.1m 2004, 5.6m has been debited to the profit and loss account brought forward of the Company after debiting exchange losses of 6.2m 2004, 4.6m and crediting dividends from subsidiary undertakings of 1.8m 2004, 6.5m.
Movements on equity not recognised in the profit and loss account were 11.0m.
The profit and loss account brought forward at 1 January 2005 is after crediting prior year adjustments of 10.4m relating to dividends of 9.5m and deferred tax on share based payments of 0.9m.
The special reserve of 55.5m was created by a transfer from the share premium account under High Court Sanction in December 1989.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Contingent liabilities At 31 December 2005 the Company had contingent liabilities as follows: a guarantees in respect of US Private Placement loans of 32.3m 2004, 31.8m : and b guarantees relating to the performance of contracts of subsidiary undertakings.
There are legal claims against the Company but none where the Board takes the view that it is likely that damages will be awarded against the Group which would have a materially adverse effect on its financial position.
Share based payments The Directors remuneration report on page 26, sets out the general terms and conditions including vesting requirements for all share based payment schemes: the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the 1994 Share Option Scheme and the 2003 Executive Share Option Plans.
All share based payments are equity settled.
An expense of 1.6m was recognised in the year 2004, 0.8m before employers national insurance and was based on the fair value of the LTIPs shares awarded and the share options granted.
The following table shows the number of LTIP awards including LTIP awards granted during the year.
Share based payments continued The following table shows the number and weighted average exercise price WAEP of, and movements in share options issued under the 1994 Share Option Scheme.
The balance of the share options were granted prior to 7 November 2002 and do not result in a charge against profits in accordance with the provisional arrangements of FRS 20.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was 353p 2004, 337p.
For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2005, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 4.3 years 2004, 5.7 years.

Share based payments continued The following table shows the number and weighted average exercise price WAEP of, and movements in share options issued under the 2003 Executive Share Option Plan.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was 345p.
For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2005, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 8.3 years 2004, 8.8 years.
194,000 options 2004, 194,000 in the price range 140p to 250p and 558,800 options 2004, 267,200 in the price range 251p to 343p are subject to the higher performance targets set out in the table on page 29 of the Directors remuneration report.
The fair value of LTIP shares awarded is estimated as at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIPs shares were awarded including the market based performance conditions set out in the Directors remuneration report.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted.
The non-market company performance conditions set out in the Directors remuneration report are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
The weighted average fair value of LTIP shares awarded during the year was 195p 2004, 177p and of share options granted during the year was 108p 2004, 92p.
The following table lists the inputs to the valuation models for the years ended 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2005.

The expected volatility of the LTIP shares is based on historical volatility: average of monthly activity over the last three years.
Expected volatility reflects the assumptions that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily prove to be the actual outcome.
Dividends are not payable on the LTIP shares prior to vesting and this is taken into account in calculating the fair value.
For the share option schemes, no allowance is considered necessary for leavers pre-vesting.
