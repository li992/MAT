41 Notes to the financial statements at 20 August 2005 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain properties within the Group and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
In accordance with FRS 18 the Directors have continued to review the accounting policies.
There have been no changes in accounting policy.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Punch Taverns plc and all its subsidiary undertakings for the 52 weeks to 20 August 2005.
All subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
Accordingly, the Group profit and loss account and statement of cash flows include the results and cash flows of subsidiaries from the date of acquisition to the period end.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and VAT.
All operations take place solely in the United Kingdom.
Wet sales Revenue in respect of wet sales, being beer and cider sales and wines, spirits and minerals sales, is recognised at the point at which the goods are delivered to the retailer, net of any discounts or volume rebates allowed.
Rents receivable Rents receivable are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Machine income The Groups share of net machine income is recognised as it arises.
Sales to customers by managed houses Managed house income is recognised at the point at which the goods are delivered and the cash is received.
Goodwill and negative goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised in the balance sheet within intangible fixed assets and is amortised over its useful economic life up to a presumed maximum of 20 years.
Negative goodwill arising on acquisitions is included within intangible fixed assets and is amortised over the estimated useful life of the non-monetary assets acquired, which is approximately 22 years.
Fixed assets and depreciation Valuation Trading properties within the estate are revalued professionally by independent valuers on a five-year rolling basis.
Surpluses arising from the professional valuation of the estate are taken directly to the revaluation reserve.
Valuation surpluses realised on sale are transferred from the revaluation reserve to the profit and loss account reserve.
Any deficit arising from the professional valuation of properties is taken directly to the revaluation reserve until the carrying amount reaches historical cost and thereafter, deficits below historical costs are charged to the profit and loss account except to the extent that the value in use exceeds the valuation in which case the deficit is taken to the revaluation reserve.
Depreciation It is the Groups policy to maintain the properties comprising the licensed estate in such a condition that the residual values of the properties, based on prices prevailing at the time of acquisition or subsequent revaluation, are at least equal to their book values.
The primary responsibility for the maintenance of such properties, ensuring that they remain in sound operational condition, is normally that of the lessee as required by their lease contracts with the Group.
Having regard to this, it is the opinion of the Directors that depreciation of any such property as required by the Companies Act 1985 and generally accepted accounting practice would not be material.
It is the opinion of the Directors that it is not practical or appropriate to separate from the value of the buildings the value of long life fixtures and fittings, which are an integral part of the buildings.
This approach is supported by the opinion of an independent external adviser.
Landlords fixtures and fittings include removable items, which are generally regarded as within landlord ownership.
These are depreciated in accordance with the policy detailed below.
An annual impairment review is carried out on all properties in accordance with FRS 11 and FRS 15.
Depreciation is provided on other tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Short leasehold properties over the lease term Landlords fixtures and fittings 5 years Office furniture and fittings 5 years Information technology developments over 3 to 10 years Information technology equipment 3 years Motor vehicles 5 years Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 42 Notes to the financial statements continued at 20 August 2005 1 Accounting policies continued Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of fixed assets, or gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of those assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Leasing commitments Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Pensions The Group contributes to money purchase pension plans for all employees.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable.
The InnSpired Group Ltd business, acquired during the period, and the Punch Taverns PM Ltd formerly Pubmistress Ltd business, acquired in the previous period, operated defined benefit schemes based on final pensionable pay.
Following integration of these businesses both schemes are now closed.
The Group now contributes to money purchase plans in respect of all employees who were members of the defined benefit schemes.
The assets of both schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Prior to their closure contributions to the schemes were charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over employees working lives with the Group.
Capital instruments Shares are included in shareholders funds.
Other instruments are classified as liabilities if they contain an obligation to transfer economic benefits and if not they are included in shareholders funds.
The finance cost recognised in the profit and loss account in respect of capital instruments other than equity shares is allocated to periods over the term of the instrument at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Derivative financial instruments are held to reduce exposure to interest rate movements.
To qualify as a hedge the financial instrument must be related to actual borrowings or a probable commitment and must reduce the risk of interest rate movements.
Gains and losses arising on these financial instruments are deferred and recognised in the profit and loss account only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in the Groups accounts.
The cost or income associated with caps and floors is recognised over the lesser of their duration or the period of the loans to which they relate, so as to give a constant proportion of the related loan notes outstanding.
In respect of interest rate swaps, interest differentials are recognised by accruing for net interest payable or receivable.
Interest rate caps, floors or swaps are not revalued to fair value if they are being used for hedging purposes.
If an instrument, which was being used as a hedge, is terminated early, the gain or loss arising is spread over the remaining maturity of the original instrument.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge because the underlying financial position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at that time.
com 43 2 Turnover and segmental analysis Turnover, which is stated net of value added tax, represents amounts charged to third parties.
Turnover, operating profit and assets and liabilities relate to the primary activity of leasing public houses to independent publicans and the wholesale supply of beer products to lessees.
A small number of pubs are directly managed by GRS Inns Ltd but do not have a material impact on the turnover, operating profit or assets of the group.
Turnover includes rent receivable from the licensed estate of 196.6m August 2004: 162.6m.

The deferred tax charge arises in respect of the origination and reversal of timing differences.
The Groups current period deferred tax charge reflects that in the period capital allowances exceeded depreciation.
This position is expected to continue given the Groups accounting policy not to charge depreciation on freehold and long leasehold buildings on the basis that this would not be material.
The tax charge will be lower than the standard corporation tax rate of 30% over the next two to three years if the Group is successful in using brought forward losses.
As a result of the acquisition of InnSpired Group Ltd, the Group owns further companies having tax losses carried forward.
These tax losses are only recognised as a deferred tax asset where it is reasonably foreseeable that they will be utilised in the next accounting period against taxable profits of the companies in which they originated.

On 1 August 2005 the Group concluded a refinancing that led to the Pubmaster group of companies acquired in December 2003 and the InnSpired group of companies acquired in September 2004 combining within a single security net.
The refinancing led to an improvement in the maturity profile of the Groups borrowings and a reduction, although modest due to the continuing effect of interest rate swaps the Group presently has in place, in the effective interest rate on the Groups borrowings.
On 8 August 2005 the Group, through its acquisition of Avebury Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries, acquired secured loan notes with a nominal value of 120.2m book value including fair value premium 142.8m issued by Avebury Properties Ltd and deep discounted bonds of 4.6m.

The capital amount of these swaps reduces over time to match the contractual repayment profile of the floating rate notes.
Punch Taverns Finance B Limited formerly Pubmaster Finance Limited As part of the refinancing, the Group entered into new interest rate swaps on 1 August 2005 which swap the LIBOR interest rate on the Class A8 and Class C notes to a fixed rate of 5.1% and 4.7577% respectively.
Prior to refinancing the Group had interest rate swap arrangements which swapped the LIBOR interest rate to a fixed rate of 5.7535% on the Class A1 and Class A2 notes and to 5.7% on the Class A4 and Class A5 notes.
The capital amount of these swaps reduced over time to match the expected repayment profile of the floating rate notes.
These swap arrangements were restructured as part of the refinancing on 1 August 2005 and replaced with the new arrangements described above.
Avebury Properties Limited Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into to swap the LIBOR interest rate to a fixed rate of 6.695% on the Class A1 notes.
Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 56 Notes to the financial statements continued at 20 August 2005 19 Financial instruments The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings and some cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions.
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Groups sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
There is no currency exposure as all transactions and financial instruments are in sterling.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for each of these risks and they are summarised below: Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity shareholders funds, loan notes and other bank loans.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then employs financial instruments to generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The cash balances attract interest at floating rates.
Where over-hedging arises for example, due to early repayment of floating rate notes the Group will seek to eliminate the overhedging, where this is financially practical, either by embedding the cost in new swaps or by terminating the over-hedge.
The Group has taken out capital instruments such that 94% of all loans at 20 August 2005 August 2004: 98% were either at fixed rate or were converted to fixed rate as a result of swap arrangements.
Following the repayment of the remaining Class A1, A2, A4 and A5 floating rate notes on 30 September 2005 as part of the refinancing of the Punch Taverns Finance B Ltd debt, 99% of all loans will be either at fixed rate or converted to fixed rate as a result of swap arrangements.
Liquidity risk The Group is primarily financed by secured loan notes, with approximately 88% August 2004: 90% of the capital balance on these loan notes being repayable after more than 5 years from the balance sheet date, subject to relevant covenants being met.
The Board continues to review alternative sources of finance.
Cash balances are invested in short-term deposits such that they are readily available to settle short-term liabilities or to fund capital additions.

The weighted average period until maturity of the nil rate liabilities is 4.9 years August 2004: 5.1 years.
The floating rate liabilities bear interest at rates linked to LIBOR.
Financial assets include sterling cash balances of 448.5m August 2004: 238.3m that earn interest at rates linked to LIBOR.
Cash balances include 30.7m August 2004: 73.0m of deposits used as security for guaranteed loan notes and 172.1m August 2004: nil of monies raised from the refinancing of Punch Taverns Finance B Ltd debt deposited on escrow to fund the redemption of floating rate debt and accrued interest on 30 September 2005.

The employees have to take their shares out of the plan on leaving the company and will not be entitled to the Matching Share if they leave within three years of buying the Partnership Shares.
If the Company awards dividends to its shareholders, the employee will receive a dividend on each of the Partnership and Matching Shares they hold.
The Company will arrange for the dividends to be used to buy extra shares Dividend Shares.
Dividend Shares must be held in the plan for three years before they can be removed unless the employee leaves the Company in which case they must be taken out.
The scheme was introduced in June 2004 with shares being acquired at market values on a monthly basis.
As at 20 August 2005 96,265 shares August 2004: 49,040 had been issued by the Company to the trust at par value.

30 Contingent liabilities The demerger of Spirit Group Holdings Ltd on 2 March 2002 was carried out under the provisions of ss213-218 ICTA 1988.
Usually, where a chargeable asset for tax purposes is transferred from one company to another company and both companies are within the same group, this transfer is at no gain no loss initially for tax purposes.
However, by virtue of s179 TCGA 1992 where the transferee Company leaves the Groups ownership within 6 years of the date of the transfer, a capital gain or loss will arise on the transferee by reference to the market value of the asset and the no gain no loss acquisition consideration.
Where the transferee company leaves the group under an exempt distribution, there is an exemption from the s179 charge.
However, the exemption from charge under s179 TCGA 1992 does not apply if there is a chargeable payment a payment not made for bona fide commercial reasons or made for tax avoidance purposes within 5 years of the exempt distribution.
A Deed of Tax Covenant was entered into by the Group and Spirit Group Holdings Ltd on 2 March 2002 as part of the demerger.
Under this Deed of Tax Covenant the Group has indemnified Spirit Group Holdings Ltd for any s179 TCGA 1992 exit charges that would arise if the Group made a chargeable payment within 5 years of the demerger or otherwise prevented the demerger dividend from being an exempt distribution.
