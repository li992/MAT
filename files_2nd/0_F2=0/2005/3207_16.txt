Notes to the Company Balance Sheet i.
Principal accounting policies of the Company Accounting principles The Company Balance Sheet has been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and under the historical cost convention and the Companies Act 1985.
The Company has adopted FRS 17, Retirement benefits, FRS 20, Share based payment, FRS 21 IAS 10, Events after the balance sheet date, FRS 25 IAS 32, Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation, and FRS 26 IAS 39, Financial instruments: Measurement, in these financial statements.
The adoption of each of these standards represents a change in accounting policy and accordingly the comparative figures have been restated where required.
Details of the effect of the change in policy are given in note xii.
Basis of preparation No Profit and Loss Account is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 230 3 of the Companies Act 1985.
The accounting policies for financial instruments are consistent with those of the Group, and are disclosed in note 2 to the Group Financial Statements.
The financial risk management policies are consistent with those of the Group and are described on page 20 and in note 34 to the Group Financial Statements.
Employee share schemes The Group has a number of employee share schemes, detailed in the Directors Report on page 24, the Remuneration Report on pages 30 to 31, and in note 26, under which it makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
For share-based payments to employees of the Company, the fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis together with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Equity-settled sharebased payments which are made available to employees of the Companys subsidiaries are treated as increases in equity over the vesting period of the award, with a corresponding increase in the Companys investments in subsidiaries, based on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will vest, and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using methods appropriate to each of the different schemes as follows: LTIS A Black-Scholes valuation augmented by a Monte Carlo simulation to predict the Total Shareholder Return performance Sharesave Black-Scholes ESOS Black-Scholes using an adjusted option life assumption to reflect the possibility of early exercise The Company has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of FRS 20, Share-based payment in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied FRS 20 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at closing rates of exchange.
Exchange differences on monetary assets and liabilities are taken to the Profit and Loss Account.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are included in the Balance Sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of individual assets over their estimated useful lives at periods ranging from five to 20 years.
Leases Rentals under operating leases are charged to the Profit and Loss Account on a straight-line basis.
Investments Fixed asset investments are held in the Balance Sheet at cost, less any provision for impairment as necessary.
Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Pensions and other retirement benefits The Companys employees participate in a number of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes as described in note 31.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the schemes on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore accounts for the schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes.
The charge to the Profit and Loss Account is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes in the accounting period.
Details of the defined benefit schemes of the Group accounted for in accordance with the Groups accounting policies detailed in note 2 can be found in note 31.

Principal accounting policies of the Company continued Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial Statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the Financial Statements.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits in the foreseeable future from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless, by the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the Financial Statements.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in the future has been entered into by the subsidiary or associate.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 117 Notes to the Company Balance Sheet continued xii.
Changes in accounting policy The Company has adopted the following standards with effect from 1 January 2005: FRS 17, Retirement benefits, FRS 20, Share-based payment, FRS 21 IAS 10, Events after the balance sheet date, FRS 25, Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation and FRS 26, Financial instruments: Measurement.
The Company previously accounted for retirement benefits in accordance with SSAP 24.
The charge to the Profit and Loss Account comprised the cost of providing retirement pensions and other benefits, spread over the period benefiting the employees service.
The Company recognised a provision or prepayment which represented the difference between charges to the Profit and Loss Account and contributions paid to the pension schemes.
Under FRS 17, the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the schemes on a consistent and reasonable basis.
Therefore the Companys charge to the Profit and Loss Account is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes in the accounting period.
The implementation of FRS 17 has resulted in a reduction to the Companys previously reported net assets of 25 million at 31 December 2004, and a reduction of 30 million to the Companys previously reported profits for the year then ended.
The Company previously accounted for share-based payments in accordance with UITF 38 and UITF 17 revised 2003.
These abstracts required own shares held under trust to be shown as a deduction from shareholders funds, while the profit and loss charge was determined as the intrinsic value of the options granted.
Under FRS 20, own shares held under trust continue to be presented as a deduction from shareholders funds, but equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of the number of instruments that will satisfy non-market vesting conditions.
The implementation of FRS 20 has resulted in a reduction of the Companys previously reported net assets of 14 million at 31 December 2004, an increase to the Companys previously reported profits of 26 million, and a debit to the share option reserve of 23 million for the year then ended.
FRS 21, Events after the balance sheet date, requires that dividends declared after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date, because the liability does not represent a present obligation.
Instead, dividends will be recognised in the period in which they are declared and approved.
This has the effect of increasing net assets at 31 December 2004 by 230 million.
The retained earnings for 2004 include the 2003 final dividend of 157 million, the 2004 interim dividend of 108 million and the special dividend of 1,050 million.
The 2004 final dividend of 230 million is reflected in 2005.
The Company adopted FRS 25 and FRS 26 with effect from 1 January 2005.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of those standards, the comparative information for 2004 has not been restated.
The accounting policies of the Company for 2004 and 2005 in respect of financial instruments are consistent with those of the Group, and are detailed in note 2.
The effect of adopting FRS 26 was to increase net assets at 1 January 2005 by 2 million.
In accordance with paragraph 3 c of FRS 25, the Company is exempt from the disclosure requirements of paragraphs 51 to 95 of FRS 25.
The Companys financial instruments are consolidated with those of the Group and are incorporated into the disclosures in note 34.
The Company was also required to adopt FRS 22 IAS 33, Earnings per share, FRS 23 IAS 21, The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, and FRS 24 IAS 29, Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies, none of which are material for the Company.
Comparative figures have been restated in the Company Balance Sheet and notes iii, iv, vii, ix, and x.
