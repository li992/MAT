The relocation provision had reduced to zero at 30 September 2005, the other provisions are expected to be utilised within five years.
The liability for deferred taxation for which provision has been made is analysed as follows: 2005 2004 m m Accelerated capital allowances 2.4 - Other timing differences 3.1 2.1 Provision at 30 September 2005 0.7 2.1 In addition there are unprovided deferred tax assets of approximately 7.3m 2004: 13.0m.

The directors consider that there is insufficient evidence that such profits will arise to justify the recognition of a deferred tax asset in respect of these balances.
