Derecognition of financial assets & liabilities Financial assets A financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash ows from the asset have expired: the Company retains the right to receive cash ows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: or the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash ows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modied, such an exchange or modication is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Financial instruments Prospective adoption of FRS25 & FRS26 As permitted by FRS26, the Company has elected to apply FRS25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and FRS26 Financial Instruments: Measurement prospectively from 1 January 2005.
As a result, the relevant comparative information for the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2004 and as at 31 December 2004 does not reect the impact of these standards and is accounted for in accordance with previous UK GAAP.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.
The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Under previous UK GAAP, such derivative contracts are not recognised as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and gains or losses arising on them are not recognised until the hedged item is itself recognised in the financial statements.
From 1 January 2005 onwards, derivative financial instruments have been recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity proles.
Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the profit and loss account.
Treasury shares The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classied in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
2. profit attributable to the Company The profit dealt with in the financial statements of the Company was 31,982,000 2004: 22,992,000.
In accordance with the concession granted under section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the Company has not been separately presented in these financial statements.
Dividends paid and proposed 2005 2004 000 000 Declared & paid during the period: Equity dividends on ordinary shares: Final dividend for 2004: 9.35p 2003: 9.05p 19,308 18,564 Interim dividend for 2005: 3.55p 2004: 3.45p 7,297 7,124 26,605 25,688 Proposed for approval by shareholders at the AGM: Final dividend for 2005: 9.65p 2004: 9.35p 19,947 19,362 The proposed dividend is based on the number of shares in issue, excluding treasury shares, at the date the financial statements were approved and authorised for issue.
The final dividend may differ due to increases or decreases in the number of shares in issue between the date of approval of the report and financial statements and the record date for the final dividend.

The actual outcome may differ, and in some cases, this will be dependent on the outcome of legal proceedings.
It is expected that the majority of these costs will be incurred within one year with the remaining costs expected to be incurred within five years of the balance sheet date.

Retirement benets The Company participates in the dened benets plan arrangements within The Weir Group Pension and Retirement Savings Scheme and The Weir Group 1972 Pensions and Life Assurance Plan for Senior Executives.
These dened benets plans are multi-employer plans which are operated by The Weir Group PLC and which are run on a basis that does not enable individual companies to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities.
In accordance with FRS17 the Company accounts for its contributions to these plans as if they were dened contribution plans.
As at 30 December 2005, there is an overall deficit of 46,100,000 2004: 82,460,000 in these pension plans.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the dened benets plan within The Weir Group Pension and Retirement Savings Scheme was as at 31 December 2002 and this has been adjusted to reect the positions at the 2003, 2004 and 2005 year ends by a qualied independent actuary.
The latest full actuarial valuation of The Weir Group 1972 Pensions and Life Assurance Plan for Senior Executives was as at 31 December 2004 and this has been adjusted to reect the position at the 2005 year end by a qualied independent actuary.
It is intended that the next full actuarial assessment of the dened benets plan section of The Weir Group Pension and Retirement Savings Scheme will take place as at 31 December 2005.
In addition to the employers regular contributions, further contributions of 10,000,000 were made in the first half of 2003, the first half of 2004 and the second half of 2005.
Further contributions of 7,000,000, in addition to the employers regular contributions are expected to be made in 2006.
For these closed plans, the current service cost is expected to increase under the projected unit method as the members of the plan approach retirement.

100 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2005 11.
In preparing the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2005, the Company has adopted the following new accounting standards: FRS20 - Share-based Payment, FRS21 - Events After the Balance Sheet Date, FRS23 - The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, FRS25 - Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, FRS26 - Financial Instruments: Measurement and FRS28 - Corresponding Amounts Under FRS20, the cost of employee share schemes, including SAYE schemes, is based on the fair value of the awards that must be assessed using an option pricing model and expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Prior to this, the cost of awards was based on the intrinsic value of the awards, excluding SAYE schemes, which were exempt.
As a result, the cost of employee share schemes recognised in 2004 reduced by 244,000 with a related deferred tax charge of 48,000.
Under FRS21, dividends are only recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared.
As such, the proposed final dividend for 2004 amounting to 19,362,000 2003: 18,525,000 is no longer accrued as well as the proposed dividends for 2004 due from subsidiaries of 9,334,000 2003: 9,703,000.
Under FRS23, exchange differences that arise on translating a monetary item which forms part of a reporting entity's net investment in a foreign operation should be taken to profit or loss in the separate financial statements of the reporting entity or foreign operation as appropriate.
In the financial statements that include the foreign operation and the reporting entity, such exchange differences should be recognised directly in equity.
Prior to this, exchange differences amounting to 101,000 were recognised directly in equity by the reporting entity.
The Company has elected to apply FRS25 and FRS26 prospectively from 1 January 2005 and, as permitted by FRS26, the comparative information for 2004 has not been restated.
The new accounting policy in respect of financial instruments is included in note 1.
For accounting periods up to the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2004, derivative contracts were not recognised as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and gains and losses arising on them were not recognised until the hedged item had itself been recognised in the financial statements.
The adoption of these standards had no impact on the financial statements of the Company as at 1 January 2005.
These standards resulted in prior year adjustments, with the exception of FRS25 and FRS26, which were adopted prospectively from 1 January 2005.
The impact of the other standards on the prior year financial statements is set out in the table below.

Reserves continued Under FRS28, corresponding amounts are required to be disclosed in the primary financial statements and notes to the financial statements.
As such, comparative information has been provided in respect of the movements in reserves.
In addition, the Company has decided to restate the carrying value of its investments in subsidiaries and associates to historical cost as, following the conversion of the Group financial statements onto an IFRS basis, it is no longer considered practical to apply the previous revaluation policy.
For accounting periods up to and including the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2004, investments in subsidiaries and associates were held at valuation representing the amount of underlying net assets at the balance sheet date including related unamortised goodwill together with the unallocated pension liability relating to subsidiaries.
This has resulted in a prior year adjustment to remove losses on the revaluation reserve and profit and loss reserves as at 27 December 2003 amounting to 54,944,000 and 9,773,000 respectively, remove the surplus recognised in revaluation reserve and the loss recognised in the profit and loss account for the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2004 amounting to 12,288,000 and 4,806,000 respectively and to reect a corresponding increase in the carrying value of subsidiaries of 75,210,000 and reduction in the carrying value of associates of 17,975,000.

The Company is, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business.
The directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial position.
Financial risk management objectives & policies A description of the Group's financial risk management objectives and policies is provided in note 30 to the Group financial statements.
