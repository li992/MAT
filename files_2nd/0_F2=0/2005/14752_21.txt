Contingent liabilities Litigation The Group is involved in a number of lawsuits in the USA alleging the development of sensitivities to natural rubber latex.
All the lawsuits relate to SSLs medical gloves business, which SSL sold during the year.
Responsibility for the consequences if any of such litigation, including legal liability and costs, will remain with the Group for products manufactured and or sold prior to completion of the disposal of the medical gloves business.
There are currently very few outstanding cases, and no new lawsuits have been commenced against the Group in the last two years.
The Directors believe that the Group has defences available to any such claims.
During the year the Group received settlement from an insurer in respect of costs and expenses incurred in natural rubber latex lawsuits in previous years.
As part of the settlement SSL has released this insurer from any future latex allergy claims arising in North America from the use of medical gloves.
A provision exists as at 31 March 2005 in respect of the existing and continuing claims.
The Directors believe the provision is adequate.
The Group is also a defendant in a number of other lawsuits incidental to its operations which, in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Group.
Office of Fair Trading The Group has, since late 2002, been assisting the OFT with investigations into certain aspects of the Groups condom pricing strategy in the UK.
On 10 May 2005 the OFT informed the Group that it has now concluded its investigation and has closed the case.
In April 2005 the OFT announced that it will review certain undertakings given in 1994 by LRC Products Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, to prevent restrictions on competition in the supply of condoms in the UK.
The OFT has a general duty to keep all such undertakings under review: the outcome of such review can be the release, variation or supercession of such undertakings.
The Directors believe that the Company has complied fully with the terms of the undertakings and that, whatever the outcome of the OFT review, there is unlikely to be a material adverse impact on the Group.

SSL International plc Annual Report 2005 65 Notes to the Financial Statements 31.
Pension costs continued The principal assumptions used by the actuaries in determining the present value of the liabilities were: During the year, the mortality assumption has been updated to reflect recent studies which indicate that people are, in general, living longer than previously assumed and this is expected to continue.
The change in the mortality assumption reflects an increase in the assumed life expectancy for a 65 year old male from 18.6 to 21.9 years.
This has served to increase the actuarial value of the liabilities and is reflected in the changes in assumptions in the statement of recognised gains and losses.
