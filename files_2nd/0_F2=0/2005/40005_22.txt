Statement of the Directors responsibilities For the preparation of financial statements UK company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year.
In preparing the financial statements the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state that the financial statements comply with IFRS: prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the financial information, including the Annual Report, on the Slough Estates plc website.
Note: Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
