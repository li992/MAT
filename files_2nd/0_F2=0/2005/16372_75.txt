Unilever has reviewed the extent of its business with major customers, and has concluded that it has no customers that would require separate disclosure during the reporting periods covered by this ling.
For management reporting purposes, Unilever uses a number of measures of segment performance at constant average rates of exchange that is, the same rates as in the preceding year.
The internal management measure of profit that is most consistent with operating profit reported in the accounts is Trading Result.
This differs from operating profit, mainly because Trading Result includes a number of statistical and other adjustments including the application of an ination charge on working capital which is added back to arrive at operating profit.
