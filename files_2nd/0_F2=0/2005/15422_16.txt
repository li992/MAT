Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available for sale investments, financial assets and liabilities held for trading.
Prior to 2005, the group prepared its financial statements under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
First time adoption of IFRS These financial statements follow the requirements and options in IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards as they relate to the 2004 comparatives included therein.
Certain of the requirements and options in IFRS 1 relating to comparative financial information presented on first-time adoption result in a different application of accounting policies in the 2004 restated financial information to that which would have applied had the 2004 financial statements been the first financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
An explanation of how transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the groups financial position, income statement and cash flows is set out in note 32.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the following key exemptions have been taken in the transition to IFRS.
Business combinations prior to the transition date have not been restated.
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses of defined benefit or post retirement plans have been taken directly to equity at the transition date.
Recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments have only been applied to equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
Financial instruments have continued to be reported in accordance with UK GAAP for the 2004 comparative period.
Cumulative translation differences for all foreign currency operations have been reset to nil as at 1 January 2004.
Changes in accounting policy The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, except those relating to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
The group has made use of the exemption available under IFRS 1 to apply the standards related to financial instruments, IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, only from 1 January 2005.
In addition, as at 31 December 2004, the group has not adopted IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which is only effective for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2005.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
In particular, managements assumptions in performing the annual goodwill impairment review are considered key sources of estimation of uncertainty at the balance sheet date, and are disclosed in note 10.
Basis of consolidation The annual group financial statements consolidate the results of Taylor Nelson Sofres plc, its subsidiary undertakings and proportionate share of jointly controlled entities, and incorporate the post-acquisition results of its share of associates for each financial year.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the group.
Control exists when the group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The results of all subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of are accounted for under acquisition accounting rules and are included in the income statement from the effective date of control until the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries and adjustments are made if necessary to ensure consistency of subsidiaries accounting policies with the group.
All intra-group transactions are eliminated as part of the consolidation process.
Jointly controlled entities Joint ventures are those entities in which the group holds a long-term interest and which are jointly controlled by the group and one or more venturers under a contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include the groups proportionate share of the entities assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and cash flows on a line by line basis, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases.
The results of joint ventures are adjusted where necessary to ensure the sixth sense of business 55 1 Accounting policies continued consistency with group accounting policies.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest.
Associates Associates are those undertakings, other than subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities, in which the group holds a long-term participating interest and exerts a significant influence but not control.
The groups share of profits or losses of associates after interest and taxation is included in the group income statement and the groups share of their net assets, together with goodwill arising on acquisition, is included in the group balance sheet.
The groups share of losses are recognised up to the carrying value of the individual associate, unless the group has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
The results of associates are adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with group accounting policies.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest.
Revenue recognition Revenue consists of the fair value of the sale of products and services net of sales tax, rebates and discounts after eliminating sales within the group.
Revenue and profits on short-term projects are recognised on the completion of the project, once the product and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the client.
Costs incurred on projects up to completion are included within work-in-progress.
Revenue and profits on long-term or continuous projects are recognised on the satisfactory completion of each service delivery phase of the project.
Costs incurred on projects are included within work-inprogress until completion of each phase.
Amounts invoiced to clients in advance of revenue and profits being recognised are shown as payments received on account within creditors.
Segmental reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the group that is engaged either in providing products or services within a particular economic environment geographical segment or providing products or services that are subject to risks and rewards that are different to other segments business segment.
Share based payments The fair value of the employee share option plans is calculated at the date of grant using appropriate models.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based Payments the difference between the fair value and the exercise price of the share option is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the options.
The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of option vesting.
Bank facility arrangement fees Bank facility arrangement fees are capitalised and charged to the income statement over the life of the bank facilities.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired at the date of acquisition of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate.
Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
In respect of associates, the carrying amount of the goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate.
If the fair value of net assets acquired exceeds the consideration given then the excess is credited to the income statement in the year of acquisition.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying value of related goodwill.
Any goodwill previously written off directly to reserves is not included in the gain or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Costs that are directly associated with the production of software for internal use in the business are capitalised as an intangible asset.
Software that forms an integral part of related hardware is capitalised with the hardware and included within property, plant and equipment.
Acquired intangible assets comprises software licences, patents, customer lists, trademarks and brands.
Intangible assets are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Patents and licenses 20 years or remaining life if shorter Software and databases and other assets 5 years or remaining life if shorter Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount, and taken immediately to the income statement.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less cost to sell and its value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Property, plant and equipment PPE PPE is stated at original cost including costs directly attributable to acquiring assets or, where appropriate, fair value when 56 TNS annual report 2005 acquired, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where an item of PPE comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of PPE.
Assets under construction consists of costs directly attributable to purchasing and installing PPE ahead of their productive use.
External and internal costs are capitalised to the extent that they enhance future economic benefits accruing to the group.
Internal costs are only capitalised if they are also incremental to the group.
Provisions are made and charged to the income statement where the value of assets has been impaired in relation to their value-in-use to the business and charged to the income statement.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows: Freehold land no depreciation Freehold buildings 33 years Short leasehold land and buildings term of lease Equipment 310 years No depreciation is charged on assets under construction until they are brought into use by the business Finance and operating leases Leases in which the group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised and depreciated over their useful lives, or the term of the lease if shorter.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation, so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining liability.
Rentals under operating leases are charged directly to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Inventories work-in-progress Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct costs incurred on incomplete client projects and an appropriate element of attributable overheads.
Pension arrangements The group operates a number of contributory pension plans.
The majority of employees participate in defined contribution plans that are set up through insurance companies.
Contributions are also made to personal pension plans at equivalent rates.
Payments in respect of such current service contributions are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
The group also operates a number of defined benefit pension plans which are accounted for under IAS 19 Employment Benefits.
Obligations under defined benefit plans are measured at discounted present value by actuaries, while plan assets are recorded at fair value.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement.
Service costs are recorded in operating costs and are spread over the working lives of employees.
Financing costs are recorded in finance costs and recognised in the years in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are taken directly to reserves in the year in which they arise, the group having taken this option under an amendment to IAS 19, which the group has adopted early.
Employee share ownership plans Shares in Taylor Nelson Sofres plc held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP and the Employee Benefit Trust EBT are included within equity at cost less provisions for any permanent diminution in value.
Net operating income from the plans is included under finance income in the groups consolidated income statement.
Costs of administration are included in the consolidated income statement as they accrue.
Profits arising on the disposal of shares held by the EBT as a result of the exercise of options are taken to reserves.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year as adjusted for items that are not taxable or not deductible and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Full provision is made for the tax effects of these differences.
Taxation is charged to the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the taxation is also recognised in equity.
Tax deferred or accelerated by the effect of temporary differences is accounted for to the extent that a transaction or event that has occurred at the balance sheet date gives rise to an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that, based on available evidence, it is probable that suitable taxable profits will arise from which the reversal of the asset can be deducted.
Dividends Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the year in which they are approved by the company in general meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash in hand, bank deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid the sixth sense of business 57 1 Accounting policies continued investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows, and are shown within borrowings under current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value reduced by estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Provision for impairment is recognised where there is evidence that the full amount of the trade receivable is not collectible, and is charged to the income statement.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is more likely than not that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are discounted where the effect is material.
Financial instruments The accounting policies adopted in respect of financial instruments in years up to and including 31 December 2004 are set out in the 2004 annual report except that to provide comparability, financial assets and liabilities have been reclassified according to IFRS categories, as set out below.
Up to 31 December 2004, in accordance with the UK GAAP financial assets are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Debt instruments are stated at the amount of the net proceeds, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
Financial assets Under IFRS, financial assets are classified as either financial assets held at fair value through the income statement, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available for sale financial assets see below.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments are acquired.
Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this at each reporting date.
Financial assets held for trading and those designated as held at fair value by management at inception are measured at fair value through the income statement.
Loans and receivables that are not derivative financial assets, with fixed or determinable payments and that are not quoted in active markets, are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with changes in carrying value recognised in the income statement.
Loans and receivables excludes items that the group intends to sell immediately or in the short term which are classified as held for trading and those for which the group may not recover substantially all of its initial investment other than because of credit deterioration which are classified as available for sale.
Financial assets are classified as held to maturity if the group has positive intent and ability, from inception, to hold the securities to their maturity date.
These financial assets have fixed or determinable payments and a fixed maturity.
Held to maturity financial assets are reported at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with changes in carrying value recognised in the income statement.
Financial assets classified as available for sale are either specifically designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
Available for sale assets are carried at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses except for changes in exchange rates for monetary items, interest and impairment losses recognised in equity until the financial asset is derecognised, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is taken to the income statement.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are stated at fair value adjusted for transaction costs attributable to the issue of those financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method and, if included in a fair value hedge relationship, are revalued to reflect the fair value movements on the effective portion of the hedged risk associated with the financial liability.
The effect of the currency element of currency swaps acting as hedges against debt is reported separately in current and non-current assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments mainly to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risks and interest rate movements.
The group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for financial trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, for derivative financial instruments classified as held for trading, gains and losses on re-measurement to fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge see hedge accounting policies below.
Derivative financial instruments are classified as current assets or current liabilities 58 TNS annual report 2005 where they are held for trading, or have a maturity within twelve months.
Where derivative financial instruments have a maturity greater than twelve months and are designated as in a hedge relationship, they are classified within either non-current assets or non-current liabilities consistent with the maturity profile of the underlying hedged items.
The fair value of swaps is the estimated amount that the group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest and foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
Derivatives embedded within assets and liabilities, which are not closely related to the underlying item, are measured at fair value and accounted for separately.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes the designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged financial asset or liability remains or forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place or the underlying hedged financial asset or liability no longer exists, then the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow hedge accounting When a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probably transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognised directly in equity.
The associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the same year or years during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement in line with the treatment of the underlying hedged transaction.
When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, or the forecast transaction for a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost or carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, then the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into the income statement in the same year or years during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the income statement.
Fair value hedge accounting When a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probably transaction, the change in fair value of the derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in fair value of the hedged assets or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operation Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the net investment in foreign entities and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investment are taken to shareholders equity on consolidation to the extent the hedges are deemed effective.
All other exchange gains or losses are dealt with through the income statement and are included within the groups operating profit.
Foreign currency translation Amounts included in the financial statements of each of the groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow or investment hedges.
Translation differences on non-monetary items, such as available-for-sale investments are included in equity.
The results and financial position of all group companies that have a functional currency other than sterling are translated as follows: Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates All resulting differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, these exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing rate.

In 2004 administrative costs included exceptional integration costs of 9.8m, which were incurred in relation to the integration of NFO, a 2003 acquisition.
The costs arose from the merger of businesses around the group and included staff severance costs, vacant property provisions and other charges.

Factors which may affect future tax charges The groups deferred tax assets of 29.6m 2004 29.2m relate to net operating losses and timing differences.
The group expects to use these losses in the foreseeable future.
There are no unprovided deferred tax liabilities in the company or group.
Deferred tax assets of 1.5m 2004 1.0m in respect of tax losses carried forward have not been recognised due to insufficient certainty over their recoverability.

The final proposed dividend does not include a dividend on shares issued on the exercise of employee share options and allotment of new shares since 31 December 2005 or on other options, which may be exercised prior to 26 May 2006, the record date.
9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share of 11.8p 2004 10.0p have been calculated on the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent company of 52.1m 2004 43.6m and on 441.6 million shares 2004 437.6 million, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the ESOP and the EBT, which are treated as cancelled.
The diluted earnings per share have been calculated in accordance with the provisions of IAS 33, Earnings Per Share, with the weighted average number of shares in issue being adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares for the period they were outstanding.
Shares held by the ESOP and the EBT, which are under performance-based options, are included in the diluted weighted average number of shares, as the performance conditions are deemed to have been met for the purposes of this calculation.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year for the purpose of these calculations is as follows: 2005 2004 millions millions Share capital 447.4 445.1 Shares held by ESOP 0.4 1.1 Shares held by EBT 5.4 6.4 Basic earnings per share denominator 441.6 437.6 Dilutive effect of share options 8.3 9.9 Diluted earnings per share denominator 449.9 447.5 the sixth sense of business 65 9 Earnings per share continued An adjusted earnings per share using an adjusted profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent company is also presented, as the directors believe that this assists in understanding the underlying performance of the group.

During the year the carrying value of goodwill was tested for impairment against its value in use, based on discounted cash flow projections.
Cash flows were projected to 2008 using budgets approved by management, and then extrapolated using an annual growth rate of 5% until 2010.
The following regional assumptions were used, the discount rates being based on the groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted by market-based regional risk premiums.

This impairment arose as the result of structural changes in cinema market research and a resulting reduction in trading volume.
The pre-tax discount rate of 15.0% used in this impairment calculation was also used in the prior year estimate of value in use.
Had the discount rate, tax rate or growth rate assumptions been varied within a range considered reasonably possible by management, no additional impairments would have arisen, except that TES goodwill would have been further impaired.
The projected cash flows used in the TES impairment calculation are managements best estimates, but are dependent on uncertain future events.
The company has no intangible fixed assets 2004 nil.
13 Acquisitions On 1 March 2005, the group acquired a 51% share of Interscience Informacao e Technologia Aplicada Ltda Interscience, a wellestablished Brazilian custom research business.
The group also acquired the business of Presse Plus, a French media intelligence business, on 25 May 2005.
A further 8% of the groups subsidiary in the Czech Republic, AISA, was purchased on 31 March 2005.
The acquisitions contributed revenues of 6.4m and operating profit of 1.4m to the group in the year to 31 December 2005.
If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2005, group revenue would have been 1,001.5m and operating profit would have been 99.8m.
As part of the acquisition of Interscience, the group has entered into put and call options to purchase the remaining 49% of the company.
The potential amounts payable, which are dependent on future performance, are estimated to be 2.2m and will be paid between 2006 and 2012.

All intangible assets acquired with the businesses have been recognised at their respective fair values separately from goodwill.
Each 2005 acquisition is considered to be a separate cash generating unit for the purpose of future impairment reviews.
Contingent deferred consideration previously recognised has been released during the year reducing goodwill by 0.3m.

Deferred consideration represents amounts that the group is contractually bound to pay in the future for acquisitions.
The amounts are determined by future results of the acquired businesses.
The provisions are determined with reference to the latest information available and are expected to be paid within one to three years of the balance sheet date.
Vacant property and onerous lease provisions represent the net rental cost to the group of empty leasehold properties and the net rent in excess of market rents for properties acquired with acquisitions to the end of the relevant lease periods.
The provisions are expected to be utilised by 2013.
Panel incentives represent amounts payable to panellists for their participation in panels research.
Amounts are estimated based on the value of incentives earned and are expected to be satisfied within one to two years.
Other provisions consist of liabilities arising as a result of ongoing litigation or claims and other amounts that are not individually material to the group.
The amounts are expected to be paid within one to five years.
No provisions were held by the company as at 31 December 2005 2004 nil.
22 Financial risk management and financial instruments The groups international operations and significant debt financing expose it to a range of financial risks that include changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and bank solvency credit ratings.
The group has a risk management policy to manage these financial risks over the short and medium term, to reduce volatility to earnings and shareholders funds and to aid future planning, by seeking to limit the impact of adverse movements in these variables.
The group holds foreign currency debt and uses interest rate and currency exchange rate financial instruments as part of this policy.
The board has delegated to a Financing Committee, chaired by the Finance Director, the responsibility for ensuring compliance with the groups financial risk management policy and on a semi-annual basis formally reviews this policy and its performance in delivering the boards objectives.
The group has a centralised treasury and financial risk function, which implements the risk management policy and it formally reports, on a monthly basis, the results of its activities and its compliance with the policy to the Financing Committee.
Group Treasury is not a profit centre and no speculative trades are permitted or executed.
Interest rate risk On 31 December 2005, the group had liquid resources of 45.8m 2004 63.3m held at floating rates and bank borrowings of 341.2m 2004 392.1m at floating rates.
It is therefore exposed to variations in primarily UK, US and Eurozone interest rates on these financial assets and liabilities.
The group has a policy of using financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements, to ensure that the level of effective fixed rate debt after the effect of these instruments is between 55% and 75% of total net debt.
At the year end 72.7% of net debt was at effective fixed rates.
74 TNS annual report 2005 22 Financial risk management and financial instruments continued Based on debt, interest rates and hedge levels existing at 31 December 2005, a 1% rise in interest rates before the effect of the interest rate hedge would increase the future annual interest charge as follows: on USD loans 2.1m, EUR 1.2m and GBP 0.2m.
A 1% rise in interest rates on a hedged basis would increase the annual interest charge as follows: USD 0.7m, EUR 0.6m and GBP nil.
A 1% decrease in interest rates would have the opposite effect in each case.
Currency risk The groups principal exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations arises on the translation of overseas earnings and net assets into sterling for accounting purposes and the sterling value of dividends paid up to the group.
The material foreign currencies in terms of earnings and net assets are the US dollar and Euro.
The group has a policy of holding a substantial amount of its bank debt in these currencies, to provide a natural hedge for currency earnings by currency interest payments and for currency net assets by the currency loan principal.
The policy ensures that the level of currency hedge debt and currency forwards where used should be greater than 75% and less than 100% of net assets for all currencies where net assets are greater than 10.0m.
The group uses forward currency contracts for hedging future certain and material dividend flows to the parent.
The group does have transactional foreign exchange exposure from sales and purchases of services between members of the group.
This is hedged initially by matching cash flows through a netting process, and finally by using forward currency contracts where material.
The level of net transactional exposure is currently not considered material.
Liquidity risk The group maintains sufficient facilities, both committed and uncommitted, to finance projected working capital and general corporate needs over the medium term.
The policy ensures that total drawings from all facilities is at all times less than 80% of total committed facilities and that the average maturity profile of committed facilities is greater than 18 months at any time.
At 31 December 2005, the average maturity profile of committed facilities was 3.6 years 2004 2.9 years, and 158.7m 2004 71.8m of these facilities and 37.8m 2004 52.0m of uncommitted facilities were undrawn and available to the group.
Credit and counterparty risk The group has liquid resources deposited and financial instruments with a range of financial institutions and is therefore exposed to credit solvency risk from these institutions.
The group has a policy which defines at which institutions funds can be placed and instruments dealt, and defines credit limits based on those institutions credit ratings.
The Financing Committee is responsible for approving new counterparties on a global basis and defining these limits.
Embedded derivatives Management has a policy of not entering into contracts that involve embedded derivatives.
The group has performed a review of contracts and has concluded that no embedded derivatives exist.
2004 comparative information As permitted by IFRS 1, financial instrument comparative information is reported in accordance with UK GAAP.
To achieve full compliance with IFRS recognition and measurement standards, the 2004 carrying value of financial instruments held to manage interest and currency exposure would have to be restated to fair value.
Hedge accounting and hedging gains and losses Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to the income statement, except where the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument.
The accounting treatment of derivatives classified as hedges depends on their designation.
The group designates derivatives either as a hedge of the income cost of a highly probable forecasted transaction or commitment cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The group is also required to document the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument and demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an on-going basis.
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end, to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Unrealised gains or losses on cash flow hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity.
Gains or losses deferred in equity are transferred to the income statement in the period which the forecast transaction affects the income statement.
Where the group hedges net investments in foreign entities through currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the translation of the borrowings are recognised in equity.
If the group uses derivatives as the hedging instrument for net investments, the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity, with any ineffective portion being recognised in the income statement.
The fair value of interest rate financial instruments is based on the market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward currency contracts has been determined based on market forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
the sixth sense of business 75 22 Financial instruments continued At 31 December 2005, there were net unrealised gains on interest rate cash flow hedges of 0.5m 2004 loss 1.2m.
During 2005 0.6m of gains on interest rate cash flow hedges were released from the cash flow hedge reserve and recognised in the interest charge.
All gains or losses on cash flow hedges were accounted for using hedge accounting.
The increase in the fair value relating to existing and new hedges during the year was 1.1m 2004 decrease of 0.8m.
Of the 0.5m of unrecognised gains on interest rate cash flow hedges at the end of the year, a 0.1m loss is expected to be recognised in the 2006 income statement and a 0.6m gain will be recognised in 2007.
As a central element of its risk management policy the group uses foreign currency debt to hedge its currency net assets, taking gains and losses on any residue net investment directly to reserves.
In 2005, this totalled a net gain of 6.0m 2004 loss of 8.4m.
All gains or losses on currency borrowings used as net investment hedges were accounted for using hedge accounting.
13.5m of net exchange losses on foreign currency debt 2004 10.3m gains have been taken to reserves to offset exchange gains 2004 losses on the equivalent net investment.
Net fair values of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges The net fair values of open instruments at the balance sheet date were: Assets Liabilities 2005 2004 2005 2004 m m m m Financial instruments held to manage interest rate exposure 1.2 0.6 0.7 1.8 Financial instruments held to manage currency exposure 0.5 0.3 0.2 Net fair values of currency borrowings designated as net investment hedges The group had both US dollar and euro denominated borrowings at the balance sheet date, which it has designated as a hedge for the net investment in its subsidiaries in the US and the Eurozone.
The fair value of the US dollar borrowings at 31 December 2005 was 199.3m 2004 172.7m and the Euro borrowings 117.0m 2004 190.3m.

The assets of all funded pension plans are held separately from those of the group, and full actuarial valuations are performed at least every three years.
Contributions in 2006 are expected to be consistent with 2005 levels.
UK The pension plans in the UK are primarily defined contribution plans and the groups contribution to such plans ranges from 4% to 8% of salary, rising with the age of employees.
At the year end there were 0.2m 2004 0.2m of outstanding contributions.
There are also two defined benefit final salary plans, which are closed to new members and future accruals.
Independent qualified actuaries performed full valuations for these in 2004 and 2005 using the projected unit method, details of which are given below.
France Companies in France participate in compulsory state arrangements.
Regulations in France require that a lump sum be paid to employees on retirement, based on their final salary and the number of years service.
During 2004, the regulations and benefits were changed and the state retirement age was increased from 60 to 65.
The impact of the changes is being spread over the service life of the employees.
The provisions required to meet these amounts were assessed by independent qualified actuaries in 2005 and details of their valuations are provided below.
US The group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit final salary pension plans in the US.
At the year end, there were 0.1m 2004 0.1m of outstanding contributions in relation to the defined contribution plans.
Unfunded post retirement healthcare and life assurance plans are also operated, which at 31 December contributed 1.5m 2004 3.9m to the total US defined benefit pension obligation disclosed below.
During the year, plan rules were changed to reduce the level of benefits available under these plans, resulting in an exceptional curtailment gain in the income statement.
All defined benefit plans, and the healthcare and life assurances plans, have been valued by independent qualified actuaries in 2004 and 2005 and details are given in aggregate below.
78 TNS annual report 2005 23 Retirement benefit obligations continued Netherlands The Dutch defined benefit final salary plan operated by the group is insured, although indexation increases to pensions in payment remain the responsibility of the company.
Provision for these indexation increases is made based on actuarial assessments made by independent qualified actuaries in 2004 and 2005, using the projected unit method.
An early retirement plan was also available to employees in prior years, but was discontinued in 2005 following regulatory changes, resulting in another exceptional curtailment credit to the income statement.
Other countries Where there are local requirements to provide lump sum payments and other post employments benefits, provision has been made for the liabilities identified based on local actuarial assessments.
Details of these arrangements are given in aggregate in the following pages.

December 2005 by independent qualified actuaries from the full actuarial valuation detailed above by country.
The expected return on bonds and other investments reflects bond yields at the balance sheet date and the nature of the investments held.
Expected returns on equities reflect the expectation that equities will out-perform fixed interest government bonds by 3% to 4% per annum.

Additionally, all employees can elect to participate in a Save As You Earn SAYE scheme.
For grants during 2005 the fair value was estimated using either the Black-Scholes-Merton model or the Monte Carlo model, and is charged to the income statement over the minimum life of the grants.
The Black-Scholes-Merton model was selected to value options and to value performance shares granted with EPS performance criteria because the grants are not complex in nature and the method is straightforward to use.
This model values such grants as if they were tradeable options, and generates a single outcome using the assumptions noted below, which can then be adjusted to reflect estimates of lapsing due to non-achievement of performance criteria or employee decisions.
The Monte Carlo model was selected to value shares granted with performance criteria based on the Total Shareholder Return of TNS relative to other companies because these are market based criteria and require simulation of multiple possible outcomes to derive an estimated value.
This model values such options by simulating 50,000 possible outcomes for TNS and each company in the comparator group, calculating the expected gain for each simulated outcome and discounting the average of these gains to give a present value.
This valuation already includes the probability of lapsing due to non-achievement of performance criteria.
The fair values per option granted during the year and the key assumptions used are as follows: New LTIP New LTIP ESP EPP 2001 LTIP WESP EPS TSR Grant date April April April May October October Valuation model BSM BSM BSM BSM BSM Monte Carlo Share price at grant date 230.3p 230.3p 230.3p 217.0p 201.8p 201.8p Exercise price 227.5p 75.0p 188.9p Expected volatility based on 3 or 5 year historical volatility 34.8% 34.8% 34.8% 34.8% 34.8% 32.1% Average expected period to exercise years 433533 Risk free rate yield on zero-coupon government bonds 4.2% 4.2% 4.2% 4.2% 4.2% 4.2% Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 1.5% 1.5% 1.5% 1.6% 1.7% 1.7% Fair value per share 68.7p 220.2p 154.7p 102.2p 191.7p Monte Carlo fair value per share including probability of lapsing 76.9p The total charge for the year relating to employee share based payment plans was 4.5m 2004 2.6m, all of which related to equity-settled share based payment transactions.
After deferred tax, the total charge was 3.7m 2004 2.1m.
During the year to 31 December 2005 the group issued 902,003 shares with a market value of 2.1m in deferred consideration for its acquisition of Area Investigacion SA 2004 nil.
25 Options and rights in shares of the company At 31 December 2005, the ESOP trust held 0.2 million ordinary 5p shares in the company 2004 0.7m.

At 31 December 2005, the EBT held 4.7m ordinary 5p shares in the company 2004 6.2m.
Of those, 0.7m 2004 1.9m have had rights granted over them under the Long Term Incentive Plan and a further 1.5m 2004 1.4m under other plans.
Shares over which options have not yet been granted had a market value at 31 December 2005 of 6.1m 2004 7.0m.
Shares held through the ESOP trust are shown as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds, which have thereby been reduced by 7.3m 2004 8.5m.
Profits or losses arising on the disposal of shares following the exercise of share options relating to the EBT are taken to other reserves in the consolidated financial statements.
Options exercised in 2005 resulted in 2,333,721 shares being issued at 0.96 each 2004: 3,231,225 shares at 0.93 each.
The related weighted average price at the time of exercise was 2.16 2004: 2.11 per share.
At 31 December 2005, the options detailed below had been granted and were still outstanding in respect of the companys shares under company share option plans.
The exercise of options under the Executive Share Option Scheme, the Savings Related Share Option Plan and the WESP may require the issue of new shares.
The long-term incentive plans and equity participation plan use shares held by the ESOP and EBT trusts.
Since 31 December 2005, 820,312 shares have been issued to satisfy a further 2.1 million of deferred consideration in relation to the purchase of Area Investigacin SA.

32 Reconciliation of IFRS financial statements to previously reported UK GAAP financial statements TNS reported under UK GAAP in its previously published financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The analysis below shows a reconciliation of net assets and profit as reported under UK GAAP as at 31 December 2004 to the revised total equity and profit under IFRS as reported in these financial statements.
In addition, there is a reconciliation of net assets under UK GAAP to IFRS at the transition date for the company, being 1 January 2004.
The adoption of IFRS has resulted in changes to the groups accounting policies that have affected the amounts reported for the current or prior years in the following areas: Share based payments The fair value of share options granted to employees is estimated for each grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton and Monte Carlo models and charged to the income statement over the minimum life of the options.
This IFRS charge replaces the UITF 17 revised charge for options issued at below market value previously recognised.
TNS has elected to apply recognition and measurement requirements only to equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
88 TNS annual report 2005 Goodwill In place of amortisation, under IFRS all goodwill is subjected to an annual impairment test.
Any impairment identified is charged immediately to the income statement.
Negative goodwill will be written off immediately to the income statement.
Any fair value adjustments made to goodwill in a later financial year allowed up to 12 months from the date of acquisition are reflected as a restatement of the prior year accounts.
Employment benefits Defined benefit plan assets and liabilities are recorded in the balance sheet with actuarial gains and losses taken to reserves.
Previously, assets and liabilities were not recorded and the costs of plans were charged to the income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over the service lives of employees in the plans.
Under the IFRS transitional arrangements, TNS has elected to recognise the cumulative actuarial loss at 1 January 2004 as a movement in equity.
Joint ventures Under IFRS, joint ventures are consolidated on a proportionate basis with the groups share of assets and liabilities, profit and loss and cash flows being reflected in the group financial statements.
Previously, joint ventures were shown within investments, with the groups share of operating profit, interest and tax shown in the financial statements.
Joint venture cash flows were not included in the group cash flow statement.
Associates Under IFRS, losses from an associate in excess of the groups interest in that associate are no longer recognised where there is no contractual obligation to fund those losses.
Under UK GAAP, losses were recognised even if in excess of the groups interest in the associate.
Deferred tax IFRS requires deferred tax to be provided for in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they can be utilised against future taxable profits.
Where goodwill is deductible against tax, a deferred tax liability is required even if such a liability would only unwind on the eventual sale of the business in question.
Dividends As required under IFRS, dividends are recognised when approved or paid, not when declared.
Financial instruments As permitted by IFRS 1, First Time Adoption of IFRS, the IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement rules on hedge accounting have been applied from 1 January 2005.
TNS continues to report financial instruments for the 2004 comparative year in accordance with UK GAAP.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets IFRS requires that, for acquisitions made since 1 January 2004, certain intangible assets are recognised separately to reflect the fair value of brands, customer lists, or other intangibles acquired.
Previously they would have been included in goodwill.
These intangibles are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Software, previously included within tangible fixed assets, is classified as an intangible fixed asset under IFRS.
Business combinations Business combinations prior to the transition date of 1 January 2004 have not been restated.
Cumulative translation differences TNS has reset the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to nil as at 1 January 2004.
Company income statement reconciliation The companys 2004 previously reported profit for the year after dividends under UK GAAP was 5.7m.
This has been adjusted to remove the dividend charge for the year of 15.4m and the UITF 17 revised charge of 0.8m included under UK GAAP, and to include 5.4m of foreign exchange losses previously recognised through equity, resulting in a profit for the year under IFRS of 16.5m.
