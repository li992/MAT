46 BRIXTON u NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 Statement of significant accounting policies a Statement of compliance The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
Disclosures required by IFRS 1: First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are set out in note 34. b Basis of accounts The accounts are presented in sterling and amounts are disclosed rounded to the nearest 100,000, unless otherwise indicated.
The accounting policies set out below, except for those relating to the classification and measurement of financial instruments, have been consistently applied to all periods presented in these accounts.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption available under IFRS 1 and applied IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 January 2005 only.
No comparative figures have been restated for the impact of these standards.
If they had been applied to prior years the fair value of the interest rate derivatives of the Group at 31 December 2004 would have been recognised at that date as a liability of 9.3m, with a related deferred tax asset of 2.8m.
Financing costs for the year ended 31 December 2004 would have included a profit of 7.8m, being the movement in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, and the deferred tax charge would have included a related tax charge of 2.3m.
In addition, the impact of adoption of IAS 32 and 39 within the Groups joint venture partnerships would have resulted in a reduction in the Groups net investment in joint ventures of 1.0m for 2004, and a reduction in the Groups share of joint venture profits of the same amount.
A related deferred tax credit of 0.3m and a deferred tax asset of 0.3m would also have been recognised.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future that may affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of these accounts are reasonable.
However, actual outcomes may differ from those anticipated.
c Basis of consolidation The Group accounts incorporate the results of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December each year.
Control is assumed where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are included in the Group income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate.
All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.
d Investment in joint ventures Joint ventures are those entities over which the Group exerts joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The Group accounts for its investments in its jointly controlled entities using the equity method of accounting.
Under this method the investment is initially recorded at cost and is subsequently adjusted to reflect the Groups share of the net profit or loss of the joint venture.
The Groups share of joint venture results is included in a single line item in the income statement.
e Goodwill On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Goodwill is carried in the balance sheet at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
The balance is reviewed for impairment at least annually with impairment being recognised immediately in the income statement.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
On disposal of a subsidiary or a property disposal, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
f Investment properties Investment properties are properties owned or leased under finance leases by the Group which are held either for long-term rental income or for capital appreciation or both.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost including related transaction costs and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined by professionally qualified external valuers.
The basis of valuation of properties is described in note 12.
In accordance with IAS 40: Investment Property, investment property held under a finance lease is stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are included in the income statement of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS 40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties including integral plant.
Additions to investment properties consist of costs of a capital nature and, in the case of investment properties under development, capitalised interest, certain internal staff and associated costs directly attributable to the management of the developments under construction.
When the Group redevelops an existing investment property for continued future use as an investment property, the property remains an investment property measured at fair value through the income statement.
47 BRIXTON 1 Statement of significant accounting policies continued Borrowing costs associated with direct expenditure on investment properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised using the Groups weighted average cost of the relevant borrowings.
Interest is capitalised from the commencement of the development work until the date when the property is physically complete and becomes available for occupation.
The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted.
g Plant and equipment Plant and equipment comprise computers, motor vehicles, furniture, fixtures and fittings and improvements to Group offices.
These assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
h Other investments Investments are initially measured at cost.
At subsequent reporting dates those investments for which a fair value can be ascertained are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity.
Other investments are held at cost.
i Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is considered impaired and written down accordingly.
j Leases Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction.
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee is classified as a finance lease.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group as a lessee In accordance with IAS 40, leases of investment property are assessed on a property by property basis.
The Groups investment properties are accounted for as finance leases and are recognised as an asset and an obligation to pay future minimum lease payments.
The investment property asset is included in the balance sheet at fair value, gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Lease payments, where material, are allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate.
Other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Group as lessor Assets leased out under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the net investment in the leases.
Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant rate of return on net investment.
Assets leased out under operating leases are included in investment property, with rental income recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Benefits granted as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
k Financial instruments Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised at invoiced value less provisions for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the agreed terms of the receivables concerned.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits with banks, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, net of bank overdrafts.
Interest bearing borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are non-interest bearing and are recognised at invoiced amount.
Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps in order to manage the risks arising from its activities as described in more detail in the Financial Review on pages 22 to 25 and in note 19.
From 1 January 2005 derivatives are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured to fair value as calculated by the counterparties based on market prices.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting to its derivative financial instruments and hence any change in the fair value of such derivatives is recognised immediately in the income statement as a finance cost.
48 BRIXTON u NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 Statement of significant accounting policies continued l Pension costs The obligations of defined benefit pension schemes, representing benefits accruing to employees, are measured at discounted present value while scheme assets are measured at their fair value.
The discount rate used is the yield on AA credit rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are spread systematically over the working lives of the employees concerned and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from either experience differing from previous actuarial assumptions or changes to those assumptions are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are expensed as incurred.
m Revenue recognition Revenue comprises rental income, service charges and other recoveries from tenants of the Groups investment properties.
Rental income from investment property leased out under an operating lease is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the net consideration for the use of the property and are therefore also recognised on the same, straight-line basis.
Surrender premiums received in the period from tenants vacating the property before the end of the lease are included in rental income.
A property is regarded as sold when the significant risks and returns have been transferred to the buyer, which is normally on unconditional exchange of contracts.
For conditional exchanges, sales are recognised as the conditions are satisfied.
n Share and share-based remuneration The cost of equity settled transactions with employees and Directors is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised in the income statement as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the individuals concerned become fully entitled to the award.
The charge is reversed if it appears likely that the performance criteria will not be met.
The fair value of share options awarded has been calculated by New Bridge Street Consultants, using a stochastic option valuation model.
o Income tax The charge for current UK corporation tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences, except in respect of investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
It is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
p Exceptional items Non-recurring expenses and gains recognised outside the normal course of business are classified as exceptional and are identified separately in the financial statements.
49 BRIXTON 2 Net rental income The Group engages in only one class of business activity, being property investment.
All operations are continuing and are located in the UK.
The Group disposed of its entire office portfolio in the first half of 2005.
All remaining properties held at 31 December 2005 are industrial in nature.

3 Exceptional administration expenses Exceptional administration expenses in 2005 represent costs of 1.5m incurred in relation to the corporate restructuring following the acquisition of Industrious.
Exceptional administration costs of 1.0m in 2004 arose from the corporate re-organisation undertaken during that year.
4 Profit arising on sale of properties The profit arising on sale of properties is calculated by reference to book value at the date of sale.
The profit arising on sale of properties in 2005 also included an exceptional goodwill impairment charge of 6.9m for goodwill attached to properties disposed 2004: nil.

At 31 December 2005 the notional amount outstanding under fixed interest rate receivable swaps was 635m comprised as follows: i In February 2001, the Company entered into three fixed interest rate receivable swaps totalling 100m in order to swap the 2010 100m tap issue into floating rate.
Through the use of swaps, floors and swaptions the issue was swapped into floating rate at an average of LIBOR 70bp until the maturity of the bond in December 2010.
The notional principal on the floors sold was 100m at an average strike rate of 3.70% up to December 2005 and 3.96% thereafter.
ii In November 2001, the Company entered into three fixed interest rate receivable swaps totalling 75m in order to swap the 2010 75m tap issue into floating rate.

v On 28 February 2005 a 7.625% 2023 Debenture, acquired with the purchase of the Industrious group was cancelled in exchange for a tap issue of the 6% 2019 Bonds, resulting in 60m of Bonds being issued.
On 10 March 2005 the 60m of Bonds were swapped into floating rate using two fixed rate receivable interest rate swaps totalling 60m.
Through the use of swaps, floors and swaptions the issue was swapped into floating rate at an average of LIBOR 54.875bp until the maturity of the bond in September 2019.
The notional principal on the floors sold is 60m, with a strike rate set so that if six month LIBOR on any fixing date during the term of the swap is set below 2.75% the LIBOR rate for that six month period is 3.75%.
vi On 23 September 2005 the Company swapped the 150m bond issue of 22 September 2005 into floating rate using three fixed rate receivable interest rate swaps totalling 150m.
Through the use of swaps, floors and swaptions the issue was swapped into floating rate at an average of LIBOR 27.75bp until the maturity of the bond in October 2015.
The notional principal on the floors sold was 150m with a strike rate set so that if six month LIBOR on any fixing date during the term of the swap is set below 2.75% the LIBOR rate for that six month period is 3.75%.
59 BRIXTON 19 Derivative financial instruments continued In 2001, the Company entered into a 50m swaption under which it receives 42.5bp per annum until December 2010.
This amount reduces the coupon on 50m of the original 100m bond issued in February 1999.
Under the swaption, the counterparty has the right to enter into a 10-year swap starting in 2010 at a fixed rate of 4.95%.
At 31 December 2005 the Company had a 225m swap at an average fixed rate of interest payable of 3.9475% until July 2009, subject to the right of the counterparty to cancel the swap after July 2006 at nil cost to the Group.
The effect of these swaps is included in the interest rate analysis in note 17.
The fair value of swaps entered into at 31 December 2005 is set out in note 20.
These amounts are based on market values at the balance sheet dates.

The Groups only obligation is to repay its debentures, bonds and loans at par value on the maturity dates.
Sterling loans of 91.2m 2004: 91.9m have been made by Group companies to joint ventures.
These loans are not interest bearing and the return is dependent on the overall return from the partnerships.
It is therefore not practical to determine the fair value of these loans.

31 Pension costs Defined contribution schemes The Group operates two defined contribution pension schemes for employees through which it pays contributions to personal pensions established with specific providers.
Assets of the pension schemes are held separately from those of Group companies, being invested with insurance companies.
Contributions payable to these schemes by the Group, at rates specified in the rules of the plans, totalled 0.3m 2004: 0.2m.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates two funded defined benefit pension schemes.
The main scheme, the Brixton Scheme, is non-contributory for members and provides benefits based on final pensionable salary.
Contributions, payable by the Company, were invested in a Managed Fund Contract with Clerical Medical Investment Group Limited Clerical during 2005.
Following a review of the investment manager arrangements, Legal & General Assurance Pensions Management Limited have replaced Clerical Medical as investment managers for the Brixton Scheme.
The transfer of assets to Legal & Generals pooled investment funds was completed during February 2006.
The scheme was effectively closed to new entrants on 1 January 1998.
The most recent actuarial valuation of plan assets and of the present value of the defined benefit obligation for the Brixton Scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2003 by a qualified actuary.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the attained age method.
66 BRIXTON u NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 31 Pension costs continued Defined benefit schemes continued A subsidiary of the Company also operates a defined benefit pension scheme, the Industrious Scheme, in respect of employees who transferred with the Industrious Target Group during the year.
This scheme provides benefits based on final pensionable salary and was closed to new entrants on 2 July 1999.
Contributions are invested in funds managed by Scottish Equitable plc.
The most recent actuarial valuation of plan assets and of the present value of the defined benefit obligation for the Industrious Scheme was carried out as at 1 July 2004 by a qualified actuary.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The valuations for both schemes have been updated using the projected unit credit method to 31 December 2005 by a qualified independent actuary.

ii IAS 12: Income taxes Deferred tax is provided on investment property valuations and movements are included in the income statement.
Under UK GAAP the contingent capital gains tax that would be payable if all investment properties were sold for their balance sheet value was disclosed as a note and not recognised in the balance sheet.
iii IAS 31: Interest in joint ventures Brixton has taken the option available under IAS 31 to equity account for its joint ventures.
Its share of joint ventures profit after tax is therefore reported as a single line in the income statement and its share of the net assets of joint ventures are included in a single line on the balance sheet.
iv IAS 17: leases In accordance with IAS 17, interests in leasehold properties have been assessed on a property by property basis and have been classified as finance leases under IFRS.
The obligation to the lessor is included within non-current liabilities, calculated as the present value of the minimum lease payments, and a corresponding headlease asset is included within investment property.
Letting costs of developments and investment properties are capitalised and amortised over the lease term under IFRS, whereas under UK GAAP the former were capitalised and the latter were written off as incurred.
v SIC 15: Operating leases: incentives The cost of lease incentives given to tenants or granted as a tenant under operating leases is spread over the term of the lease under IFRS rather than, as under UK GAAP, to the first rent review.
vi IAS 19: Employee benefits The Groups net obligation as in respect of defined benefit pension plans as recognised in the balance sheet represents the amount of future benefit earned by employees, discounted to its present value, less the fair value of the pension plan assets.
Service costs, the expected return on pension scheme assets and interest on pension scheme liabilities are charged in arriving at profit before tax, while experience gains and losses are taken directly to equity.
The Group has adopted the amendment to IAS 19 published in December 2004 permitting the immediate recognition of actuarial gains and losses directly in equity.
vii IFRS 2: Share based payments IFRS 2 requires the cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration to employees and Directors to be recognised through the income statement at its fair value.
The cost is spread over the vesting period and is adjusted only to reflect changes in the expected number of shares vesting.
viii IAS 10: Events after the balance sheet date IAS 10 states that only liabilities actually existing at the balance sheet date are to be provided for.
Unapproved dividends and interim dividends not paid by the balance sheet date, accordingly, are not provided for.
Under IFRS dividends are not recognised in the income statement, but are considered a deduction from equity and are hence included in the reconciliation of changes in equity in note 26.
