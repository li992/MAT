Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 1 Accounting policies The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented except for those relating to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
The Group has made use of the exemption available under IFRS 1 to only apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005.
The policies applied to financial instruments for 2004 and 2005 are disclosed separately below.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates, assumptions and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Significant judgements were made in relation to inventory, trade and other receivables, deferred taxation, post retirement benefits and provisions, the accounting policies for which are set out below.
New accounting standards and amendments to existing standards that have been published and are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted, are as follows: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures.
IFRS 7 introduces new disclosures about financial instruments.
It requires the disclosure of information about exposure to risks arising from financial instruments, including specified minimum disclosures about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, including sensitivity analysis to market risk.
It replaces the disclosure requirements in IAS 32.
The amendment to IAS 1 introduces disclosures about the level of an entitys capital and how it manages capital.
Amendment to IAS 19 Employee benefits.
The amendment requires additional disclosure to provide information about plan assets and liabilities and the assumptions underlying the components of the defined benefit cost.
i Basis of preparation The financial information in this report has been prepared on the basis of accounting policies set out below in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as well as those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Prior to 2005, the Group prepared its audited annual financial statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the UK UK GAAP.
For the year ended 31 December 2005, the Group is required to prepare its annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting standards adopted for use in the European Union, IFRS.
As such, these financial statements take account of the requirements and options in IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards as they relate to the 2004 comparatives included therein.
A company is generally required to determine its IFRS accounting policies as at its reporting date and apply these retrospectively to determine its opening balance sheet at its date of transition to IFRS 1 January 2004.
IFRS 1 allows a number of exemptions to this general principle to assist companies in their transition.
The following key exemptions have been taken:- Business combinations IFRS 3 : Business combinations prior to the transition date 1 January 2004 have not been restated onto an IFRS basis.
Fair value as deemed cost: Certain properties have been fair valued at the transition date and this will become the deemed cost.
Employee benefits: All cumulative actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in equity at the transition date.
Cumulative translation differences: The cumulative translation difference arising on the retranslation of foreign currency denominated entities has been set at zero at the transition date.
The gain or loss on a subsequent disposal of any such entity shall exclude translation differences that arose before the date of transition to IFRS but shall include later translation differences.
Share-based payments IFRS 2 : Equity settled transactions arising from grants prior to 7 November 2002 have not been accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 2.
Financial instruments IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement : The comparative information for 2004 for derivatives, financial assets and financial liabilities and hedging relationships has not been restated to comply with IAS 32 and IAS 39.
The adjustments required on the adoption of IAS 39 as set out in note 31 were established at 1 January 2005 and recognised at that date.
An explanation of how transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the Groups financial position, income statement and cash flows is set out in note 30 and note 31.
Use of adjusted measures To help provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance, items which are both material and non-recurring are presented as exceptional items.
The amount of foreign currency exchange differences on inter-company loans included in the income statement is determined by reference to movements in exchange rates and therefore this amount is likely to be volatile.
IFRS adjusted earnings per share excludes exceptional items and foreign currency exchange differences on inter-company loans.
ii Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity.
A shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights will normally be the basis of such control.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
50 Charter plc Annual Report 2005 1 Accounting policies continued ii Basis of consolidation continued The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus the costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired, including all separately identifiable intangible assets, is goodwill which has been recorded as an intangible asset since 1 January 1998 see Goodwill below.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, normally on the basis of a shareholding of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded at cost.
The Groups share of its associates post acquisition profits or losses, net of interest and tax, is recognised in the income statement and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves.
Inter-company balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains arising from inter-company transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The Group has taken advantage of the business combinations exemption in IFRS 1 and has not restated business combinations that took place before 1 January 2004. iii Segmental reporting The Groups primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments.
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products that are subject to risks and returns that are different from other business segments.
Segmental assets comprise total assets excluding income tax assets.
Segmental liabilities comprise total liabilities excluding income tax liabilities and borrowings other than bank overdrafts.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
iv Foreign currencies Items included in the financial statements for each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, the functional currency and presentation currency of Charter plc.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of group entities using the exchange rate at the date of transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement.
The results and net assets of all group companies that have non-Sterling functional currency are included in the consolidated financial statements as follows:- a Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date: b Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the relevant period: and c All resulting exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to shareholders equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
v Financial instruments IAS 32 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation, and IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement, have been adopted with effect from 1 January 2005.
The comparative information for 2004 has been prepared in accordance with the Groups IFRS accounting policies for financial instruments applicable up to 31 December 2004.
Both policies are set out below.
a IFRS accounting policies applicable from 1 January 2005 Derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps, are used as hedges in the financing and financial risk management of the Group and are initially measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1 hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities fair value hedge : 2 hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedge : or 3 hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the consolidated income statement together with any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
For cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement.
When hedged cash flows result in the recognition of a non financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in shareholders equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in shareholders equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement.
For net investment hedges gains and losses accumulated in shareholders equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are recognised in the income statement.
Borrowings are measured at amortised cost.
Where borrowings are used to hedge the Groups interest in the net assets of foreign operations, the portion of the gain or loss on the borrowings that are determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity.
Gains and losses accumulated in shareholders equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
b IFRS accounting policies applicable up to 31 December 2004 Forward foreign exchange contracts which hedge forecast transactions were not recognised until the transaction they hedge was itself recognised.
Where foreign currency borrowings were used to hedge the Groups interest in the net assets of foreign operations, the portion of the gain or loss on the borrowings that were determined to be an effective hedge was recognised in shareholders equity.
Charter plc Annual Report 2005 51 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued vi Property, plant and equipment The Groups policy is to carry property, plant and equipment at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses except that certain properties were revalued on transition to IFRS at 1 January 2004.
These revaluations are treated as deemed cost as at 1 January 2004 as allowed by IFRS 1.
In accordance with the benchmark treatment under IFRS, borrowing costs associated with expenditure on property, plant and equipment are not capitalised.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line method spreading the difference between cost and residual value over the estimated useful life as follows:- Buildings 30-50 years Plant, machinery and equipment 8-14 years Vehicles 5 years IT equipment 3-5 years The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount see Impairment of assets below.
vii Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary or associate acquired.
Goodwill, represented by the carrying value at 1 January 2004 under the Groups previous accounting policy together with additional amounts arising since that date is no longer amortised and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, and is included in intangible assets in relation to subsidiaries and in investments in associates in relation to associates.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the classification and accounting treatment of business combinations has not been restated on transition to IFRS, as permitted by IFRS 1.
Goodwill arising prior to 1 January 1998 was written off directly to reserves.
Goodwill arising in the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2003 was capitalised as an intangible asset in relation to subsidiaries and amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, a period not exceeding 20 years or included as part of the carrying value of associates.
b Research and development Research expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal development expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred, unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets, in which case such costs are capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life of the asset created, usually between three and ten years.
c Computer software Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the license, usually between 3 and 5 years.
Internal expenditure associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred, except such costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group that are likely to generate benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, in which case such costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software product, usually less than 3 years.
viii Impairment of assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
ix Inventory Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in first-out FIFO basis or the average cost basis.
Cost includes expenditure which is incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the product to its present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less all disposal costs to be incurred.
x Assets held for sale Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable within one year from the date of classification.
Assets classified for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and cease to be depreciated from the date of classification.
xi Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
xii Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
xiii Taxation Taxation is that chargeable on the profits for the period, together with deferred taxation.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Deferred taxation liabilities are provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
52 Charter plc Annual Report 2005 1 Accounting policies continued xiii Taxation continued Deferred taxation is not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the resulting temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future or where the remittance would not give rise to incremental tax liabilities or is otherwise not taxable.
xiv Employee benefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar post retirement benefits principally healthcare under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
In respect of defined benefit pension plans, where the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement is defined by the plan, the liability recorded in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined obligation at that date less the fair value of the plan assets, together with an adjustment for any unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
As permitted under IFRS 1 all actuarial gains and losses as at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, were recognised for each plan.
To the extent that cumulative actuarial gains and losses arising subsequent to 1 January 2004 exceed 10 per cent of the higher of plan assets or liabilities as at the end of the previous year, this excess is normally amortised in the income statement over the expected average remaining working lives of the employees participating in the plan.
Otherwise, the accumulated actuarial gains and losses are not recognised.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period, in which case the past service costs are spread over that period.
For defined benefit schemes, the amount charged to operating profit in the income statement comprises the current service cost, interest on plan liabilities, the expected return on plan assets, past service cost, the impact of any settlements or curtailments and actuarial gains or losses to the extent they are recognised.
For defined contribution plans, where the Group pays fixed contribution into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions irrespective of whether or not the fund has sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to service in the current and prior periods, the contributions are recognised as an expense when they are due.
For other defined benefit post retirement obligations, principally post retirement medical arrangements in the US, a similar accounting methodology to that for defined benefit pension plans is used.
Where the actuarial valuation of a scheme demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognised asset is limited to the extent that the Group can benefit in future, for example, by refunds or a reduction in contributions.
xv Share-based payments The Group operates both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the income statement.
In the case of equity-settled plans the fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
This expense is spread over the vesting period of the instrument.
The corresponding entry is credited to equity.
The liability for social security costs arising in relation to the awards is re-measured at each reporting date based on the share price as at the reporting date and the elapsed portion of the relevant vesting periods to the extent it is considered probable that a liability will arise.
Cash settled plans are measured on a similar basis except that the fair value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date, with changes recognised in the income statement.
For cash-settled plans the corresponding entry is included as a liability.
xvi Government grants Grants receivable from governments or similar bodies are credited to the balance sheet in the period in which the conditions relating to the grant are met.
Where they relate to specific assets they are amortised on a straight line basis over the same period as the asset is depreciated.
Where they relate to revenue expenditure and or non-asset criteria they are taken to the income statement to match the period in which the expenditure is incurred and criteria met.
xvii Provisions Provisions for disposal and restructuring costs, warranty and product liability, and legal and environmental liability are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
If all these conditions are not met then no provision is recognised.
Incurred but not reported amounts IBNR are included in provisions.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
If the effect of discounting is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected value of future cash flows at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
xviii Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the invoiced value of goods and services and the value of work executed during the year in respect of long-term contracts.
Revenue, which is recorded net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts, and after eliminating intra-group sales, is recognised as follows: a Sales of goods and services The majority of the Groups revenues relate to the sale of goods and services which are recognised when a group entity has fulfilled its contractual obligations to a customer and has obtained the right to receive consideration.
In respect of the sale of goods this is usually on despatch but is dependent upon the contractual terms that have been agreed with a customer.
b Construction contracts Revenue is recognised by a group entity in accordance with the stage of completion of its contractual obligations to the customer.
The stage of completion is usually based on the proportion of costs incurred compared to the total expected costs to complete the contract, where this also represents a right to receive consideration, and provided the outcome of the contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period in which the loss first becomes foreseeable.
Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract.
xix Leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset had been purchased outright.
The assets are included in property, plant and equipment and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as an obligation under finance leases.
The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest repayment elements.
The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element charged to income so as to give a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance outstanding at each accounting period.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
xx Dividends Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Charter plc Annual Report 2005 53 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Segment analysis Primary reporting format business segments The Group is organised into two principal businesses, ESAB welding, cutting and automation and Howden air and gas handling.
For the purposes of IAS 14, ESAB is analysed into two segments: i welding and ii cutting and automation.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of 2,208,746 2004: 497,819 dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long term incentive plans.
To help provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance, exceptional items and foreign currency gains and losses on inter-company loans including attributable tax are excluded from the calculations of adjusted earnings per share as set out in the following table.

The carrying amounts of goodwill have been allocated as follows: 2005 2004 m m Welding Alcotec single CGU 10.4 10.4 ESAB Sp z. o. o single CGU 5.8 5.8 Eutectic single CGU 0.9 0.9 ESAB South America several CGUs 15.1 0.4 32.2 17.5 Air and Gas Handling Howden South Africa several CGUs 0.9 0.9 33.1 18.4 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected sales prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and internal forecasts.
Selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next two years and extrapolates cash flows for the following years based on estimated growth rates of 5 per cent.
This does not exceed the average long term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows were 11.6 to 20.5 per cent.
Other intangible assets have finite lives, over which the assets are amortised.
The amortisation periods are set out in the accounting policies on page 52.
Amortisation has been included in the income statement as follows: Computer software Development costs Total 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 m m m m m m Cost of sales 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.2 0.7 0.7 Selling and distribution costs Administrative expenses 0.4 0.4 0.1 0.5 0.4 Total 0.9 0.9 0.3 0.2 1.2 1.1 Development costs are amortised once the asset is brought into use.

This is expected to result in cash expenditure in 2006.
The remaining provisions in this category are expected to be utilised over the next one to two years.
ii Warranty and product liability provisions relate to continuing businesses and are expected to be utilised over a period of one to two years dependent on the warranty period provided but will also be replaced by comparable amounts as they are utilised.
iii Provision has been made for the probable exposure arising from legal and environmental claims and disputes, both existing and threatened, in some cases arising from warranties given on disposal of businesses.
Provisions have been made representing the best estimate of the outcome of the claims including costs before taking account of insurance recoveries.
Where the outcome of a claim is uncertain the legal costs of defence have been provided for to the extent that they are reliably measurable.
Where appropriate insurance recoveries are recognised in receivables.
At 31 December 2005 these amounted to 1.7 million.
If the effect of discounting is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected value of future cash flows at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specified to the liability.
Due to their nature, it is not possible to predict precisely when these provisions will be utilised though most are expected to be utilised over the short to medium term with utilisation in the next year expected to be in the region of 10 million.
iv Other provisions include various amounts which are not individually material.
Due to their nature it is not possible to predict precisely when these provisions will be utilised but utilisation in the next year is expected to be in the region of 1 million to 2 million.
v The opening balances as at 1 January 2005 for legal & environmental and other provisions are after reclassifying 3.3 million from trade and other payables following further consideration of the classification requirements of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

The Group also provides post retirement medical benefits in the United States.
As explained in note 30, in accordance with the transitional rules in IFRS 1 all cumulative surpluses and deficits were recognised in the balance sheet at 1 January 2004.
Subsequent to that date IAS 19 allows a smoothing approach in which some of the movement in surpluses and deficits is deferred and recognised over time commencing in the following accounting period the corridor approach.

The valuation of United Kingdom and overseas defined benefit pension schemes and the liability for United States post retirement medical benefit liabilities is assessed by professionally qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.

Based on the rates used, a member who retires at age 60 will live on average for a further 24 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 27 years after retirement if they are female.
For the principal overseas schemes, the mortality assumptions have been derived from the RP2000 table United States, the P94 tables Sweden and the Heubeck 2005 G Tables Germany.
The main actuarial assumption for the United States post retirement medical benefits is the long term increase in health costs of 5 per cent a year 2004: 5 per cent.
21 Financial instruments and risk management a Treasury management Charters central treasury department is responsible for ensuring the availability and flexibility of funding arrangements in order to meet the ongoing requirements of the Group.
In addition, it is responsible for managing the interest rate risks, liquidity risks and balance sheet foreign exchange translation risks of the Group.
Foreign exchange transaction exposures are generally managed directly by operating subsidiaries within strict guidelines and controls established by their divisional management and overseen by group treasury.
It is the Groups policy not to hedge profit and loss account translation exposure.
b Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mix of equity and borrowings.
Borrowings are made in the desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
It is the Groups objective to minimise the cost of borrowings whilst retaining the flexibility of funding opportunities.
When considered appropriate, the Group uses interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and collars and forward rate agreements to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
c Currency risks The Group has significant investments in overseas operations.
As a result, movements in exchange rates can significantly affect the Groups balance sheet.
Where practicable, borrowings are denominated in the currencies of the Companys net foreign investments with a view to maintaining a low cost of borrowings while hedging against currency depreciation.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge currency flows within its operating units.
The Group seeks to comply with the requirements of hedge accounting where considered appropriate.
The revaluation gains and losses arising from such hedges are recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity to the extent that they are effective.
The ineffective portion of any hedge is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
d Credit risk The credit status of dealing counterparties and institutions where cash is held is kept under review with credit limits being set and monitored accordingly.
e Liquidity management Together with the management of interest rate and balance sheet translation risks, the Groups objective is to achieve a balance between continuity and flexibility of funding by maintaining a range of maturities on its borrowings and deposits.
Net fair values of derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting: Assets Liabilities m m At 31 December 2005: Forward foreign currency contracts cash flow hedges 0.3 2.9 Less: Non-current portion 0.2 Current portion 0.3 2.7 Charter plc Annual Report 2005 67 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21 Financial instruments and risk management continued The net fair value losses at 31 December 2005 on the above open forward foreign exchange contracts are expected to be transferred to the income statement as follows: 2005 2004 m m Losses already recognised in the year 0.7 Losses gains expected to be recognised in the next year 1.8 1.0 Losses expected to be recognised in subsequent years 0.1 2.6 1.0 In accordance with the UK GAAP accounting policy for hedging instruments adopted in 2004, gains and losses were not recognised until the exposure that was being hedged was itself recognised.
The net unrecognised gain on instruments used for hedging at 31 December 2004 was 1.0 million, all of which was expected to be recognised during 2005.
There were no derivatives outstanding at the balance sheet date that were designated as fair value hedges 2004: nil.
Net fair values of derivatives financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting: Assets Liabilities m m At 31 December 2005: Embedded derivatives within contracts 0.3 Forward foreign currency contracts relating to the hedging or management of foreign currency cash or debt positions 1.8 1.8 0.3 Less: Non-current portion Current portion 1.8 0.3 Interest rate swaps There were no outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2005.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations No foreign currency denominated borrowings were designated as hedges of the net investment in foreign operations at 31 December 2005.
At 31 December 2004 the Group had euro borrowings of 28.3 million designated as a hedge of its net investment in foreign operations.
Fair values of financial liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of all the Groups financial liabilities at the year end: Book value Fair value 2005 2004 2005 2004 m m m m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term borrowings 10.4 46.0 10.4 46.2 Long-term borrowings 71.8 65.4 75.7 71.3 The fair values of foreign exchange contracts have been calculated by reference to the prices available from the market on which the instruments are traded.
All other fair values shown above have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair value of short-term deposits and borrowings approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Market price risk The Group monitors the interest rate risks to which it is exposed primarily through a process of sensitivity analysis.
This involves estimating the effect on profit before tax of a range of possible changes in interest rates.
On the basis of the Groups analysis, it is estimated that a rise of one percentage point in the principal interest rates to which the Group is exposed would reduce profit before tax by approximately 0.1 million 2004: 0.4 million.

Charter contests the existence of any such liability.
The issue went to trial in three cases involving the Companys principal subsidiary, Charter Consolidated P. L. C. and other wholly-owned subsidiaries, between 1985 and 1987.
In the first of these cases, tried in Pennsylvania, after an adverse lower court decision the appeal court gave judgement in the Charter defendants favour.
In the second case, in New Jersey, judgement was also given for the Charter defendants.
The third case, in South Carolina, was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, without a decision having been rendered on the issue.
During recent years, Charter and or certain of its subsidiaries have been served in a number of cases in Mississippi, Illinois and a few other states.
Currently the cases against Charter are confined to Mississippi.
Charter is seeking dismissals in these pending cases.
Upon advice of counsel, Charter has settled some of the cases brought in Mississippi and will continue to pursue dismissals in the remainder.
The Directors have received legal advice that Charter and its wholly-owned subsidiaries should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions brought against them, but that uncertainty must exist as to the eventual outcome of the trial of any particular action.
It is not practicable to estimate in any particular case the amount of damages which might ensue if liability were imposed on Charter or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
In 2005, 0.1 million was charged against Charters operating profits in respect of defence costs and other expenses.
The litigation is reviewed each year and, based on that review and legal advice, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any such liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charters financial position.
In these circumstances, the Directors have concluded that it is not appropriate to make any provision in respect of such actions.
ii Air and gas handling Howden Buffalo Inc. an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos-related actions in the United States.
On the advice of counsel, Howden Buffalo is vigorously defending all the cases that have been filed against it.
Over the past few years, Howden Buffalo has sought and received dismissals in 5,295 cases and has, on the advice of counsel, settled 158 cases.
These cases were all settled for nuisance value amounts, much less than the cost of defending the cases at trial.
Howden Buffalo has received legal advice indicating that it should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions that are brought.
At this time, it is not practical to estimate the amount of any potential damages or to provide details of the current stage of proceedings in particular cases, as the majority of cases do not specify the amount of damages sought and the cases are at varying stages in the litigation process.
However, legal fees associated with the defence of these claims have been covered by applicable insurance.
The situation is reviewed regularly and based on the most recent review and legal advice obtained by Howden Buffalo, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any potential liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charters financial position.
In November 2003, Howden Buffalo filed a lawsuit in the US District Court in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, against three insurance companies that provided general liability coverage to a predecessor of Howden Buffalo known as Buffalo Forge Company Buffalo Forge.
The lawsuit sought a declaratory judgement that Howden Buffalo was entitled to coverage under the Buffalo Forge policies for legal defence costs, liabilities and expenses incurred by Howden Buffalo in underlying lawsuits alleging that Howden Buffalo was liable as a successor to Buffalo Forge for asbestos-related injuries allegedly sustained by the claimants as a result of exposure to asbestos in products manufactured by Buffalo Forge.
Howden Buffalo later amended its complaint to seek similar relief against two other insurers that provided coverage to Buffalo Forge and one insurer providing coverage directly to Howden Buffalo.
After extensive negotiations, Howden Buffalo and the insurers executed a coverage-in-place settlement agreement in 2005 that will ensure that most of Howden Buffalos legal defence costs and indemnity obligations are funded by its insurance policies for the foreseeable future.
In certain years, the policies subject to the funding agreement have self-insurance features that may require Howden Buffalo or one of its subsidiaries to contribute a share of the defence and indemnity costs.
However, the Directors believe, based on legal advice, that the majority of asbestos-related lawsuits against Howden Buffalo resulting from the historical operations of Buffalo Forge will be covered, in substantial part, by the insurers participating in the funding agreement under the policies issued to Buffalo Forge and Howden Buffalo.
Charter plc Annual Report 2005 71 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 26 Contingent liabilities continued iii Welding The ESAB Group Inc, EGI, an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits in state and federal courts in the United States alleging personal injuries from exposure to manganese in the fumes of welding consumables.
Other current and former manufacturers of welding consumables have also been named as defendants as well as various trade associations, including the American Welding Society, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, the Ferroalloys Association, and others.
The claimants seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages for unspecified amounts.
A multi-district litigation proceeding has been established to consolidate and co-ordinate pre-trial proceedings in the federal court cases.
Last year, a trial in federal court involving EGI and another welding defendant settled shortly before trial.
The settlement amount is confidential, but is not material to EGIs financial condition.
Trials in federal court were scheduled for February, May and August of 2006.
However, plaintiffs moved to dismiss the February and May cases.
A substitute case has been selected for May.
EGI is a defendant in the federal court cases scheduled for trial.
The state court cases are at varying stages in the litigation process.
One trial in Texas last year not involving EGI resulted in a defence verdict.
However, the court granted a new trial.
Another case in Madison County, Illinois involving EGI also resulted in a defence verdict.
There are over 25 state court trials scheduled for 2006, but it is not anticipated that they will all begin as scheduled.
Whilst litigation is notoriously uncertain and the risk of an adverse jury verdict in any trial exists, having considered the advice of EGIs counsel in the United States, the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims, most of which should be covered in whole or in part by insurance, and EGI, in conjunction with other current and former US manufacturers of welding consumables, is defending these claims vigorously.
In 2005 US$6 million was charged against EGIs operating profits in respect of defence costs net of insurance recoveries.
The estimated defence costs, net of insurance recoveries for 2006 are estimated to be of the order of US$7million, which is reflected in EGIs balance sheet at 31 December 2005.
It is not possible to reliably estimate the total defence costs, which will be involved beyond 2006.
In view of the foregoing and, in particular, the legal advice received in the United States, the Directors do not consider that such claims will have a material adverse effect on Charters financial position.
EGI has also been named as a defendant in a small number of lawsuits in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Maryland, in which claimants allege asbestos-induced personal injuries.
Several cases are listed for trial this year: however, EGI has been dismissed prior to trial in the previous cases in which it was named as a defendant.
Upon the advice of counsel, the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims and EGI intends vigorously to defend these lawsuits.
In addition, the majority of defence costs are being borne by EGIs insurers.

Part of the purchase consideration was satisfied on 13 September 2005 by the issue of 6,424,914 new ordinary shares in the Company, being 3.9 per cent of the enlarged share capital with a fair value of 21.2 million based on the share price.
This acquisition was classified as a related party transaction by the UK Listing Authority.
Costs of 0.9 million were directly attributable to the acquisition.
In January 2006 the vendors received 4.4 million in cash in lieu of dividends that they will not now be paid in respect of the period from 1 January 2004 to 13 September 2005.
Under the terms of the acquisition, the Company has acquired certain holding companies, through which the vendors held their 49 per cent interest in the South American welding and cutting businesses.
In the year ended 31 December 2004, the businesses generated profit before taxation of 8.9 million on sales of 72.1 million including intra-group sales of 2.3 million.
As at 31 December 2004, the businesses had shareholders funds of 22.4 million, gross assets of 34.6 million and net cash of 2.0 million.
All acquisitions have been accounted for using acquisition accounting principles and there were no fair value adjustments.

The additional FRS 17, Retirement benefits, disclosures showed the pension fund surpluses and deficits and the other post-employment benefit liabilities based on the valuation methodologies required by that standard.
IAS 19 has a similar although not identical valuation approach to FRS 17, and in accordance with the transitional exemptions in IFRS 1, all cumulative surpluses and deficits have been recognised in the balance sheet as at 1 January 2004.
On transition to IAS 19 an additional liability of 89.2 million was recognised.
This amount included an allowance of 18.0 million for the future administration costs of the pension scheme that will ultimately be borne by Charter to the extent that those administration costs relate to past service.
FRS 17 would recognise further changes to the surpluses and deficits immediately in subsequent balance sheets whereas IAS 19 permits a smoothing approach to be adopted in which some of the movement in the surpluses and deficits is deferred and recognised over time according to a mechanism referred to as the corridor approach.
Under this approach actuarial gains and losses within a corridor, calculated by reference to the greater of 10 per cent of the gross assets or liabilities of the scheme, can remain unrecognised.
This means that only actuarial movements outside this corridor are required to be recognised, and even then they are recognised in the income statement over the estimated remaining service lives of the relevant employees.
This means that under IAS 19 only the balance sheet at the date of transition will show the full surplus or deficit positions of all of the Groups employee benefit arrangements.
ii Property revaluations IAS 16 Property plant and equipment IAS 16 allows property, plant and equipment to be carried in the balance sheet based on either valuation or cost less depreciation.
Charter has adopted a policy of cost less depreciation.
The transitional rules of IFRS 1 allow companies to revalue certain items of property, plant and equipment at fair value on a selective basis as at the date of transition.
This fair value is treated as the deemed cost for those assets under IFRS.
Charter has revalued certain freehold properties both land and buildings, which has the impact of increasing the carrying value of property, plant and equipment by 16.0 million at the date of transition.
There is an increase in deferred taxation liabilities of 4.5 million, partly offset by the recognition of deferred tax assets of 1.5 million, on transition as a consequence of these revaluations.
The operating profit impact of this is to increase the depreciation cost.
iii Capitalised development costs IAS 38 Intangible assets Under UK GAAP, Charter wrote off all research and development costs as incurred.
IAS 38 requires development costs meeting the criteria specified in the standard to be capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Typically these lives are in the range 3 to 10 years.
iv Goodwill IFRS 3 Business combinations and goodwill Under UK GAAP, Charter capitalised goodwill arising since 1 January 1998 as an intangible fixed asset and it was amortised over its estimated useful life, a period not exceeding 20 years.
Goodwill arising prior to this date was written off against reserves.
Under IFRS, goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life and so is not amortised, but is subject to annual impairment testing.
IFRS 1 allows the goodwill at the date of transition under UK GAAP to be used for the purposes of IFRS at that date, except that negative goodwill at 1 January 2004 has been credited directly to reserves, increasing the carrying value of goodwill and net assets at that date by 0.6 million.
Under the business combinations exemption in IFRS 1, no adjustments have been made for previous business combinations.
In addition goodwill previously written off directly to reserves under UK GAAP will not be recycled to the income statement on the disposal or part-disposal of a subsidiary or associate as it would have been under UK GAAP.
The impact of this is that the goodwill of 6.0 million previously written off to reserves in relation to the disposal of GCE Gas Control Equipment AB that was charged to the 2004 profit and loss account under UK GAAP is not charged to the 2004 income statement under IFRS.
v Share-based payments IFRS 2 Share-based payments Under UK GAAP, Charter spread the full cost of options and shares over the vesting period where it was probable that a liability would arise.
The cost was calculated by reference to the difference between the market price of the shares at the balance sheet date, or at the date of vesting if earlier, and any proceeds receivable.
The corresponding entry was shown as a liability.
Under IFRS 2 the fair value of the equity instrument is calculated at the date of grant and is spread over the vesting period for equity settled arrangements with the corresponding entry credited to equity.
As there were no relevant outstanding arrangements at the date of transition to IFRS there is no difference at this date.
The charge in 2004 is similar under UK GAAP and IFRS but there is a reduction in liabilities of 0.4 million at 31 December 2004 because the credit entry is taken to equity under IFRS rather than being treated as a liability.
74 Charter plc Annual Report 2005 30 IFRS transition reconciliations continued vi Reclassification of associates tax IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Under UK GAAP, the share of the operating profit, interest and taxation of associated undertakings were disclosed separately in the income statement.
IAS 1 requires the result of associated undertakings to be presented net of interest and taxation as a single line item.
vii Deferred taxation IAS 12 Income taxes Under UK GAAP deferred taxation was provided on the basis of timing differences between the accounting and taxable profits.
IFRS has a different approach and is based on the balance sheet with deferred taxation provided on all temporary differences between the book carrying values and the tax base of assets and liabilities.
The impact of this is an additional deferred taxation liability of 3.0 million in relation to the revaluation of land and buildings under IFRS 1 and an additional deferred taxation asset of 0.9 million in relation to the increase in liabilities for post retirement benefits under IAS 19. viii Unauthorised payments arising in prior years IAS 8 Accounting policies, accounting estimates and errors Under UK GAAP, errors identified in an accounting period relating to earlier periods were generally accounted for in the period in which the error was identified unless they were considered fundamental.
However IAS 8 requires that material prior period errors should be accounted for by adjusting the comparative information for the periods affected.
Consequently 5.0 million, relating to the unauthorised payments announced on 20 August 2004 which arose prior to 1 January 2004, is not charged to income in 2004 under IFRS.
This adjustment has no impact on net assets.
ix Foreign currency losses on inter-company loan element of net investments IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates Exchange gains and losses arising from the retranslation of certain intra-group loans were taken directly to reserves under UK GAAP where the loan was considered long-term in nature and was considered part of the net investment in a subsidiary.
IAS 21 is more restrictive in terms of which loans can be treated in this way and as a consequence certain amounts taken directly to reserves under UK GAAP have been included in the income statement under IFRS.
As these amounts are determined by reference to movements in exchange rates, this is likely to give rise to greater income statement volatility in the future.
However this different treatment has no impact on net assets as an equal and opposite amount has been taken directly to reserves on consolidation.
Since the publication of the press release Charter plc Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards on 17 June 2005 the functional currency of two non-trading subsidiaries has been changed.
The only impact of this change is to reduce the amount of the exchange loss required to be reclassified from reserves to the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004 to 3.0 million.
There is no impact on net assets.
x Balance sheet reclassifications In addition to the above items a number of items have been reclassified in the balance sheet under IFRS.
The principal items are: Capitalised software previously included within tangible fixed assets under UK GAAP has been transferred to intangible assets under IFRS: Leases that include a land element which were accounted for as finance leases under UK GAAP have been split so that the land element is treated as an operating lease under IFRS: Amounts recoverable under contracts that were included within stock and work in progress under UK GAAP are included within trade and other receivables under the IFRS balance sheet format: Deferred taxation assets and liabilities were shown net under UK GAAP but are included separately as assets and liabilities under IFRS.
xi Cash flow statement Cash flows reported under IFRS and UK GAAP are defined differently under IFRS, cash flows, referred to as cash and cash equivalents, include bank deposits repayable within 3 months.
Under UK GAAP, these were treated as short-term deposits: IFRS requires cash flows to be reported under the three headings of operating, investing and financing activities whereas UK GAAP requires cash flows to be reported in greater detail under 9 standard headings, such as taxation and interest: IFRS requires foreign currency translation differences to be included on the face of the cash flow statement in order that opening and closing cash and cash equivalents balances may be reconciled.
This is not a requirement under UK GAAP.
Charter plc Annual Report 2005 75 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 IFRS transition reconciliations financial instruments first time adoption IAS 32 and IAS39 The adoption of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement with effect from 1 January 2005 results in a change in the Groups accounting policy for financial instruments.
The impact of these standards on the Groups opening balance sheet is shown below.
The principal impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on the Groups financial statements relates to the recognition of derivative financial instruments at fair value.
Financial assets and financial liabilities that arise on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are held on the balance sheet at fair value with the changes in value reflected through the income statement.
The accounting treatment of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting depends on how they are designated.
The varying accounting treatments are explained below.
Cash flow hedges The Group hedges the foreign currency exposure on certain revenue and purchase contracts.
Under UK GAAP, foreign currency derivatives were held off balance sheet.
Under IAS 39, derivative financial instruments that qualify for cash flow hedging are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value with corresponding fair value changes deferred in equity in a separate hedging reserve.
Net investment hedges The gains or losses on the translation of currency borrowings used to hedge the Groups net investments in foreign entities are recognised in equity.
Provided the hedging requirements of IAS 39 are met and the hedging relationship is fully effective, this treatment does not differ from UK GAAP.
The adjustments to the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2005 are as follows: m Derivative financial instruments Current assets 1.5 Derivative financial instruments Current liabilities 0.7 Deferred income tax liabilities 0.2 Increase in net assets 0.6 Hedging reserve 0.6 In addition as at 1 January 2005 the following balance sheet reclassifications are required on the adoption of IAS 39: Borrowings and cash are required to be grossed up for 24.7 million of cash held in cash pools: and The interest payable accrual of 1.6 million is reclassified from trade and other payables to borrowings.
