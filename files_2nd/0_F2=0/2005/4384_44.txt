Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 30.
Contingent Liabilities Banff Contingent Payment The Exchange Agreement which the Group completed with ENI-Agip on 20 March 2002, states that the Group will make a payment to ENI-Agip of 3,000,000 upon production and sale of an aggregate total of 30,000,000 barrels of crude oil from the Banff field, post the effective date of the acquisition of 1 July 2001.
On current projections the payment would be due sufficiently far into the future, as to raise doubt over its likelihood.
The Group will, however, continue to monitor the field and will provide for the payment if it becomes probable that the production target will be reached.
Other Related Party Transactions Sales of US$15,255,000 2004: US$13,666,000 were made by the Group through Lukoil, the other significant shareholder in Yoganoil.
All sales were on an arms-length basis at prevailing domestic market prices.
At 31 December 2005 US$1,419,000 was owed by Lukoil to Yoganoil 2004: US$784,000 in respect of such sales.
Pensions The Group contributes to the personal pension arrangements of Executive Directors and employees up to a specified percentage of salary in lieu of a formal corporate scheme.
Total pension contributions in lieu amounted to 255,000 2004: 237,000 for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Transition to IFRS For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2004, the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
These financial statements, for the year ended 31 December 2005, are the first the Group is required to prepare in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Accordingly, the Group has prepared financial statements which comply with IFRS applicable for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and the significant accounting policies meeting those requirements are described in Note 2.
In preparing these financial statements, the Group has started from an opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2004, the Groups date of transition to IFRS, and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements required by IFRS 1 for the first time adoption of IFRS.
This note explains the principal adjustments made by the Group in restating its UK GAAP balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Where the Groups UK GAAP financial information was based on estimates, the same estimates have been applied in preparing the IFRS financial information.
Where IFRS requires estimates that were not previously required under UK GAAP, they have been based only on those factors existing on the relevant balance sheet date.
This is consistent with treating information received after the balance sheet date as non-adjusting events under IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date.
Estimates not previously required under UK GAAP primarily relate to financial instruments, embedded derivatives and share based payments.
