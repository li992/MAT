Notes on financial statements continued 35 Derivative financial instruments An outline of the groups financial risks and the policies and objectives pursued in relation to those risks is set out in the financial risk management section on pages 24-26.
This note contains the disclosures required by IAS 32 for derivative financial instruments.
IAS 39 prescribes strict criteria for hedge accounting, whether as a cash flow or fair value hedge, and requires that any derivative that does not meet these criteria should be classified as trading and marked-to-market.
BP adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 with effect from 1 January 2005 without restating prior periods.
Consequently, the groups accounting policy under UK GAAP has been used for 2004 and 2003.
The policy under UK GAAP and the disclosures required by UK GAAP for derivative financial instruments are shown in Note 37.
In the normal course of business the group is a party to derivative financial instruments derivatives with off-balance sheet risk, primarily to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt.
The group also manages certain of its exposures to movements in oil, natural gas and power prices.
In addition, the group trades derivatives in conjunction with these risk management activities.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2005 are set out below.

Changes in the fair value of instruments used as hedges are not recognized in the accounts until the position matures.
The hedges were assessed to be highly effective.
An analysis of these changes in fair value is as follows: $ million Net fair value Fair value of cash flow hedges at 1 January 2005 198 Change in fair value during the year 191 Fair value recognized in income statement during the year 8 Fair value on capital expenditure hedging recycled into carrying value of assets during the year 37 Fair value of cash flow hedges at 31 December 2005 38 Cash flow hedges have the following maturities: $ million 2005 Fair value Fair value asset liability Within one year 54 108 1 to 2 years 19 17 2 to 3 years 3 3 3 to 4 years 6 1 4 to 5 years 2 Over 5 years 7 91 129 72 Making energy more 35 Derivative financial instruments continued Derivative assets related to foreign exchange risks of cash flow hedges are denominated in the following currencies: $ million 2005 Currencies purchased forward Other US dollar Sterling Euro currencies Total Currencies sold forward US dollar 57 15 15 1 88 Sterling 3 3 57 15 18 1 91 Derivative liabilities related to foreign exchange risks of cash flow hedges are denominated in the following currencies: $ million 2005 Currencies purchased forward Other US dollar Sterling Euro currencies Total Currencies sold forward US dollar 70 40 19 129 FAIR VALUE HEDGES At 31 December 2005, the group held interest rate and currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk on fixed rate debt issued by the group.
These hedges were assessed to be highly effective.
At 31 December 2005, the loss on fair value hedges included in the carrying value of fixed rate debt was $100 million.

This is where, at contract inception, derivatives are required to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value, but any gain or loss is not recognized immediately but deferred on the balance sheet.
The gain or loss is recognized in the income statement only when the full remaining term of the derivative can be valued against market inputs.

The hedge was assessed to be highly effective.
At 31 December 2005, the hedge had a fair value of $63 million and the gain on the hedge recognized in equity was $58 million.
US dollars have been sold forward for sterling purchased, with a maturity of 3 to 4 years.
DERIVATIVES HELD FOR TRADING The group maintains active trading positions in a variety of derivatives.
This activity is undertaken in conjunction with risk management activities.
Derivatives held for trading purposes are marked-to-market and any gain or loss recognized in the income statement.
For traded derivatives, many positions have been neutralized, with trading initiatives being concluded by taking opposite positions to fix a gain or loss, thereby achieving a zero net market risk.
The following table shows the fair value at 31 December of derivatives and other financial instruments held for trading purposes.
The fair values at the year end are not materially unrepresentative of the position throughout the year.

Prices provided by other external sources refers to the fair value of contracts valued in part using active quotes and in part using observable, market-corroborated data or internal inputs, for example, swaps and physical forward contracts.
Prices based on models and other valuation methods refers to the fair value of a contract valued in part using internal models due to the absence of quoted prices, including over-the-counter options.
The net change in fair value of contracts based on models and other valuation methods during the year is a gain of $130 million.
BP Annual Report and Accounts 2005 75 Notes on financial statements continued 35 Derivative financial instruments continued Market risk exposure The group measures its market risk exposure, i. e. potential gain or loss in fair values, on its held-for-trading activity using value-at-risk techniques.
These techniques are based on a variance covariance model or a Monte Carlo simulation and make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market values over a 24-hour period.
The calculation of the range of potential changes in fair value takes into account a snapshot of the end-of-day exposures and the history of one-day price movements, together with the correlation of these price movements.
The group calculates value-at-risk for the bulk of instruments and exposures in the held-for-trading category, other than the UK North Sea natural gas embedded derivatives, for which a sensitivity analysis is calculated.
The group has previously calculated and published value-at-risk expressed to three standard deviations for the internal delegation of market risk limits and control purposes.
This is equivalent to a 99.7% confidence interval or a probability of one day per year where the daily gain or loss will exceed the calculated value at risk if the portfolio was left unchanged.
In order to improve the practical application of this tool, the group has adopted a 95% confidence level, or calculation to 1.65 standard deviations.
This has the effect of increasing the expected frequency of occasions when the daily gain or loss may exceed the calculated value-at-risk to one per month if the portfolio is left unchanged.
This provides a better opportunity for verifying models and assumptions and improving accuracy of the value-at-risk calculation.
For completeness, 2005 value-at-risk data has been disclosed using both the 95% and 99.7% confidence levels.
The value-at-risk model takes account of derivative financial instruments types such as interest rate forward and futures contracts, swap agreements, options and swaptions: foreign exchange forward and futures contracts, swap agreements and options, and oil, natural gas and power price futures, swap agreements and options.
Financial assets and liabilities and physical crude oil and refined products that are treated as held for trading positions are also included in these calculations.
The value-at-risk calculation for oil, natural gas and power price exposure also includes cash-settled commodity contracts such as forward contracts.
For options, a linear approximation is included in the value-at-risk models.
The following table shows values at risk for held for trading activities described above.

It is considered that a more comprehensive representation of the groups oil, natural gas and power price trading activities is given by aggregating the gain or loss on such derivatives, together with the gain or loss arising from the physical and paper trades to which they relate, representing the net result of the trading portfolio.
Also included in the net result of the held-for-trading portfolio are broker fees, transportation costs and trader bonuses.
Held-for-trading results include the results of risk management activity in respect of the groups supply and marketing activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

These contract types include futures, options, swaps and certain forward sales and purchase contracts where delivery is routinely obviated by the sale or purchase of offsetting contracts.
Also included are the gains and losses relating to the change in the fair value of all derivative contracts held at the balance sheet dates, including derivative contracts presented gross when settled.
The gain for the year presented net in the income statement was $838 million 2004 $1,216 million and 2003 $1,081 million.
76 Making energy more 35 Derivative financial instruments continued EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES HELD FOR TRADING Prior to the development of an active gas trading market, UK gas contracts were priced using a basket of available price indices, primarily relating to oil products.
Post the development of an active UK gas market, certain contracts were entered into or renegotiated using pricing formulae not directly related to gas prices, for example, oil product and power prices.
In these circumstances, pricing formulae have been determined to be derivatives, embedded within the overall contractual arrangements that are not clearly and closely related to the underlying commodity.
The resulting fair value relating to these contracts is recognized on the balance sheet with gains or losses recognized in the income statement.
These contracts are valued using price curves for each of the different products that are built up from active market pricing data and extrapolated to 2018 using the maximum available external pricing information.
Additionally, where limited data exists for certain products, prices are interpolated using historic and long-term pricing relationships.
The fair values of embedded derivatives are included on the balance sheet within the following headings.
