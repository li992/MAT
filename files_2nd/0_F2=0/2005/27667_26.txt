3 SEGMENT INFORMATION i Basis of segmentation Geographical segments For management purposes the Group is organised on a geographical basis into the following segments: Africa, North America and United Kingdom & Rest of the World.
This is the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Business segments Although the Group is managed primarily on a geographical basis, it operates in four principle areas of business: long-term business, general insurance, banking and asset management.
These businesses operate independently within each geographical sector.
Financial information about the Groups geographic and business segments is presented in note 3 ii below.
Where financial information is required for both primary and secondary segments, this information is shown in the format of a matrix.
Notes 3 iii to 3 ix provide additional supplemental information for each business segment and have been presented in accordance with the adjusted operating profit format used in preparation of the summary consolidated income statement, including a reconciliation to the consolidated income statement format.
Inter-segment revenue and expenses are included in the presentation of the additional supplemental information which are eliminated within the consolidated income statement.
In presenting information on the basis of geographical segments, segment revenue is based on the geographical location of customers.
There are no significant differences between the geographical location of assets and operations and the associated external revenues.
Business transacted with South African residents in terms of their personal offshore allowances is conducted by the Groups offshore companies and is therefore disclosed under the Rest of World segment.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

additional 3 million from Old Mutual South African Unclaimed Shares Trusts.
This amount represents final settlement of accumulated dividends and interest accrued in respect of shares of the Company unclaimed at 12 July 2004, being five years after the demutualisation of the South Africa Mutual Life Assurance Society.
It is the firm intention of the Board that all of this money will eventually be distributed to public benefit and charitable organisations and, therefore, full provision has been made for the cost of making such distributions.
Net other income expenses includes recognition of movements for certain pension deficits in defined benefit schemes.
