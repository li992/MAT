Financial Instruments The Group holds or issues financial instruments for two main purposes: To finance the development and subsequent long term retention of investment properties: To manage the interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments such as trade debtors, trade creditors, accruals and prepayments arise directly from the Groups operations.
The majority of financial instruments are of sterling denominations.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments or derivatives.
The Group finances its development and investment activities through a mixture of retained earnings, borrowings and fresh issues of equity.
The Group borrows from bank holders and major banking institutions at both fixed and floating rates of interest, using derivatives where appropriate to generate the desired effective interest rate basis.
The derivatives used for this purpose are interest rate swaps.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and market price risk, and to a lesser extent, currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits is managed by using interest rate swaps and in some cases, simple fixed rate borrowing.
The Groups policy is separated into three areas: i Development finance The majority of the Groups development borrowing at 31 December 2005 is held at floating rate reflecting the Groups view of the stability of the current interest rate environment and the relatively low cost of adverse interest rate fluctuations in the context of the total development cost.
The Group continues to review the appropriateness of this policy on a regular basis.
ii Refinancing risk The Groups principal exposure to interest rate fluctuations during development relates to movements in longer term interest rates, which affect the quantum of debt the property income is capable of servicing at completion.
Significant adverse movements undermine the Groups capital recycling strategy.
The Group manages this risk via a programme of pre-hedging, through the use of forward starting interest rate swaps.
At 31 December 2005 approximately 13.9m 2004: 17.2m of the Groups anticipated refinancing was hedged for an average term of 4 years 2004: 20 years.
iii Medium and long term finance The Group holds its medium and long term bank finance under floating rate arrangements.
The majority of this debt is hedged through the use of interest rate swap agreements, although not all these agreements qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
During 2005, the Groups policy has been to hedge in excess of 80% of the Groups exposure for terms of approximately 4-20 years.
The Groups bond issuance attracts a fixed rate of interest over an average life of 16.1 years.
At 31 December 2005, after taking account of interest rate swaps, 98% 2004: 89% of the Groups medium and long term investment borrowing was held at fixed rates.
This is fixed at an average rate of 6.62% 2004: 6.65% over an average unexpired term of 11 years 2004: 13 years.
60 8717 Unite Annual Report 29 3 06 9:35 am Page 61 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 22.
Financial Instruments continued Liquidity risk With respect to its development activities, the directors have adopted a policy whereby the Group injects the full amount of equity required for each development before drawing debt under associated facilities.
In this way, the funding requirements of each scheme are substantially ring fenced and secured at the outset of works.
The Groups medium term banking facilities are fully revolving, allowing the Group to apply its cash surpluses in the temporary reduction of its debt obligations.
Market price risk The Groups primary market price risk is interest rate exposure.
It monitors this exposure through a process of sensitivity analysis, estimating the effect on operating cash flow over various periods of a range of possible changes in interest rates.
At 31 December 2005, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Groups profit before tax by approximately 0.1m.
Effective and ineffective interest rate swaps have been included in this calculation.
The Groups policy is to accept a degree of interest rate risk, provided the effects of the various potential changes in rates remain within certain prescribed parameters.
Currency risk The Group carries on a small amount of trade in Euros.
The directors do not consider the volumes of this trade significant enough to warrant a formal foreign exchange policy.
To the extent that this trade increases in the future, the directors will implement an appropriate policy.
Credit risk Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.

Explanation of transition to IFRS The accounting policies set out in note 1 have been applied in preparing these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 and in the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 the Groups transition date.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the Group and the Company have adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared under UK GAAP.
An explanation of how transition from previous UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the Groups and the Companys financial position and financial performance is set out in the following tables and notes.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Group Reconciliation of profit Year ended 31 December 2004 Note 2004 Effect of transition to UK GAAP IFRS IFRS 000 000 000 Revenue 74,623 - 74,623 Cost of sales 24,678 - 24,678 Administrative expenses goodwill amortisation impairment d 2,665 150 2,515 other d 14,154 130 14,284 Administrative expenses 16,819 20 16,799 Profit on disposal of investment property 23 - 23 Net valuation gains on investment property b - 20,869 20,869 Net operating profit before net financing costs 33,149 20,889 54,038 Finance income 1,137 - 1,137 Finance costs 38,098 - 38,098 Net financing costs 36,961 - 36,961 Share of joint venture profit a -30 30 Profit before tax 3,812 20,919 17,107 Tax credit a - 233 233 Profit for the year 3,812 21,152 17,340 65 8717 Unite Annual Report 29 3 06 9:35 am Page 66 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 25.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Explanatory Notes a Deferred tax IAS 12 requires full provision of all taxable temporary differences whereas an exemption to provision for potential capital gains tax was available under UK GAAP.
Under IFRS the Group has to recognise the capital gains tax that would be payable if it were to sell its property portfolio at book value.
The resultant deferred tax liabilities have been provided in both restated balance sheets.
This also affects the carrying value of the Groups joint venture at 31 December 2004 which must now make a provision for deferred tax in its balance sheet, reducing the Groups share of its net assets.
The movements in the deferred tax liabilities are recognised directly in equity to the extent that they relate to items recognised directly in equity, otherwise being recognised in the income statement.
Revaluation of investment property under development falls into the former category refer below and therefore the deferred tax movement relating to these revaluations is also recognised directly in equity.
b Investment property and investment property under development Under IFRS, completed investment property accounted for under IAS 40 is held separately from investment property under development accounted for under IAS16.
For ease of comparison, the investment property under UK GAAP in the reconciliation above has been divided into completed and properties under development.
Completed investment property is carried at fair value under IAS 40 which equates to the market value previously applied under UK GAAP.
There is therefore no equity impact arising from the change to IFRS in respect of these properties.
Investment property under development is carried at fair value under IAS 16 which differs slightly from the directors valuations previously applied under UK GAAP.
This has resulted in additional value being recognised in both the opening and closing balance sheets.
IFRS fair values for both the above classes of property have been calculated by the Groups external valuers.
Under UK GAAP, all revaluations of property were made directly in equity unless values fell below cost.
Under IFRS, investment properties under development continue to be accounted for in this way but completed property valuation movements are recognised in the income statement.
In addition, when a property under development is completed and transferred to investment property the difference between its fair value at that date and its previous carrying amount is recognised in the income statement.
This has resulted in an increase in profit for the year of 20.869m under IFRS.
c Interest rate swaps - Group Under UK GAAP and IFRS, interest rate swaps have been carried at cost up until 31 December 2004.
With effect from 1 January 2005, the date of transition for the purposes of IAS 39, interest rate swaps have been carried at fair value.
The adjustments for IFRS in this note do not reflect the effects of IAS 39 as they show the impact on the 2003 and 2004 balance sheets but these are summarised in note 1.
At 1 January 2005 the Group was required to recognise liabilities totalling 9.347m and a related deferred tax asset of 2.804m in relation to its interest rate swaps.
The resulting movement in net assets of 6.543m is split between swaps which do not qualify as hedges which must be debited to retained earnings and those which do qualify, which must be debited to the hedging reserve refer accounting policies note 1 c. Under the transitional provisions of IAS 39 this takes effect as an adjustment to the opening reserves for 2005.

Explanation of transition to IFRS continued d Other changes Under the transitional rules goodwill has been recognised at deemed cost equivalent to its carrying value.
Unlike UK GAAP, goodwill is not amortised under IFRS but is subject to impairment testing.
The impact is that 2.665m of UK GAAP amortisation is replaced by 2.515m of impairment charged against the profit for the year.
Dividends are not recognised until declared under IFRS.
The 2003 and 2004 final proposed dividends are therefore added back to net assets at the relevant balance sheet dates 1.807m and 1.859m for 2003 and 2004 respectively.
For the Company this also defers recognition of dividends receivable from subsidiaries 3.700m and 5.000m for 2003 and 2004 respectively.
The Groups share based incentives for employees are recognised through the income statement at fair value over the vesting period small adjustments to both income statement and balance sheets.
Computer software is held as an intangible asset under IFRS resulting in a transfer between asset categories no profit impact.
Receivables due after more than one year are shown separately as non-current under IFRS previously included in current assets but disclosed as recoverable in more than one year.
Under IFRS, the revaluation reserve at 31 December 2004 represents cumulative valuation gains and losses less related deferred tax liabilities on properties classified as investment properties under development at the balance sheet date.
e Parent company Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are now carried at fair value previously net asset value under UK GAAP with movements in valuation being recognised through the income statement.
Dividends and receivables due after more than one year have been adjusted as explained above.
f Cash flow statement Changes to the Group profit for the year manifest themselves in the cash flow statement as changes to the items which reconcile profit to cash flows from operating activities.
This reconciliation is shown on the cash flow statement itself.
Other than formatting, there have been no other significant changes to the cash flow statement.
