com Advisors details and investor information Capital gains tax base cost of Filtrona shares Following the demerger of Filtrona from Bunzl plc, the base cost of any UK shareholders holding in Bunzl plc at 6 June 2005 must be split between their new holding in Bunzl plc and their new holding in Filtrona plc as follows: Filtrona plc shares 21.86% of the aggregate base cost Bunzl plc shares 78.14% of the aggregate base cost If, for example, on 3 June 2005 a shareholder held 180 Bunzl shares with an aggregate base cost of 600, then immediately after the demerger and the share consolidations they would have owned 140 Bunzl shares and 90 Filtrona shares.
The 600 base cost should be allocated as follows: The base cost of the 90 consolidated Filtrona shares would be 21.86% of the aggregate base cost of 600 i. e. 600.00 x 21.86% 131.16.
Each new consolidated Filtrona share would have a base cost of 131.16 90 145.7p.
The base cost of the 140 consolidated Bunzl shares would be 78.14% of the aggregate base cost of 600 i. e. 600.00 x 78.14% 468.84.
Each new consolidated Bunzl share would have a base cost of 468.84 140 334.9p.
If you are in any doubt about the allocation of the base cost between the shares of the two companies you should consult your tax advisor.
