Notes to the financial statements Accounting policies The Group financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards.
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is given below.
Accounting policies have been applied consistently with previous years.
The Directors have reviewed the appropriateness of the Groups accounting policies in accordance with FRS 18, Accounting policies, and believe that they continue to be appropriate.
Under the transitional rules of FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, the Group has made certain disclosures in relation to the balance sheet and performance statements which are presented in note 28.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the valuation of current asset investments set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet include the accounts of the Company, all of its subsidiary undertakings and share of Joint Ventures.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are included in the profit and loss account from the date of acquisition and the results of subsidiary undertakings disposed during the year are included in the profit and loss account up to the date of disposal.
The accounts of the Employee Benefit Trusts EBTs are incorporated into the results of the Group as, although they are administered by independent Trustees and their assets are held separately from the Group, in practice the Groups advice on how the assets are used for the benefit of employees is normally accepted.
The Group bears the major risks and rewards of the assets held by the EBTs until the shares vest unconditionally in the employees.
In accordance with UITF 38, Accounting for Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP Trusts, shares in WS Atkins plc held by the EBTs are shown as a reduction in shareholders funds.
Other assets and liabilities held by the EBTs are consolidated with the assets of the Group.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no profit and loss account is presented for the parent company.
Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less a provision for amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost in equal annual instalments over its expected useful life.
The useful life is not normally expected to exceed 20 years and represents the periods over which the Directors estimate that the values of the underlying businesses acquired are expected to exceed the value of the underlying assets.
Provision is made for impairment.
Goodwill which arose prior to 1 April 1997 has been written off to the profit and loss reserve.
Profit or loss on disposal of the underlying business to which it relates includes goodwill that has not previously been charged to the profit and loss account.
Joint Ventures In accordance with FRS 9, Associates and Joint Ventures, the Group accounts for Joint Ventures under the gross equity method of accounting.
The results of holdings in Joint Ventures are included from the date on which the Group acquires joint control.
The Group undertakes PFI PPP activities through its Joint Ventures Special Purpose Companies.
These activities include the construction and operation of infrastructure for the Public Sector PFI PPP concessions.
Where there is sufficient evidence that an event has irrevocably changed the relationship between the Group and the Joint Venture such that the Groups ability to exercise significant influence and joint control is removed, the carrying amount at the date of the event is reported as an investment and no account is taken of subsequent changes in the Joint Ventures assets and liabilities.
The results, assets and liabilities of Joint Ventures are stated in accordance with Group accounting policies.
Where Joint Ventures adopt accounting policies that are different from the Group, their reported results are restated to comply with Group accounting policies.
Where Joint Ventures do not adopt accounting periods that are co-terminous with the Groups results, results and net assets are based upon accounts drawn up to the Groups accounting reference date.
Accounting policies used by Joint Ventures Assets constructed as part of a PFI PPP concession are classified as fixed assets where the Special Purpose Company takes a greater share of the risk associated with the asset than the Public Sector Authority.
The fixed assets are amortised over the lower of their useful lives and the remaining contract period.
Where the Public Sector Authority assumes the greater share of the risk, the asset is classified as a long term receivable.
Payments received from the Public Sector Authority are then apportioned between capital, interest and operating payments.
Interest receivable is recognised on the basis of a specific rate of return on the associated asset.
Revenue is recognised when earned and in accordance with obligations delivered.
Fees paid by a Special Purpose Company SPC to its shareholders subsequent to Financial Close on a PFI PPP concession are capitalised in the balance sheet of the SPC and amortised over the period of the concession, after adjusting for impairment if necessary.
The Group treats the fees received in accordance with UITF 34, Pre-contract costs, as set out in the policy on Pre-contract costs relating to PFI PPP investments which involve SPCs on page 53.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2005 52 Joint Ventures continued Interest that is directly attributable to the financing of tangible fixed assets in the course of construction is capitalised as part of the cost of those assets commencing at the start of construction and ceasing when the asset is complete and ready for use.
Turnover Group turnover from long-term contracts comprises the value of work performed during the year by reference to total sales value and stage of completion of these contracts.
Turnover from other contract activities represents fee income receivable in respect of services provided during the year.
Under certain services contracts, the Group manages customer expenditure and is obliged to purchase goods and services from third party sub-contractors and recharge them on to the customer at cost.
The amounts charged by contractors and recharged to customers are excluded from turnover and cost of sales.
Debtors, creditors and cash relating to these transactions are included in the Group balance sheet.
Contract accounting The value of contract work in progress comprises the costs incurred on contracts plus an appropriate proportion of overheads and attributable profit.
Profit is recognised on a percentage completion basis when the outcome of a contract or project can be reasonably foreseen.
Provision is made in full for estimated losses.
Where the outcome of a contract cannot be reasonably foreseen, profit is taken on completion.
Where a contract spans two accounting periods profit is not generally recognised until the contract is 50% complete.
Fees invoiced on account are deducted from the value of work in progress and the balance is separately disclosed in debtors as amounts recoverable on contracts, unless such fees exceed the value of the work in progress on any contract when the excess is separately disclosed in current liabilities as fees invoiced in advance.
Income recognition on outsourcing contracts is determined based on the proportion of the annual service delivered to date.
Where the costs of obligations in relation to the non-renewal or termination of a contract are higher in the final year of the contract a proportion of revenue is deferred each year to meet these anticipated costs.
Full provision is made for losses on outsourcing contracts if the forecast costs of fulfilling the contract throughout the contract period exceed the forecast income receivable.
In assessing the amount of the loss to provide on an outsourcing contract, account is taken of the Groups share of the forecast results from Joint Ventures which the contract is servicing.
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Pre-contract costs relating to PFI PPP investments which involve Special Purpose Companies The Group accounts for all pre-contract costs in accordance with UITF 34, Pre-contract costs.
Costs incurred before it is virtually certain that a contract will be obtained are charged to expenses.
Directly attributable costs incurred after that point are recognised in the balance sheet and charged to the profit and loss account over the same period as the Groups interest in any SPC charges the equivalent capitalised amounts to the profit and loss account.
Bid recovery fees are deferred and credited to the profit and loss account over the same period as the Groups interest in any SPC charges the equivalent capitalised amounts to the profit and loss account.
Where the Groups interest in an SPC reduces, the deferred bid recovery fees are credited to the profit and loss account in proportion to the reduction in the Groups interest.
Depreciation and amortisation Tangible and intangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight line basis calculated at annual rates to write off each asset over the term of its useful life as follows: Goodwill 10 to 20 years Freehold buildings 10 to 50 years Short leasehold over the life of the lease Plant and machinery 3 to 10 years Special purpose industrial motor vehicles 3 to 12 years Other motor vehicles 3 to 4 years 1 Information Technology 2 2 to 5 years Corporate Information Systems 6 years No depreciation is provided in respect of freehold land.
The Directors annually review the estimated useful lives of the fixed assets.
Costs included in Corporate Information Systems are those directly attributable to design, construction and testing of new systems including major enhancements from the point of inception to the point of satisfactory completion.
Costs include costs of own labour.
Maintenance and minor modifications are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2005 53 Notes to the financial statements continued Accounting policies continued Share Scheme Reserve and cost of options The Share Scheme Reserve represents the investment in own shares which are held by the EBTs primarily to satisfy the Groups liabilities to employees for share options and other long term incentive plans.
In accordance with UITF 17, as amended, Employee share schemes, the difference between the market value of the shares at the date of the award and any consideration paid for the shares is charged to the profit and loss account over the performance period of each scheme.
Any cumulative charge relating to options which have lapsed in the year is reversed in the year of lapse.
The charge is applied to all share option schemes including SAYE schemes.
Current asset investments Current asset investments include UK Government securities, short-term deposits and marketable securities and restricted cash deposits, which are shown at market value.
Restricted cash deposits relate to accounts where withdrawals are restricted under contractual agreements.
These are treated as liquid resources within the cash flow statement.
Leases Assets held under leases that result in Group companies receiving substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases and capitalised as tangible fixed assets at the estimated present value of the underlying lease payments.
The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods to reflect a constant rate of interest on the outstanding obligation.
The corresponding finance lease obligation is included within creditors.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Where the Group acts as a lessor in an arrangement which transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to a third party, that lease is treated as a finance lease.
All other lease arrangements are treated as operating leases.
Debtors under finance leases represent outstanding amounts due under these agreements less finance charges allocated to future periods.
Finance lease interest is recognised over the primary period of the lease so as to produce a constant rate of return on the net cash investment.
Rental income from operating leases is accounted for on a straight line basis over the period of the lease and included in turnover.
Interest Interest is charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the underlying instrument.
Pension schemes Contributions to funded defined benefit pension schemes are calculated as a percentage of the pensionable salaries of employees, agreed on independent actuarial advice.
The cost of providing pensions and any variations from the regular cost, arising from actuarial valuations, is charged or credited to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of the members of each scheme.
The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
The difference between the charge for pensions and the total contributions actually paid is included within provisions for liabilities and charges.
The pension costs relating to the defined contribution schemes represent contributions payable by the Group.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where the transactions or events that give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future have occurred by the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised only when it can be regarded as more likely than not that it will be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis using tax rates that have been enacted by the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the forward contract rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
The results of overseas subsidiaries and Joint Ventures are translated at average rates of exchange for the year and their assets and liabilities are translated at year end rates.
Exchange differences on opening net assets and results for the year less offsetting foreign currency loans and other hedging instruments to the extent that they hedge the Groups investments are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other exchange differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Financial derivatives The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to fluctuations in foreign currencies.
Forward contracts used to hedge foreign currency investments are revalued to year end rates and any exchange differences are taken to reserves.
Gains and losses on financial instruments used to hedge foreign currency transactions are recognised on maturity of the underlying transaction in the profit and loss account or as adjustments to carrying amounts in the balance sheet.
Gains and losses on financial instruments which are terminated because the underlying exposure ceases to exist are taken immediately to the profit and loss account.
The Group does not hold financial assets or liabilities for trading.
Warrants Warrants are held within shareholders funds at the fair value of the consideration received at the date of issue.
The fair value is deemed to be the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the prevailing market value of the shares at the date of issuing the warrants.
Where warrants are issued as consideration for the cost of a debt instrument the fair value of the warrant is charged to the profit and loss account on a weighted average basis over the life of the debt instrument.
Warrants that lapse unexercised are credited back to the profit and loss account reserve.

Capital commitments for Metronet represent long-term contractual commitment under the 30-year Public Private Partnership PPP contract signed 1 with London Underground Limited on 4 April 2003.
The 30-year contract is broken down into four 7 2 year periods.
4. f Metronet Financial Close On 4 April 2003, Financial Close was reached on the 30-year Metronet London Underground PPP in which the Group is a 20% equal partner.
At Financial Close, Atkins received 20.1m in respect of bid cost recoveries and project development fees from Metronet.
In line with the Groups accounting policy in relation to pre-contract costs incurred on PFI PPP investments, this sum was recognised on the balance sheet and will be released to the profit and loss account over 30 years.
Atkins is required to invest 70m in Metronet by way of equity and shareholder subordinated debt over the first six years of the concession.
During the year ended 31 March 2005, the Group invested 11.1m 2004: 10.4m.
The outstanding investment required is 48.5m 2004: 59.6m.
Atkins obtained standby Letters of Credit from its bankers to support the deferred element of its commitment.
The fees for the standby Letters of Credit included an agreement to issue warrants in respect of 4,715,200 shares which represented 4.73% of Atkins issued share capital at the time, all of which were exercised during the year to 31 March 2004.
The cost of these warrants was 6.9m, representing the difference between the market price of the shares at Financial Close, 147p per share, and the amount payable on exercise of the warrants, being the nominal value of the shares issued of 0.5p per share.
This amount will be charged to the profit and loss account on a weighted average basis over the life of the Letters of Credit.
The contract The Metronet PPP companies have two separate 30-year performance-based contracts which together cover over two-thirds of the London 1 Underground network.
The contracts, which are split into four 7 2 year periods, cover inter alia the repairs, refurbishment and modernisation 1 of the infrastructure.
The contracts are subject to periodic review at the end of each 7 2 year period.
The periodic reviews allow for restating the scope of the work, the level of payment, the contractual terms and the performance requirements.
The Metronet PPP companies have contracted with Trans4m Ltd, a Joint Venture company in which Atkins has a 25% shareholding, to undertake 1 the civil engineering work and the refurbishment programme.
Trans4m Ltd has signed a 7 2 year contract with Atkins for premises and civil design, inspection and assessment work and the design and build of new communication systems.
The Metronet PPP companies revenues consist of a fixed element Underlying Infrastructure Service Charge which is adjusted for performance.
Performance is measured under three categories: capability, availability and ambience.
Shareholder returns are sensitive to these performance-based measures.
Consolidation of Metronets results In line with the Groups accounting policies on Joint Ventures, the results of Metronet have been accounted for under the gross equity method of accounting.
As part of its consolidation of the Metronet PPP companies balance sheets, Atkins initially recognised 8.7m of goodwill associated with liabilities inherited when the PPP companies were acquired from London Underground Limited.
This is being amortised over 20 years.
The charge for the year was 0.5m 2004: 0.4m.
In the year ended 31 March 2005 a provision of 14.0m was made for the financial impact of the potential late delivery of station improvements.
No account has been taken of the potential recovery through either extension of time or negotiated claims unless Metronet is virtually certain that such mitigations will be delivered.

The number of shares used for the fully diluted calculation is 100,550,490 2004: 97,668,548.
The options relate to the SAYE schemes, Equity Participation Plans and Long Term Incentive Plans.

2004 2001 Rate of inflation 3.00% 3.00% Real pension increases: Fixed 2.00% 2.00% Limited price indexation 0.00% 0.00% Real salary increases 1.50% 1.50% Real investment return: future service 4.00% 4.25% past service 4.10% 3.50% The most recent triennial full valuation of the Atkins Staff Scheme took place on 1 April 2004 based on the 2004 assumptions in the above table using the projected unit method.
The total market value of the assets at the date of the 2004 Valuation was 390.5m and the past service shortfall was 69.0m.
The value of the assets was sufficient to cover approximately 85% of the benefits that had accrued to members allowing for assumed future increases in salaries.
For the purposes of SSAP 24 the shortfall is being amortised as a level percentage of salary over the estimated service lives of current employees in the scheme through to 2016.
As the scheme is now closed to new entrants the current service costs, under the projected unit valuation method, will increase as a percentage of salary as members of the scheme approach retirement, although the overall cost of the scheme will decrease as the number of members decreases.
The most recent triennial full valuation of the Railways Pension Scheme took place at 31 December 2001 using the projected unit method.
A funding update was produced as at 1 April 2004, based on the 2004 assumptions in the above table.
The total market value of the assets at 1 April 2004 was sufficient to cover approximately 112% of the benefits that had accrued to members allowing for assumed future increases in salaries.
The excess of assets over accrued liabilities surplus of 12.0m is being amortised as a level percentage of salary over the estimated service lives of current employees in the Scheme through to 2016.
In addition there is a pension prepayment, representing the excess of the amount funded over the accumulated pension cost, of 2.5m 2004: 2.5m.
This has been netted with the pension provisions of the other defined benefit schemes and included in provisions for liabilities and charges.
Other pension schemes include the Atkins McCarthy Pension Scheme in the Republic of Ireland closed to new entrants and a range of defined contribution schemes or equivalent in a number of the overseas subsidiaries.

The Group made an additional contribution of 8.6m in January 2005 and intends to make additional contributions of approximately 10m per annum over the next two years.
No additional funding is currently required by the Railways Scheme.

The results of the full triennial valuation of the Railways Scheme as at 31 December 2004 will be available during the course of 2005 6.
A provision of 15.6m which incorporates the unfunded pension promise is included in provisions for liabilities and charges representing the excess of accumulated pension cost over the amount funded 2004: 23.5m.
