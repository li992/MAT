Changes in accounting policy and presentation During the 2005 financial year the group adopted UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts and the related amendments to UITF Abstract 17 revised 2003 Employee Share Schemes.
UITF 38 changes the presentation of an entitys own shares held in an ESOP trust from previously being held as assets to being deducted in arriving at shareholders funds.
UITF 17 revised 2003 requires the amounts recognised in the profit and loss account in respect of share awards previously based on the book value of shares held in the ESOP trusts to being based on the fair value of shares at the date the award is made.
An additional charge of 3 million and a credit of 16 million for the 2004 and 2003 financial years, respectively has been made to the group profit and loss account.
The effect on the groups balance sheet at 1 April 2002 has been to reduce xed assets by 177 million, to reduce other creditors by 25 million and to reduce shareholders funds by 152 million.
The prior year adjustment in the statement of total recognised gains and losses is 21 million.
Had we not adopted this change the charge to the profit and loss account would have been 18 million higher in the 2005 financial year.
A small number of changes in the presentation of the notes to the financial statements have been made and comparative gures have been restated accordingly as explained in the notes where material.

Its main services and products are xed voice and data calls, the provision of xed exchange lines to homes and businesses, the provision of communication services to other operators, the provision of private services to businesses and the supply of telecommunication equipment for customers premises.
The turnover of each line of business is derived as follows: & BT Retail derives its turnover from the supply of exchange lines and from the calls made over these lines, the provision of ICT products and services, the leasing of private circuits and other private services, the sale and rental of customer premises equipment to the groups UK customers and other lines of business and from its narrowband and broadband internet access products.
& BT Wholesale derives its turnover from providing network services and solutions to communications companies, including xed and mobile network operators, ISPs internet service providers and other service providers, including other BT lines of business, and from carrying transit trafc between telecommunications operators.
& BT Global Services mainly generates its turnover from the provision of ICT products and services, outsourcing and systems integration work and from the xed network operations of the groups European subsidiaries.
The business also derives revenues from providing web hosting facilities to end customers and through BT lines of business.
Segmented information on the lines of business is given below for the years ended 31 March 2005, 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2003 as required by the UK accounting standard SSAP 25 and the US accounting standard SFAS No.
There is extensive trading between the lines of business and profitability is dependent on the transfer price levels.
These intra-group trading arrangements and operating assets are subject to periodic review and have changed in some instances.
Comparative gures have been restated for these and other changes and in certain instances have been determined using apportionments and allocations.

Acquisitions and disposals continued a On 25 February 2005 the group acquired Infonet Services Corporation for total consideration of 520 million, including acquisition costs, 315 million net of cash in the business.
This gave rise to goodwill of 264 million.

Since the acquisition was made towards the end of the year ended 31 March 2005, the fair values of the identiable assets and liabilities have been determined on a provisional basis.
Goodwill arising on acquisition of Infonet is being amortised over 20 years.
In the period from 1 April 2004 to 24 February 2005 Infonet generated operating losses after tax of US$83 million year to 31 March 2004 US$66 million losses.
b In December 2004 the group agreed to acquire the 74% interest in Albacom SpA not already held, giving BT full ownership for total consideration of 131 million, including deferred consideration of 38 million.
The deferred consideration is dependent upon the financial performance of Albacom in the 2009 financial year and the minimum payable is 38 million.
This gave rise to goodwill of 9 million.
Prior to becoming a subsidiary undertaking, Albacom SpA was accounted for as a joint venture undertaking.
In accordance with FRS 2 Accounting for Subsidiary Undertakings, and in order to give a true and fair view, purchased goodwill has been calculated as the sum of the goodwill arising on each purchase of shares in Albacom, being the difference at the date of each purchase between the fair value of the consideration given and the fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities attributable to the interest purchased.
This represents a departure from the statutory method, under which goodwill is calculated as the difference between cost and fair value on the date that Albacom became a subsidiary undertaking.
The statutory method would not give a true and fair view because it would result in the groups share of Albacoms retained reserves, during the period that it was a joint venture undertaking, being recharacterised as goodwill.
The effect of this departure is to reduce retained profits by 313 million, and to reduce purchased goodwill by 313 million.
Fair value Book value adjustments Fair value m m m Fixed assets 378 11 367 Current assets 211 211 Current liabilities 301 14 315 Long-term debt 139 139 Minority interest 2 2 Groups share of original book value and fair value of net assets 147 25 122 Goodwill 9 Total cost 131 The fair value adjustments include the elimination of goodwill recorded in the books of Albacom and the revaluation of lease obligations to fair value.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Albacom is being amortised over 20 years.
In the period from 1 April 2004 to 3 February 2005 Albacom generated operating losses after tax of E195 million year to 31 March 2004 E263 million losses.

The net liabilities acquired amounted to 1 million giving rise to goodwill of 18 million which is being amortised over a period of 5 years.
On 15 March 2004 the group acquired controlling interest in Transcomm plc for consideration of 15 million.
The groups share of the net assets acquired was 2 million giving rise to goodwill of 13 million which is being amortised over a period of 13 years.
On 13 January 2004 the group took full control of Siosistemi SpA for consideration of 4 million including deferred consideration of 1 million.
Net assets of 1 million were acquired giving rise to goodwill of 4 million which is being amortised over a period of 10 years.
e On completion of the unwind of Concert on 1 April 2002, the former Concert businesses, customer accounts and networks were returned to the two parent companies with BT and AT&T each taking ownership of substantially those parts of the Concert global venture originally contributed by them.
As part of the settlement with AT&T for the unwind of the Concert global venture BT received net cash of US$72 million 56 million.
This net settlement included the receipt of US$350 million reflecting the allocation of the businesses and the payment of US$278 million to achieve the equal division of specified working capital and other liability balances.
The results of the acquired businesses, both pre and post acquisition, cannot be separately identified and, therefore, cannot be reported.

Accordingly there is no further profit or loss on the unwind and no goodwill on the acquisition.

At 31 March 2005, other than disclosed below there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the ordinary course of the groups business and on these no material losses are anticipated.
The group has insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by O2 UK Limited prior to its demerger with O2 on 19 November 2001.
O2 plc has given BT a counterindemnity for these guarantees.
The maximum likely exposure is US$76 million 41 million as at 31 March 2005, although this could increase by a further US$563 million, 298 million in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until O2 UK Ltd has discharged all its obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
The company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings which would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the group.
Proceedings have been initiated in Italy against 21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection with the Italian UMTS auction.
Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction process.
The hearings are continuing, in Rome.
If the proceedings are successful, BT could be held liable, with others, for any damages.
The company has concluded that it is not appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such potential claim.
The European Commission is formally investigating the way the UK Government has set BTs property rates and those paid by Kingston Communications.
The Commission is examining whether the Government has complied with EC Treaty rules on state aid in assessing BTs rates.
BTs rates were set by the Valuation Ofce after lengthy discussions based on well established principles, in a transparent process.
In BTs view, any allegation of state aid is groundless and BT is confident that the Government will demonstrate the fairness of the UK ratings system.
A nding against HM Government could result in BT having to repay any amount of state aid it may be determined to have received.
The company has concluded that it is not appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such potential nding.
Pension costs Background The group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
In addition, disclosures have been presented in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard No.
The group offers retirement plans to its employees.
The groups main scheme, the BT Pension Scheme BTPS, is a dened benefit scheme where the benets are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
The BTPS is funded through a legally separate trustee administered fund.
This scheme has been closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001 and replaced by a dened contribution scheme.
Under this dened contribution scheme the profit and loss charge represents the contribution payable by the group based upon a xed percentage of employees pay.
The total pension costs of the group expensed within staff costs in the year was 465 million 2004 404 million, 2003 322 million, of which 430 million 2004 376 million, 2003 306 million related to the groups main dened benefit pension scheme, the BTPS.
The increase in the pension cost in the 2005 financial year reects the introduction of Smart Pensions, a salary sacrifice scheme under which employees elect to stop making employee contributions and for the company to make additional contributions in return for a reduction in gross contractual pay.
As a result there has been a switch between wages and salaries and pension costs of 99 million in the year.
The increase in the pension cost in the 2004 financial year reects the amortisation charge for the pension deficit partly offset by a reduction in the number of active members of the BTPS and the interest credit relating to the balance sheet prepayment.
This total pension cost includes the cost of providing enhanced pension benets to leavers, which amounted to nil 2004 1 million, 2003 60 million.
The pension cost applicable to the groups main dened contribution schemes in the year ended 31 March 2005 was 11 million 2004 7 million, 2003 4 million and 1.2 million 2004 0.7 million, 2003 0.4 million of contributions to the schemes were outstanding at 31 March 2005.
The group occupies four properties owned by the scheme on which an annual rental of 7 million is payable.
The BTPS assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, UK and overseas properties, xed interest and index linked securities, deposits and short-term investments.
At 31 March 2005, the UK equities included 17 million 2004 33 million, 2003 37 million ordinary shares of the company with a market value of 36 million 2004 58 million, 2003 58 million.
Notes to the financial statements BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 97 28.
Pension costs continued BT Pension Scheme Funding valuation A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent scheme trustees by a professionally qualied independent actuary, using the projected unit method.
The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.
The triennial valuation as at 31 December 2002 forms the basis of determining the groups pension fund contributions for the year ending 31 March 2005 and future periods until the next valuation is completed.
The funding valuation is performed at 31 December because this is the financial year end of the BTPS.
The valuation basis for funding purposes is broadly as follows: & scheme assets are valued at market value at the valuation date: and & scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the estimated rate of return reecting the assets of the scheme.
The last three triennial valuations were determined using the following long-term assumptions: Real rates per annum Nominal rates per annum 2002 1999 1996 2002 1999 1996 valuation valuation valuation valuation valuation valuation % % % % % % Return on existing assets, relative to market values 4.52 2.38 3.80 7.13 5.45 7.95 after allowing for an annual increase in dividends of 1.00 1.00 0.75 3.53 4.03 4.78 Return on future investments 4.00 4.00 4.25 6.60 7.12 8.42 Average increase in retail price index 2.50 3.00 4.00 Average future increases in wages and salaries 1.50 1.75 1.75 4.04 4.80 5.82 Average increase in pensions 2.50 3.00 3.75-4.00 There is a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 1.25% for the first three years.
The mortality assumption reects improvements in life expectancy since the 1999 valuation and incorporates further future improvements.
The assumed rate of investment return, salary increases and mortality all have a significant effect on the funding valuation.
A 0.25 percentage point change in these assumptions would have the following effects on the funding deficit: Impact on funding deficit Increase Decrease bn bn 0.25 percentage point change in: Investment return 0.9 0.9 Wage and salary increases 0.2 0.2 An additional year of life expectancy would result in a 0.7 billion increase in the deficit.
At 31 December 2002, the assets of the BTPS had a market value of 22.8 billion 1999 29.7 billion and were sufficient to cover 91.6% 1999 96.8% of the benets accrued by that date, after allowing for expected future increases in wages and salaries but not taking into account the costs of providing incremental pension benets for employees leaving under release schemes since that date.
This represents a funding deficit of 2.1 billion compared to 1.0 billion at 31 December 1999.
The funding valuation uses conservative assumptions whereas, had the valuation been based on the actuarys view of the median estimate basis, the funding deficit would have been reduced to 0.4 billion.
Although the market value of equity investments had fallen, the investment income and contributions received by the scheme exceeded the benets paid by 0.3 billion in the year ended 31 December 2002.
As a result of the triennial funding valuation the group agreed to make employers contributions at a rate of 12.2% of pensionable pay from April 2003 and annual deficiency payments of 232 million.
This compared to the employers contribution rate of 11.6% and annual deficiency payments of 200 million that were determined under the 1999 funding valuation.
In the year ended 31 March 2005, the group made regular contributions of 376 million 2004 284 million, 2003 278 million and additional special contributions for enhanced pension benets to leavers in the year ended 31 December 2003 of 6 million 2004 130 million, 2003 129 million and deficiency contributions of nil 2004 612 million, 2003 200 million as a result of the early payment of 380 million made in the 2004 financial year that was scheduled for payment in subsequent years.
Under the terms of the trust deed that governs the BTPS the group is required to have a funding plan that should address the deficit over a maximum period of 20 years whilst the agreed funding plan addresses the deficit over a period of 15 years.
The group will continue to make deficiency payments until the deficit is made good.
The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001 and the age prole of active members will consequently increase.
Under the projected unit method, the current service cost, as a proportion of the active members pensionable salaries, is expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Despite the scheme being closed to new entrants, the projected payment prole extends over more than 60 years.

Pension costs continued SSAP 24 accounting valuation The SSAP 24 valuation is broadly on the following basis: & scheme assets are valued at market value: and & scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the estimated rate of return reecting the assets of the scheme.
The pension cost for the 2003 financial year was based on the SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2000.
At 31 March 2000 there was a SSAP 24 deficit of 0.2 billion and the regular cost for the 2003 and 2002 financial years was 11.6% of pensionable salaries.
The SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2000 was based on the same assumptions as the December 1999 funding valuation, with the exception that, over the long term, it has been assumed that the return on the existing assets of the scheme, relative to market values, would be a nominal 5.6% per annum which equates to a real return of 2.5% per annum.
The pension costs for the 2005 and 2004 financial years were based upon the SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2003.
At 31 March 2003 there was a SSAP 24 deficit of 1.4 billion, before taking account of the balance sheet prepayment and the regular cost is 11.3% of pensionable salaries.
The SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2003 is based on the 31 December 2002 funding valuation rolled forward, and uses the same assumptions as set out above, with the following exceptions: & return on existing assets is assumed to be a nominal 7.1% per annum, which equates to a real return of 4.7%: & average increase in retail price index is assumed to be 2.25% per annum: and & the average future increases in wages and salaries is assumed to include a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 0.75% for the first three years, before returning to 1.5%.
The cumulative difference since the adoption of SSAP 24 between the cash contributions paid by the group to the pension scheme and the profit and loss charge is reected on the balance sheet.
The cumulative cash contributions exceed the profit and loss charge and the resulting difference is shown as a prepayment on the balance sheet.
At 31 March 2005 the prepayment was 1,118 million 2004 1,172 million.
The pension charge to the profit and loss account will also include the amortisation of the combined pension fund position and pension prepayment over the average remaining service lives of scheme members, which amounts to 13 years, and the cost of enhanced pension benets provided to leavers.
FRS 17 Retirement benets The group continues to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
Full implementation of FRS 17 has been deferred by the Accounting Standards Board and would have applied to the group for the 2006 financial year.
However, in the 2006 financial year the group will adopt International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The requirements for disclosure under FRS 17 remain in force between its issue and adoption of IFRS, and the required information is set out below.
FRS 17 species how key assumptions should be derived and applied.
These assumptions are often different to the assumptions adopted by the pension scheme actuary and trustees in determining the funding position of pension schemes.
The accounting requirements under FRS 17 are broadly as follows: & scheme assets are valued at market value at the balance sheet date: & scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability: and & movement in the scheme surplus deficit is split between operating charges and nancing items in the profit and loss account and, in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, actuarial gains and losses.
The financial assumptions used to calculate the BTPS liabilities under FRS 17 at 31 March 2005 are: Real rates per annum Nominal rates per annum 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 % % % % % % Average future increases in wages and salaries 1.00 1.00 1.50 3.73 3.63 3.78 Average increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.70 2.60 2.25 Rate used to discount scheme liabilities 2.63 2.83 3.08 5.40 5.50 5.40 Ination average increase in retail price index 2.70 2.60 2.25 There is a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 0.75% for the first year 2004 two years, 2003 three years.

The net pension deficit set out below under FRS 17 is as if this standard was fully applied.
The fair value of the BTPS assets, the present value of the BTPS liabilities based on the financial assumptions set out above, and the resulting deficit, together with those of unfunded pension liabilities at 31 March 2005 and 31 March 2004 are shown below.
The fair value of the BTPS assets is not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before it is realised.
The present value of the liabilities is derived from long-term cash ow projections and is thus inherently uncertain.

Employee share plans The company has an employee share investment plan, and savings-related share option plans for its employees and those of participating subsidiaries, further share option plans for selected group employees and an employee stock purchase plan for employees in the United States.
It also has several share plans for executives.
Share option schemes On the demerger of O2, BTs share option plans ceased to operate and were replaced by similar BT Group Employee Sharesave plans and the BT Group Global Share Option Plan.
The BT Group Legacy Option Plan was operated on 17 December 2001 following the scheme of arrangement and demerger in November 2001.
Replacement unapproved options over BT Group shares were granted to all participants in the executive option plans who had released their options over British Telecommunications plc shares.
The value of the replacement options was determined by averaging the combined prices of BT Group plc and O2 plc shares over the 20 dealing days following the demerger on 19 November 2001.
This resulted in a factor of 1.3198 being applied to the former option over British Telecommunications plc shares in order to give the number of BT Group shares under the new option.
The option prices of the original options were also adjusted to take account of the different number of shares under option.

Employee share plans continued In the year ended 31 March 2005, options over 31 million shares were granted under the BT Group Global Share Option Plan.
The options will be exercisable subject to continued employment and meeting corporate performance targets, on the third anniversary of the date of grant.
Options outstanding under these share option plans at 31 March 2005 and 2004, together with their exercise prices and dates, were as follows: 2005 2004 Option price 2005 Option price 2004 Normal dates of exercise per share millions per share millions BT Group Employee Sharesave plans 2005 218p255p 20 218p255p 26 2006 154p173p 22 154p173p 30 2007 146p227p 57 218p227p 54 2008 154p 92 154p 123 2009 146p 71 Total 262 233 a BT Group Legacy Option Plan 2001-2011 318p602p 15 318p602p 16 Total 15 16 BT Group Global Share Option Plan 2004-2014 176p199.5p 59 176p199.5p 63 2005-2012 163p263p 51 163p263p 61 2006-2014 176p199.5p 51 176p199.5p 54 2007-2015 179p215p 30 Total 191 178 Total outstanding options 468 427 a The option prices of shares under the BT Group Legacy Option Plan were adjusted at the time of the demerger as detailed on page 102.
The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year ended 31 March 2005 has been estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option pricing model.
The following weighted average assumptions were used in that model: an expected life extending one month later than the first exercise date: estimated annualised dividend yield of approximately 5% 2004 5%, 2003 5% : risk free interest rates of approximately 5% 2004 4%, 2003 5% : and expected volatility of approximately 25% 2004 25%, 2003 40%.
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in the year ended 31 March 2005 was 41p 2004 42p, 2003 55p for Sharesave options exercisable three years after the date of grant and 52p 2004 51p, 2003 72p for Sharesave options exercisable five years after the date of grant.
The BT Group Global Share Option Plan and the BT Group Incentive Share Plan an executive share plan were valued using Monte Carlo simulations.
The weighted average fair value of options granted under the BT Group Global Share Option Plan has been estimated as 36p.
The weighted average fair value of awards of shares granted under the Incentive Share Plan has been estimated as 98p.
The total value of share options granted by BT in the year ended 31 March 2005 was 77 million 2004 136 million, 2003 41 million.
In accordance with UK accounting practices, no compensation expense is recognised for options granted where the exercise price equals the market price at date of grant, or options granted under approved Sharesave plans.

Options granted, exercised and lapsed under these share option plans during the years ended 31 March 2003, 2004 and 2005 and options exercisable at 31 March 2003, 2004 and 2005 were as follows: Savings Executive Weighted related option Exercise average schemes plans Total price exercise millions millions millions range price Outstanding, 31 March 2003 164 85 249 163p727p 231p Granted 165 119 284 154p199.5p 175p Lapsed 96 10 106 154p716p 220p Outstanding, 31 March 2004 233 194 427 154p727p 196p Granted 91 31 122 146p215p 160p Lapsed 62 19 81 146p602p 189p Outstanding, 31 March 2005 262 206 468 146p602p 188p Exercisable, 31 March 2003 11 11 255p727p 491p Exercisable, 31 March 2004 13 13 255p727p 476p Exercisable, 31 March 2005 16 34 50 199.5p602p 288p Notes to the financial statements BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 103 31.
Employee share plans continued Incentive Share Plan and Retention Share Plan The BT Incentive Share Plan ISP and the BT Retention Share Plan RSP were introduced for employees of the group in 2000.
Under the plans, company shares are acquired by an employee share ownership trust and are conditionally awarded to participants.
Under the ISP participants are normally only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three-year period if the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measure and if the participants are still employed by the group.
If the company has exceeded the pre-determined corporate performance measure the participants may be awarded up to double the shares conditionally awarded.
The corporate performance measure is BTs total shareholder return TSR measured against a group of companies from the European Telecom Sector at the beginning of the relevant performance period.
The ISP was operated in the 2005 financial year with 1,406 participants receiving awards over 12,654,013 shares.
The ISP was not operated in the 2004 financial year.
Under the RSP the length of retention period before awards vest is exible.
Awards may vest in annual tranches.
The shares are transferred at the end of a specified period, only if the individual is still employed by the group.
During the 2005 financial year 1,340,256 2004 720,472 shares vested in 11 2004 7 participants in the RSP.
Deferred Bonus Plan The BT Deferred Bonus Plan DBP was established in 1998 and awards are granted annually to employees of the group.
Under this plan, shares in the company are acquired by an employee share ownership trust and transferred to participants at the end of three years if he or she has continued to be employed by the group throughout that period.
On 2 August 2004, 1,280,934 shares 1 August 2003 653,899 were transferred to 219 participants 1 August 2003 225 at the end of the three-year deferred period.
At 31 March 2005, 27.8 million shares 2004 30.5 million shares in the company were held in trust for employee share plans, of which 12.7 million shares 2004 no shares were held for the ISP, 2.8 million shares 2004 3.0 million shares were held for the RSP and 7.9 million shares 2004 6.5 million shares were held for the DBP.
Dividends or dividend equivalents earned on the shares during the conditional periods are reinvested in company shares for the potential benefit of the participants.

These shares had a nominal value of 0.2 million and a market value of 9.3 million at 31 March 2005.
The values of possible future transfers of shares under the plans were based on the BT Group plc share price at 31 March 2005 of 205.5p 2004 177p.
The provisions for the costs of the ISP and RSP were based on best estimates of the companys performance over the plans conditional periods, relating to those portions of the plan conditional periods from commencement up to the financial year end.

Employee share plans continued Employee Share Investment Plan From December 2001 the BT Group Employee Share Investment Plan ESIP has been in operation.
The ESIP, which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs, gives UK employees an opportunity to purchase shares partnership shares monthly out of pre-tax salary up to a maximum value of 1,500 per year.
During the 2005 financial year, 6.1 million shares 2004 6.0 million shares, including 0.2 million shares purchased by dividend reinvestment, were purchased by the Trustee of the ESIP on behalf of 13,017 2004 13,974 employees at a total cost of 11.7 million 2004 11.1 million.
The free shares element of the ESIP allows BT to provide free shares to UK employees which are held in trust for at least three years.
A phantom plan, which delivers cash awards equivalent to the value of the free shares, operates for employees outside the UK.
In 2005, 0.5% of pre-tax profits, amounting to 11 million, was allocated to the ESIP and the phantom plan for employees outside the UK 2004 20 million.
Up to 2% of pre tax profits would have been available subject to meeting two corporate performance targets: one of increasing earnings per share before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items by 8% and the other of reducing customer dissatisfaction by 25% on a compound annual basis over the past three years.
Although these targets were not met, a discretionary payment was made.
The ESIP replaced the BT Employee Share Ownership Scheme which operated for employee profit sharing until 2001.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan The BT Group Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP for employees in the US enables participants to purchase ADSs quarterly at a price the Base Option Price which is 85% of the market price of an ADS at the start of the offer or, in the case of employees who join the ESPP after the start of the offer, 85% of the market price on their eligibility date, whichever is higher.
Up to 15 May 2005, 934,782 shares 93,478 ADSs have been transferred to participants out of treasury under the ESPP up to 15 May 2004, 69,164 new shares were issued and 226,218 shares were transferred out of treasury.
The second offer, with a Base Option Price of US$25.61 ended in December 2004.
A third offer was launched in December 2004 with a Base Option Price of US$31.52 and will run until December 2005.
Auditors The auditors remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2005 for the group was 4,396,000 2004 3,790,000, 2003 2,943,000.

In order to maintain the independence of the external auditors, the Board has determined policies as to what non audit services can be provided by the companys external auditors and the approval processes related to them.
Under those policies work of a consultancy nature will not be offered to the external auditors unless there are clear efficiencies and value added benets to the company.
BTs regulatory obligations require it to publish audited regulatory financial statements.
The fees for regulatory work principally reect the audit fees associated with those regulatory financial statements.
The fees for tax services include tax compliance and tax advisory services.
The fees for systems advice in the year ended 31 March 2003 related to advisory services provided in connection with the implementation of certain billing systems.
These services, which were provided by PwC Consulting, the consulting business of  that was sold to IBM in October 2002, commenced in 2002 and were completed in 2003.
Notes to the financial statements BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 105 33.
Financial instruments and risk management The group holds or issues financial instruments mainly to finance its operations: for the temporary investment of shortterm funds: and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments for example trade debtors and trade creditors arise directly from the groups operations.
The group nances its operations primarily by a mixture of issued share capital, retained profits, deferred taxation, long-term loans and short-term loans, principally by issuing commercial paper and medium-term notes.
The group borrows in the major long-term debt markets in major currencies.
Typically, but not exclusively, the bond markets provide the most cost-effective means of long-term borrowing.
The group uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its exposure to market risks from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.
The derivatives used for this purpose are principally interest rate swaps, gilt locks, currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The types of financial instrument used for investment of short-term funds are prescribed in group treasury policies with limits on the exposure to any one organisation.
Short-term investing in financial instruments is undertaken on behalf of the group by substantial external fund managers who are limited to dealing in debt instruments and certain dened derivative instruments and are given strict guidelines on credit, diversication and maturity proles.
During the year ended 31 March 2005, the groups net debt reduced from 8.4 billion to 7.8 billion mainly from working capital inows and proceeds from the sale of investments.
During the 2005 financial year, the group restructured some of its swaps portfolio.
As a result, the group terminated 2.9 billion of cross-currency and sterling interest rate swaps with some swaps being replaced with new swaps which had the same economic hedging effect.
This resulted in the group paying 107 million in reducing gross debt and receiving a net 14 million of interest receipts.
The interest receipts and payments on restructuring have been included within deferred income and other debtors respectively and will be amortised to the profit and loss account over the term of the underlying hedged debt.
The groups xed:oating interest rate prole on net debt is 95:5 at 31 March 2005.
During the year ended 31 March 2004, the groups net debt reduced from 9.6 billion to 8.4 billion mainly from working capital inows.
During the 2004 financial year, the group restructured some of its swaps portfolio to mitigate credit risk to certain counter parties.
As a result, the group terminated 7 billion of cross-currency interest rate swaps and replaced these with new swaps which had the same economic hedging effect.
This resulted in the group paying 445 million in reducing gross debt and receiving 420 million of interest.
The interest receipt has been included in deferred income and will be amortised to the profit and loss account over the term of the underlying debt.
The groups xed:oating interest rate prole on net debt was 76:24 at 31 March 2004.
During the year ended 31 March 2003, the groups net debt reduced from 13.7 billion to 9.6 billion.
2.6 billion was realised from the disposal of the groups interest in Cegetel Groupe SA in the year, and the group has closed out 2.6 billion of associated xed interest rate swaps.
The groups xed:oating interest rate prole on net debt therefore remained at 88:12 at 31 March 2003.
The group uses financial instruments to hedge some of its currency exposures arising from its non-UK assets, liabilities and forward purchase commitments.
The group also hedges some of its interest liabilities.
The financial instruments used comprise borrowings in foreign currencies, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, gilt locks and interest and currency swaps.
There has been no change in the nature of the groups risk prole between 31 March 2005 and the date of these financial statements.
The notional amounts of derivatives summarised below do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not necessarily a measure of the exposure of the group through its use of derivatives.
The amounts exchanged are calculated on the notional amounts and other terms of the derivatives which relate to interest and exchange rates.
a Interest rate risk management The group has entered into interest rate swap agreements with banks and other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are xed.
Under interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the differences between xed rate and oating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
Under gilt locks, forward sales of UK government long-dated treasury stock were entered into for periods of up to one year.
This hedge effectively xed in the interest on part of the groups then future borrowings, all of which have now been taken on.
At 31 March 2005, the group had outstanding interest rate swap agreements having a total notional principal amount of 5,297 million 2004 5,210 million.
b Foreign exchange risk management Cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts have been entered into to reduce the foreign currency exposure on the groups operations and the groups net assets.
The group also enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge investments, interest expense and purchase and sale commitments denominated in foreign currencies principally US dollars and the euro.
The remaining terms of the currency swaps are up to 26 years and the terms of currency forward exchange contracts are typically less than one year.
The purpose of the groups foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that the eventual net inows and net outows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
At 31 March 2005, the group had outstanding foreign currency swap agreements and forward exchange contracts having a total notional principal amount of 9,819 million 2004 11,367 million.
106 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 Notes to the financial statements 33.
Financial instruments and risk management continued The values of forward foreign currency contracts at 31 March 2005 were 427 million 2004 301 million for purchases of currency and 782 million 2004 1,223 million for sales of currency.
These values have been estimated by calculating their present values using the market discount rates, appropriate to the terms of the contracts, in effect at the balance sheet dates.
At 31 March 2005, the group had deferred unrealised gains of 2 million 2004 nil and losses of nil 2004 5 million, based on dealer-quoted prices, from hedging purchase and sale commitments, and in addition had deferred realised net losses of 5 million 2004 3 million gains.
These are included in the profit and loss account as part of the hedged purchase or sale transaction when it is recognised, or as gains or losses when a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur.
c Concentrations of credit risk and credit exposures of financial instruments The group considers that it is not exposed to major concentrations of credit risk.
The group, however, is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
The group limits the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty.
The group does not normally see the need to seek collateral or other security.
The long-term debt instruments issued in December 2000 and February 2001 both contained covenants that if the group credit rating was downgraded below A3 in the case of Moodys or below A minus in the case of S&P, additional interest would accrue from the next interest coupon period at the rate of 0.25 percentage points for each ratings category adjustment by each ratings agency.
In May 2001, Moodys downgraded BTs credit rating to Baa1, which increased BTs interest charge by approximately 32 million per annum.
BTs current credit rating from S&P is A minus.
Based upon the total debt of 9 billion outstanding on these instruments at 31 March 2005, BTs annual interest charge would increase by approximately 26 million if BTs credit ratings were to be downgraded by one credit rating category by both agencies below a long-term debt rating of Baa1 A minus.
If BTs credit rating with Moodys was to be upgraded by one credit rating category the annual interest charge would be reduced by approximately 13 million.
d Fair value of financial instruments The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of the groups financial instruments at 31 March 2005 and 2004.
The carrying amounts are included in the group balance sheet under the indicated headings, with the exception of derivative amounts, which are included in debtors or other creditors or as part of net debt as appropriate.
The fair values of the financial instruments are the amount at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in forced or liquidation sale.

The carrying amount of the other short-term deposits and investments approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the instruments held.
b The fair values of listed fixed asset investments were estimated based on quoted market prices for those investments.
c The fair value of the groups bonds, debentures, notes and other long-term borrowings has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with the same maturities where they existed, and on calculations of the present value of future cash flows using the appropriate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, where market prices of similar issues did not exist.
d The fair value of the groups outstanding foreign currency and interest rate swap agreements was estimated by calculating the present value, using appropriate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, of affected future cash flows translated, where appropriate, into pounds sterling at the market rates in effect at the balance sheet dates.
