22 Pensions and similar obligations Description of plans In many countries the Group operates dened benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
The majority of these plans are externally funded.
The Group also provides other post-employment benets, mainly post-employment medical plans in the United States.
These plans are predominantly unfunded.
The Group also operates a number of dened contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds.
Accounting policies Operating and nancing costs of dened benefit plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are systematically spread over the service lives of employees, and nancing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The costs of individual events such as past service benefit enhancements, settlements and curtailments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The liabilities and, where applicable, the assets of dened benefit plans are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet.
The fair value of plan liabilities includes allowance for expected increases in retirement pensions where these are either required by law or by the plan rules, or where such increases are regularly awarded.
The charges to the income statement for dened contribution plans are the company contributions payable and the assets of such plans are not included in the Group balance sheet.
All dened benefit plans are subject to regular actuarial review using the projected unit method, either by external consultants or by actuaries employed by Unilever.
Group policy is that the most important plans, representing over 75% of the dened benefit liabilities, are formally valued every year: other principal plans, accounting for approximately a further 15% of liabilities, have their liabilities updated each year.
Group policy for the remaining plans requires a full actuarial valuation at least every three years.
Asset values for all plans are updated every year.
Healthcare In December 2003 the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernisation Act became law in the US.
Under the provisions of this Act, the Groups US healthcare benefit plans are able to benefit from a subsidy towards the cost of prescription drugs.
Following a review of our healthcare plans in 2004, we determined that the benets of this legislation were immediately available to all except one of our plans without any amendment to those plans.
During 2005 it has been established that the remaining plan also benets.
As a consequence, a reduction in liability of 52 million was recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense in 2004 and a further 13 million in 2005.
The impact on the ongoing service cost is a reduction by an immaterial amount.
114 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 22 Pensions and similar obligations continued IAS 19 Disclosures Assumptions With the objective of presenting the assets and liabilities of the pensions and other post-employment benefit plans at their fair value on the balance sheet, assumptions under IAS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations vary according to the country in which the plan is situated.
The following table shows the assumptions, weighted by liabilities, used to value the principal dened benefit pension plans covering approximately 90% of pension liabilities the principal pension plans and plans providing other post-employment benets, and in addition the expected long-term rates of return on assets, weighted by asset value.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans.
A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effect: million million 1% point 1% point increase decrease Effect on total of service and interest cost components 7 6 Effect on total benefit obligation 78 69 The expected rate of return on plan assets was determined, based on actuarial advice, by a process that takes the long-term rates of return on government bonds available at the balance sheet date and applies to these rates suitable risk premiums that take account of historic market returns and current market long-term expectations for each asset class.
Demographic assumptions, such as mortality rates, are set having regard to the latest trends in life expectancy, plan experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension plans.
For the most important pension plans, representing over 75% of all dened benefit plans by liabilities, the assumptions used at 31 December 2005, 2004 and 2003 were: United Kingdom Netherlands Other Assumptions 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Discount rate 4.7% 5.3% 5.4% 4.0% 4.5% 5.2% Ination 2.7% 2.8% 2.7% 1.8% 1.8% 1.8% Rate of increase in salaries 4.2% 4.3% 4.2% 2.3% 2.3% 2.5% Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.7% 2.9% 2.8% 1.8% 1.8% 1.8% Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 2.7% 2.9% 2.8% 1.8% 1.8% 1.8% Expected long-term rates of return: Equities 7.6% 8.0% 8.3% 7.0% 7.6% 8.3% Bonds 4.5% 5.0% 5.3% 3.7% 4.1% 4.7% Property 6.1% 6.5% 6.8% 5.5% 6.1% 6.8% Others 6.7% 7.2% 4.3% 3.7% 3.5% 3.2% Weighted average asset return 6.9% 7.3% 7.6% 6.0% 6.6% 7.3% Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2005 115 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 22 Pensions and similar obligations continued United States Germany 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Discount rate 5.5% 5.7% 6.1% 4.0% 4.5% 5.2% Ination 2.4% 2.5% 2.5% 1.8% 1.8% 1.8% Rate of increase in salaries 4.0% 4.5% 4.5% 2.5% 2.5% 2.5% Rate of increase for pensions in payment 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 1.8% 1.8% 1.8% Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Expected long-term rates of return: Equities 8.0% 8.4% 8.6% 7.0% 7.6% 8.3% Bonds 4.8% 4.7% 4.7% 3.7% 4.1% 4.7% Property 6.5% 6.9% n a 5.5% 6.1% 6.8% Others 4.2% 2.1% n a 3.7% 3.7% 3.7% Weighted average asset return 7.0% 7.3% 7.4% 5.3% 5.7% 6.1% Mortality assumptions for these countries are based on the following post-retirement mortality tables: i United Kingdom: PMA 92 and PFA 92 with short cohort adjustment and scaling factor of 125% applied, projected to 2015 for current pensioners and to 2025 for future pensioners: ii the Netherlands: GBMV 1995-2000 : iii United States: RP2000 with a projection period of 10-15 years: and iv Germany: Heubeck 1998 Periodentafel with a scaling factor of 85%.
Assumptions for the remaining dened benefit plans vary considerably, depending on the economic conditions of the country where they are situated.

The accounting methodology however is not the same as under IAS 19, since under US GAAP all costs are recognised in operating profit and certain cost items are amortised in the income statement rather than recognised immediately.
The disclosures below show the benefit obligations, assets, funded status and balance sheet impact, as well as the periodic expense, cash ows and related economic assumptions associated with the dened benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans as computed in accordance with FAS 87 and FAS 106.
Measurement dates All plan assets are valued at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Liabilities in respect of the most important pension plans, comprising approximately 75% of the pension liabilities, are subject to actuarial valuations every year.
The valuations use membership data for the current year with the liability projected forward to the balance sheet date.
Valuations of all other plans are carried out every three years and in the case of the other principal pension plans, comprising approximately a further 15% of the liabilities, the valuations are updated each year.

Investment strategy The Groups investment strategy in respect of its funded pension plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory requirements of the territories where the plans are based.
The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the company of the benets provided.
To achieve this, investments are well diversied, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
The plans invest the largest proportion of the assets in equities which the Group believes offer the best returns over the long term commensurate with an acceptable level of risk.
The Group also keeps a proportion of assets invested in property, bonds and cash.
Most assets are managed by a number of external fund managers with a small proportion managed in-house.
Unilever has recently launched a pooled investment vehicle Univest which it believes will offer its pension plans around the world a simplied investment solution to implement their strategic asset allocation models initially for equities.
The aim is to provide a high quality, well diversied risk-controlled solution.
