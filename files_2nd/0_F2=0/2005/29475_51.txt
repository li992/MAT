EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS As stated in note 1, these are the Groups first financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The accounting policies set out in note 1 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005, the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 and in the preparation of the opening IFRS balance at 1 January 2004, the Groups date of transition to IFRSs.
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards does allow a number of exemptions or elections on adoption of IFRS for the first time, and the Group has taken advantage of the following provisions: The Group has elected not to apply the provisions of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment to options and equity instruments granted on or before 7 November 2002 or to equity instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002 that had vested before 1 January 2005.
The Group has also elected not to apply the provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations prior to the date of transition, and no adjustments have therefore been made for business combinations prior to 1 January 2004.
The Group has elected to restate owner occupied property at fair value at 1 January 2004 and to treat this fair value as the deemed cost at that date.
The Group has not taken advantage of the exemption from the requirement to restate comparative information in the first year of adoption of IFRS for IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet the Group has adjusted amounts previously reported in its financial statements prepared in accordance with its former basis of accounting, UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRSs has affected the Groups financial position, financial performance and cash flows is set out in the following tables and the accompanying commentary.
This transition statement differs from that initially published by the Group on 26 July 2005 principally as a result of the further refinement of the Groups approach to the analysis of contracts between investment and insurance and the treatment of tax within the Groups UK unit linked funds.
The restated profit after tax and net assets are unaffected.

No changes, other than the reanalysis under IFRS format, have been made to the numbers previously reported for UK GAAP.
b Accounting for Investment Contracts Under UK GAAP all long-term contracts written by an insurance company are accounted for on a similar basis.
Under IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts products are classified for accounting purposes between insurance and investment contracts, depending on the level of insurance risk assumed, and the liabilities for insurance and investment contracts are disclosed separately within the balance sheet.
Amounts receivable under investment contracts are no longer shown as premiums in the income statement but are treated as deposits and added to investment contract liabilities.
Similarly amounts payable under investment contracts are not recorded as claims in the income statement but as deductions from investment contract liabilities.
None of these reclassification adjustments has any impact on profit after tax or shareholders equity.
In addition, however, under UK GAAP the Group held certain reserves on products that are now classified as investment contracts.
These reserves are released under IFRS.
The impact is to decrease profit after tax by 7.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2004, with a 2.6 million increase in shareholders equity 10.3 million at 1 January 2004. c Deferred Acquisition Costs and Deferred Income DAC DIR Revenue and expense for investment contracts are recognised in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
Under IAS 18, revenue arising from investment contracts must be recognised over the life of the contract and an explicit deferred income liability is recognised for any front end fees which relate to services to be provided in future periods.
Under UK GAAP no such liability is recognised and front end fees are recognised when received.
The recognition of deferred income net of the associated deferred tax asset decreases shareholders equity by 186.4m at 31 December 2004 179.1 million at 1 January 2004 and decreases profit after tax by 7.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2004.
In addition under IAS 18 Revenue only directly attributable incremental acquisition costs are deferred.
However the introduction of IFRS significantly extends the range of investment contracts where costs may be deferred.
This deferral of additional acquisition costs net of the associated deferred tax liability has increased shareholders equity by 183.0 million at 31 December 2004 163.3 million at 1 January 2004 and increased profit after tax by 19.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Consequently, the aggregate deferred income and deferred acquisition cost adjustments have decreased shareholders equity by 3.4 million as at 31 December 2004 15.8 million at 1 January 2004, and increased profit after tax by 12.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2004. d Unit Linked Asset Analysis and Valuation There are a number of adjustments associated with the presentation, valuation and taxation of unit linked business: i Under UK GAAP assets held to cover unit linked liabilities are disclosed as a single line item, whereas under IFRS they are disclosed under the relevant investment and other balance sheet categories.
This reclassification has no impact on profit after tax or shareholders equity.
ii Under IFRS the Groups investments are classified as fair value through profit or loss and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement requires that the fair value for listed investment be determined at a bid value, rather than at mid value as under UK GAAP.
This revaluation from mid to bid for the assets held within the unit linked funds is offset by a change in investment contract liability benefits and thus has no impact on profit after tax or shareholders equity.
100 206697 Report & Accounts Back 20 3 06 7:46 pm Page 101 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued iii Under IFRS the Group is required to account for the movement in the deferred tax on unrealised capital gains provided within the unit linked funds as a tax charge or credit rather than being offset against the unrealised capital gains within investment return.
Adjustment has therefore been made to gross up the 17.8 million movement in deferred tax for the year ended 31 December 2004.
This has increased profit before tax by 17.8 million, but profit after tax and shareholders equity are unaffected.
iv Under UK GAAP Group discounted the deferred tax on unrealised capital gains provided within the unitlinked funds to reflect the expected time period over which the gains are expected to be realised.
While this discounting is required in determining the unit linked liability, IFRS does not permit the discounting of deferred tax in the computation of unit linked assets resulting in an asset liability mismatch.
Additional adjustments have therefore been made to account for the unprovided tax liability within the unit linked assets.
This has reduced profit after tax by 0.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2004 and shareholders equity by 0.5 million at 31 December 2004 nil at 1 January 2004.
Any tax liability will be settled by the unit linked funds rather than the Group.
e Consolidation of Unit Trusts IFRS requires the consolidation of certain St. Jamess Place Unit Trusts in which the Group, via its unit linked funds, owns more than half of the units.
These did not previously require consolidation under UK GAAP, but a different definition of the circumstances in which an entity is deemed to be under the control of an investor applies under IFRS.
The consolidation of these unit trusts has no impact on profit after tax or shareholders equity.
f Other Adjustments Impact on Shareholders Equity There are a number of other adjustments which affect profit after tax and shareholders equity, as set out below: i Dividend Recognition Under previous UK GAAP dividends were recognised in the period to which they related regardless of whether they had been declared or approved.
Under IAS 10 Events After the Balance Sheet Date dividends may only be recognised when they have been declared and approved.
The IFRS dividend for the year ended 31 December 2004 therefore represents the final 2003 dividend and the interim 2004 dividend.
The reversal of the final 2004 dividend has resulted in an increase in shareholders equity of 7.0 million at 31 December 2004 1 January 2004 6.5 million.
ii Share-Based Payment Under UK GAAP the costs of awards to employees and members of the St. Jamess Place Partnership under share-based payment plans, other than Save As You Earn Plans, were recognised immediately if no performance criteria applied.
Where performance criteria applied, the cost was recognised over the period to which the performance criteria related.
In both circumstances the cost of awards was based on the underlying share price at the date of grant of the awards, less any expected contribution.
The cost was based on a reasonable expectation of the extent to which performance criteria would be met and any subsequent changes in that expectation were reflected in the income statement.
Under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 which remain unvested at 1 January 2005 are measured at fair value.
The fair value of the equity instrument is determined at grant date and recognised over the vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment in equity.
In addition, a deferred tax asset, representing the expected future tax deduction in respect of instruments granted and based on intrinsic value, is also recognised.
The effect of this change in accounting treatment is to decrease profit after tax by 1.1 million in the year ended 31 December 2004.
However due to adjustments in equity, shareholders equity increased by 1.7 million at 31 December 2004 1.0 million at 1 January 2004.
101 206697 Report & Accounts Back 20 3 06 7:46 pm Page 102 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued iii Revaluation of Owner Occupied Property The Group has elected to value owner occupied property at the date of transition to IFRS 1 January 2004 and apply this fair value as the deemed cost at that date.
Revaluation adjustments made in the year ended 31 December 2004 have therefore been reversed, decreasing profit after tax for the year by 0.2 million.
Similarly, shareholders equity has decreased by 0.2 million at 31 December 2004 nil at 1 January 2004. g Other Adjustments Nil Impact on Shareholders Equity IFRS also require a number of gross up adjustments and balance sheet reclassifications, none of which affect profit after tax or shareholders equity.
Further details are shown below: i Policyholder and Shareholder Tax The Group discloses policyholders and shareholders tax separately within the income statement.
For the purposes of mapping the UK GAAP accounts under the IFRS format the tax on the long-term business fund was treated as policyholder tax.
Under IFRS, however, the Group is treating the tax paid by the unit linked funds to relevant tax authorities as policyholder tax, with all other tax being treated as shareholder tax.
This has resulted in the reclassification of certain non unit linked tax items out of policyholder tax into shareholder tax.
The overall impact of the adjustment is to increase policyholder tax by 12.6 million and decrease shareholder tax by 12.6 million in the year ended 31 December 2004.
There is no impact on the balance sheet as a result of these adjustments.
ii Acquired value of in-force business Under UK GAAP the acquired value of in-force business was disclosed net of tax.
The asset has been grossed up for deferred tax under IFRS, both increasing the acquired value of in-force business and the deferred tax liability by 21.0 million at 31 December 2004 21.8 million at 1 January 2004.
This adjustment has also given rise to an increase of 0.8 million in the cost of amortisation and a similar decrease in the tax expense in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004. iii Income Expense Gross Up Within the primary statements of the UK GAAP accounts the expenses of the unit trust business and other operations were netted off against their respective income streams.
These expenses, which totalled 56.4 million in the year ended 31 December 2004, have been grossed up under IFRS.
There is no balance sheet impact as a result of this adjustment.
iv Deferred Tax Gross Up The 7.3 million deferred tax asset nil at 1 January 2004 in respect of unrelieved expenses, which had previously been netted off against deferred tax liability under UK GAAP, has been grossed up under IFRS for presentational purposes.
There is no impact on the income statement.
v Reclassification Adjustment Monies held for the longer term in unitised money market funds 76.1 million at 31 December 2004, 25.4 million at 1 January 2004 have been reclassified as investment in collective investment schemes.
This adjustment has no impact on the income statement.
h Cash Flow Statement Under IFRS the Groups consolidated cash flow statement includes all cash flows of the Group, including those relating to the long-term fund.
Under UK GAAP the cash flows of the long-term fund are explicitly excluded, except to the extent that funds are transferred to or from the shareholder.
The inclusion of cash and cash equivalents held within the unit linked funds as referred to in note 35 para d i and the unit trusts subject to consolidation as disclosed within note 35 para e, offset by the reclassification of monies held for the longer term in unitised money market funds as set out in note 35 para g v, has increased the overall amount disclosed under cash and cash equivalents by 737.4 million as at 31 December 2004 838.1 million at January 2004.
