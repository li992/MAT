annual report 2005 notes to the financial statements.
1 Accounting policies a Basis of presentation The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, consistent with prior years, and comply with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
Where changes in policy or presentation are made, comparative figures are adjusted accordingly.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Shanks Group plc and all its subsidiary undertakings subsidiaries together with its share of the results of joint ventures.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or sold during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements up to, or from, the date control passes.
Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition accounting basis.
Wholly owned subsidiary companies set up under Private Finance Initiative PFI contracts are fully consolidated by the Group.
However, in view of the specific arrangement issues arising under PFI contracts, the Group has provided additional information concerning the financing of PFI companies to improve understanding by readers of these financial statements.
c Joint ventures The Group's share of joint ventures results is included in the consolidated profit and loss account.
The Group's share of gross assets and liabilities is shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
d Turnover Turnover represents the invoiced value of waste streams processed and other services provided including landfill tax but excluding sales taxes.
Turnover is recognised when processing occurs or the service is provided.
e Retirement benefits The cost of providing retirement pensions and related benefits is charged to the profit and loss account over the expected working lives of the pension scheme members currently in service.
For defined benefit schemes, any differences between the actuarial valuation of the schemes and the value of the assets in the schemes are also charged or credited to the profit and loss account over the expected working lives of the scheme members.
Differences between the amount charged in the profit and loss account and payments to the defined benefit schemes are treated as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet.
For defined contribution pension arrangements, amounts paid are charged to the profit and loss account in the year to which they relate.
The Group continues to apply SSAP 24 Pension Costs and has adopted the transitional arrangements permitted by FRS 17 - Retirement Benefits.
The disclosures required under FRS 17 are detailed in note 12 to the financial statements.
f Exceptional items Exceptional items are those items that need to be disclosed because of their size or incidence.
Normally these items are included in operating profit unless they are material and represent profits or losses on the sale or closure of an operation, costs of a fundamental reorganisation or restructuring, or profits and losses on the disposal of fixed assets.
In these cases the items are shown separately in the profit and loss account after operating profit.
continued 1 Accounting policies continued g Goodwill Goodwill arises when the cost of acquiring subsidiaries and businesses exceeds the fair value attributed to the net assets acquired.
Capitalised goodwill is written off over its useful life in accordance with FRS 10 Intangible Fixed Assets.
For goodwill arising in respect of businesses operating under long term PFI contracts the goodwill is written off over the term of the contract, which may exceed 20 years.
The carrying value of any such goodwill is reviewed annually.
The profit or loss on disposal or closure of a business is calculated after taking into account any related goodwill including amounts previously written off to reserves prior to the adoption of FRS 10. h Fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation, except for freehold land which is not depreciated, and less any write down for impairment.
i Buildings, plant and equipment: Depreciation is provided on these assets to write off their cost by equal annual instalments over the expected useful economic lives.
The expected useful life of buildings is 25 to 50 years.
Plant and equipment lives are: Computer equipment 1 to 3 years Mobile plant 5 years Generation equipment 8 to 15 years Heavy goods vehicles 8 to 10 years Other items 3 to 20 years ii Landfill sites: Acquisition costs, commissioning costs, engineering works and the discounted cost of final site restoration are capitalised.
These costs are written off over the operational life of each site based on the amount of void space consumed.
iii Capitalisation of finance costs: Finance costs directly attributable to separately identifiable major capital growth projects have been capitalised as part of the asset cost during the period of construction.
i Leased assets i Finance leases: Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
Leased assets are included in tangible fixed assets at the total of the capital elements of the payments during the lease term and the corresponding obligation is included in creditors.
Depreciation is provided to write off the assets over the shorter of the lease term or expected useful life.
ii Operating leases: All leases other than finance leases are treated as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in the year to which they relate.
The obligation to pay future rentals on operating leases is shown in note 27 to the financial statements.
annual report 2005 1 Accounting policies continued j Government grants and subsidies Capital related government grants are released to profit evenly over the expected useful lives of the assets to which they relate.
Revenue grants and subsidies are credited in the same period as the items to which they relate.
k Unprocessed waste The accrual for the cost of treating unprocessed waste is calculated at the higher of sales value and processing cost.
l Site restoration provision Full provision is made for the net present value NPV of the Group's unavoidable costs in relation to restoration liabilities at its landfill sites and this value is capitalised as a fixed asset.
In addition the Group continues to provide for the NPV of intermediate restoration costs over the life of its landfill sites, based on the quantity of waste deposited in the year.
m Aftercare provision Provision is made for the NPV of post closure costs based on the quantity of waste deposited in the year.
Similar costs incurred during the operating life of the sites are written off directly to the profit and loss account and not charged to the provision.
n Discounting All long term provisions for restoration, aftercare and onerous leases are calculated based on the NPV of estimated future costs.
The effects of inflation and unwinding of the discount element on existing provisions are reflected within the financial statements as a finance charge.
The real discount factor currently applied is 2%.
o Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full in respect of timing differences arising between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax assets in respect of trading tax losses are only recognised where the tax losses are expected to be recovered.
Deferred tax provisions have not been discounted.
p Foreign currencies Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, including capitalised goodwill and goodwill written off to reserves, are translated into sterling at the year end exchange rate.
Transactions and the results of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures in foreign currencies are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Exchange rate gains or losses arising on translation are offset by the translation gain or loss on currency borrowings with the net gain or loss reflected in reserves.
q Financial instruments The disclosures required by FRS 13 Financial Instruments are shown in note 19 to the financial statements.
The Group does not include short term debtors and creditors in these disclosures as permitted by FRS 13.

11 Pensions current SSAP 24 basis The Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
Under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, transitional disclosures are required as set out in note 12. a United Kingdom The Group's principal pension scheme is the Shanks Group Pension Scheme the Scheme which covers eligible United Kingdom employees and has both funded defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
Pension costs are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
The Group pension cost for the year for United Kingdom pensions was 2.5m 2004: 5.1m.
The reduction was principally due to the increased level of employee contributions from 1 May 2004 and the disposal of the UK landfill and power operations on 1 July 2004.
The most recent actuarial valuation at 5 April 2003 showed that the market value of the Scheme's assets was 42m.
The actuarial deficit on a smoothed funding basis was 12m and the Group plans to eliminate this deficit over the period 2005 to 2017.
For SSAP 24 purposes, the actuarial value of the Schemes assets represented 84% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The SSAP 24 deficit is being spread over the average remaining life of the current employees.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and to the rate of increase in salaries.
For SSAP24 purposes, it was assumed that the investment returns would be 1.6% per annum higher than the growth in pensionable pay for post-retirement returns and 2.6% per annum higher for pre-retirement returns.
It was further assumed that pensions in payment would increase at 2.6% per annum.
b Overseas In the Netherlands, employees are members of a compulsory transport industry wide defined benefit pension scheme.
It is not possible to separately identify the Groups share of the assets and liabilities of that scheme and the scheme is treated as a defined contribution pension scheme.
Senior employees in the Netherlands earning in excess of the maximum level of pay allowed for within the compulsory scheme also participate in a defined contribution arrangement for the excess amount.
In Belgium, the Group operates a small defined contribution scheme.
The total cost in the year for overseas pensions was 3.7m 2004: 3.5m.
annual report 2005 12 Pensions FRS 17 basis a United Kingdom Assumptions The most recent actuarial valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes operated by the Group have been updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of these schemes at 31 March 2005.
The main assumptions for FRS 17 purposes for the schemes were as follows: 2005 2004 % pa % pa Discount rate 5.4 5.5 Future salary growth 4.4 4.4 Rate of increase in pensions payment 2.8 2.8 to 2.9 Rate of price inflation 2.9 2.9 The assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions.
Profit and loss account 2005 2004 m m m m Operating profit: Current service cost 2.4 3.9 Curtailment gain 1.0 1.4 3.9 Other finance items: Interest on scheme liabilities 4.5 4.0 Expected return on scheme assets 3.9 3.1 0.6 0.9 Net pension cost before tax 2.0 4.8 The schemes are all closed to new members and consequently the current service cost as a percentage of pensionable payroll is expected to increase in future years.

The employer contribution rate agreed for 2005 6 is 19.3% of pensionable salary.
It is not possible to separately identify the Group's share of the assets and liabilities of that scheme and, as permitted by FRS 17, the scheme is treated as a defined contribution pension scheme.
