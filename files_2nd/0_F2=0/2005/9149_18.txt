Overview of the years activities Kingfisher is an international business, focused exclusively on home improvement in markets that fit strategic criteria of attractive scale, structure and economics.
The main retail brands: B&Q, Castorama and Brico Dpt, operate in nine countries across Europe and Asia, with entry into Russia and South Korea planned for 2005 06.
Kingfisher companies are market leaders in five countries, giving the Group an excellent platform for growth in all of its markets.
Dividends The Directors recommend a final dividend of 6.8p per ordinary share, amounting to 159.7 million to be paid on 3 June 2005 to shareholders on the register on 1 April 2005, making a total for the year of 10.65p per ordinary share.
A scrip dividend alternative was offered to shareholders in respect of the interim dividend but will be replaced, in respect of the final dividend, by a dividend reinvestment plan DRIP available to all shareholders who would prefer to invest their dividends in the shares of the Company.
A letter and explanatory leaflet explaining the DRIP has been sent to shareholders separately.
Directors Details of the current members of the Board are shown on pages 18 and 19.
The Directors submitting themselves for election or re-election at the Annual General Meeting on 27 May 2005 are Gerry Murphy Group Chief Executive, John Nelson Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director and Phil Bentley Chairman of the Audit Committee and independent Non-Executive Director.

During the year ended 29 January 2005, it became fully compliant with the requirements of the Combined Code published in July 2003, apart from the Chairman not formally holding meetings with the Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors present.
The Board considers that, with the evaluation process described in more detail below and with the Chairman conducting individual personal assessments of Directors contributions to the operation of the Board, there are sufficient opportunities without the presence of management for the Non-Executive Directors to raise any concerns.
The Board has completed the fourth independent evaluation of its performance and, for the first time, separate evaluations of the performance of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
These were conducted by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators.
These evaluations consider the operation of the Board and each committee in practice, including their corporate governance and the operation and content of their meetings.
If any corporate governance issues are identified, processes are reviewed with a view to improving their effectiveness and appropriate action taken.
The Company has an Audit Committee, a Nomination Committee, Remuneration Committee, Social Responsibility Committee and Finance Committee.
The Audit Committee provides an independent oversight of the effectiveness of the Groups internal control systems and financial reporting processes.
In addition, there are other internal control processes which enable the directors to confirm that they have reviewed the effectiveness of this system of internal control, and that it accords with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on internal control.

The Committee also oversees the administration of the Groups employee share schemes.
Remuneration policy for directors The Committee intends that Executive Director remuneration, both in terms of base salary and total remuneration, should be competitive by reference to the experience of the executive concerned, the role fulfilled and the markets in which the Company competes.
This is designed to promote business success through the recruitment, retention and motivation of the highest quality executives.
This policy is consistently applied across the Group for the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior managers.
The fees of the Chairman are set by reference to his time commitment and relevant benchmark data.
The Board determines the fees paid to Non-Executive Directors under a policy which seeks to recognise the time commitment, responsibility and technical skills required to make a valuable contribution to an effective board.
Annual bonus and long-term incentives for Executive Directors In 2003, the shareholders supported the adoption of the Kingfisher Incentive Scheme KIS comprising the Kingfisher Annual Cash Incentive Scheme 2003 KIS Cash scheme and the Kingfisher Incentive Share Scheme 2003 KIS Shares scheme through their approval of the KIS Shares scheme.
Under these arrangements, all senior executives receive a performance-related cash bonus under the KIS Cash scheme.
This is matched by a contingent share award under the KIS Shares scheme equal in value at the time of award to the cash bonus.
The contingent share award must be held for three years before it vests, with the shares being subject to forfeiture should the executive leave the Group during the three-year deferral period as a result of voluntary resignation or dismissal for cause.
The number of shares conditionally awarded may be increased by up to 40% multiplier award depending on the relative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance of the Company against the constituents of the FTSE 100 over the three year period following the year for which the bonus was earned.
At above median performance, 10% of these shares will vest, increasing on a straight line basis to 40% at above upper quartile performance.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee must also be satisfied that the TSR performance is reflective of underlying performance for such awards to vest.
TSR was selected as the most appropriate measure for the multiplier award as it is robust, aligns executives interests with those of shareholders and is generally favoured by the Companys leading UK institutional shareholders.
Substantial awards under the KIS Cash scheme and the KIS Shares scheme are only payable to executives on achievement of demanding performance targets as agreed with the Committee at the beginning of each year, based on the Groups strategic and financial planning process.
Assuming target performance is fully achieved, each component is valued at 60% of base salary for Executive Directors, giving a combined value equivalent to 120% of salary.
In years when the Company achieves performance significantly in excess of target up to a maximum of 82.5% of base salary in each of cash and contingent shares can be awarded before any impact of the TSR multiples.
The Committee has discretion to adjust awards up or down where it concludes that a particular individuals contribution warrants a different level of award but subject to the maximum combined level of 165% of base salary.
As, in certain respects, the performance achieved was below the targets set for the year, bonus payments fell below on-target levels to between 67.0% and 78.1% of salary, including the value of the KIS Shares award 2004: 150.5% to 154.9%.
For all Executive Directors at least 25% of their bonus opportunity is based on Group targets.

To receive further shares under the application of the TSR multiplier the TSR over the three year period following the year for which the bonus was earned must be above the median for the comparator group FTSE 100 index.
Further details of the TSR multiplier are described earlier.
2 Unlike the other Executive Directors, Gerry Murphy did not receive the normal and final grant of options in April 2003.
Consequently his contingent share award made under the KIS in April 2004 is subject to the TSR multiplier, details of which are described earlier.
3 As the awards are structured as nominal cost options on payment of 1 they can be exercised within a period of six months starting from the vesting date.
The value of the shares is the value of the award disclosed last year and made in April 2004 but earned in respect of the year ended 31 January 2004.
This was the first award made under the KIS Shares scheme.
The contingent shares will normally vest in April 2007.
A further award under the KIS Shares scheme to the value of 335,187, 113,866 and 128,865 to each of Gerry Murphy, Ian Cheshire and Duncan Tatton-Brown, respectively, will be made at the average mid market price of shares in Kingfisher over the period 1 April to 5 April 2005.
Such contingent shares would normally then vest in April 2008.
Pension provision Bill Whiting retires on 31 March 2005 at age 57 with an entitlement to an annual pension, which will be actuarially reduced to reflect his retiring three years early.
All of the other Executive Directors are members to the level of the Earnings Cap, 102,000 as at 29 January 2005 of the Companys approved funded pension arrangement which has been available to all UK employees who joined the Group prior to 1 April 2004 and supplements to salary above the Earnings Cap are paid totalling 342,095, including a contribution to Gerry Murphys FURBS.
All three continuing Executive Directors are only in the Groups final salary pension scheme up to the limit of the Earnings Cap.
This limit is set to fall away in April 2006 as a result of announced tax changes but, to avoid escalation of costs, the Company intends to introduce a scheme Earnings Cap broadly in line with the Government set Earnings Cap.
The Company also intends to review the provision of FURBS in the light of the impending changes to pension provision required by the Finance Act 2004.
There is no intention to increase the Companys costs as a result of this review or the introduction of the scheme Earnings Cap.
Option schemes Apart from the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme SAYE an all-employee share incentive plan, all other option and incentive arrangements have been discontinued but awards made in previous years will vest over time, in accordance with the rules governing the various plans.
Following his retirement, the outstanding executive options granted to Bill Whiting will become exercisable within 42 months of their grant date or 12 months from the date of his retirement, whichever is the later.
In respect of the outstanding SAYE options, Bill Whiting will be entitled to continue to save the monthly amount for a further six months after retirement, after which he can either exercise options over the number of shares to which his then level of savings entitles him, or continue to save under the savings contract and lose the right to the options.
Apart from Bill Whiting and Duncan Tatton-Brown, who exercised 1,109 and 5,553 options respectively at 171.04p per share under the SAYE plan which vested in December 2004, resulting in gains of 1,557.70 and 7,188.91 respectively, no gains on options have been made, as no others have been exercised in the year.

In accordance with the terms of his appointment, the value of the award was 360,000 as of the date of his appointment and the number of shares awarded was based on the Companys share price of 192.5p on that date 3 February 2003.
2 Awards were granted on 17 April 2003 when the share price was 239.17p pre the seven for eight consolidation in July 2003 equivalent to 273.34p per share post consolidation.
The number of shares shown in the table are the number of shares awarded on a post consolidation basis.
3 No matching shares vest for below median performance.
490,908 is the maximum number of matching shares which may vest for upper quartile TSR performance over the three-year performance period reducing to one-third for median performance.
4 If Gerry Murphys employment terminates before any vesting date by reason of death, injury, ill health, early termination by Kingfisher other than for cause or resignation for good reason as defined in his service contract, then the investment shares will vest at that date and, subject to the discretion of the Committee in certain limited circumstances, such of the matching shares as can be treated as vested, taking into account TSR performance up to the date of cessation of his employment, but reduced on a time pro-rated basis.
5 Following an investment of 275,000 in the shares of the Company by Gerry Murphy, up to a further 285,960 matching shares, which vest for upper quartile TSR performance over the three-year performance period reducing to one-third 95,320 for median performance, were awarded on 28 April 2004 at a price of 288.5p.
6 As the awards are structured as nominal cost options on payment of 1 they can be exercised within a six month period starting from the vesting date.
Closed incentive plans There are three further long-term incentive plans, the Executive Share Option Scheme, the Incentive Growth Plan IGP and the Kingfisher Incentive Plan KIP, which are now closed and under which no further awards will be made but where there are amounts from prior awards which may still become exercisable or due at the end of their respective vesting periods, performance cycles or deferral periods.
Any such amounts will vest or be paid, before the plans are wound up.
The full details of each can be found in previous Annual Reports.
Details of the outstanding awards are in the full Remuneration Report in the Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 and can be obtained at www.
Service contracts All Executive Directors have service contracts: which are terminable by no more than 12 months notice by either side, with no different arrangements in the event of a change of control: and that provide for termination payments to be paid on a phased monthly basis for a maximum of 12 months, reduced if the Director starts lower paid employment during the 12 month period and payments cease immediately when employment providing the same or higher value remuneration is started.
Shareholder return The Companys Total Shareholder Return share price growth plus dividends paid for the five years to 29 January 2005 is shown in the graph below, which shows the value, at the end of the 2004 05 financial year, of 100 invested in Kingfisher over the last five financial years, assuming shares awarded in Woolworths and Kesa Electricals, when demerged, were sold and the proceeds re-invested in Kingfisher shares, compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE 100 Index.
The other points are plotted at the values at intervening financial year ends.
The Company chose the FTSE 100 Index as an appropriate comparator because the Company has been a constituent of that index throughout the period and its constituents are used as the comparator group under the KIS Shares scheme.

Adjusted earnings per share, which removes the impact of exceptional items and acquisition goodwill amortisation, increased 16.9% from 17.8p to 20.8p per share.

Kingfisher will replace the scrip dividend alternative with the option to have the payment of this dividend made via a dividend reinvestment plan DRIP.
This is available to all shareholders who would prefer to invest their dividends in the shares of the Company.
Further details of the DRIP are being circulated separately to all shareholders with the Annual Report and Notice of Annual General Meeting.
The final dividend of 6.8p per share for the year ended 29 January 2005 will be paid on 3 June 2005 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 1 April 2005, subject to approval of shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting, to be held on 27 May 2005.
Return on invested capital Underlying return on invested capital ROIC improved in the year from 8.7% to 8.9%.
Underlying ROIC assumes properties appreciate in value at a steady rate over the long-term.
When calculating the underlying ROIC, short-term variations in property values more or less than the long-term mean are excluded.
ROIC is defined as net operating profit less adjusted taxes operating profit excluding goodwill amortisation, exceptionals, property lease and depreciation costs less tax at the Groups effective tax rate, plus property revaluation in the year divided by average invested capital average holding in the year of fixed and net current assets invested in the business, plus property operating lease costs capitalised at the market property yield.
Cash flow and investment in the businesses Net debt decreased from 843.8 million at the start of the year to 794.3 million at the year end.
A total of 689.5 million of net cash was generated from operating activities compared to 777.4 million in the previous year which included the cash flows of Kesa Electricals for the first five months of the year.
Working capital increased during the year, driven by a higher level of stock held reflecting growth in the number of stores, an increase in the level of fulfilment capacity and increasing the level of stock in January in anticipation of the earlier Easter in 2005.
Capital expenditure for the Group was 407.4 million, up from 389.1 million in the previous year.
A total of 20.5 million 2004: 819.2 million was received during the year in respect of the sale of tangible fixed assets.
The prior year receipts included the proceeds of the disposal of the Chartwell Land property portfolio.
Financing In November 2004, a committed bank facility for 180 million was cancelled as it was no longer required.
At 29 January 2005, Kingfisher had a 540 million committed bank facility, maturing in February 2007.
Since the year end, the Group has refinanced this facility, replacing it with a new committed bank revolving credit facility totalling 500 million, provided by a number of banks.
This facility provides committed funding on improved terms, and in addition has extended the maturity to August 2010.
The facility is available to be drawn to support general corporate purposes.
Investments, acquisitions and disposals There were no material acquisitions or disposals during the year.
Property Property income primarily rent charged to B&Q on UK properties owned by Kingfisher grew 28.2% to 41.4 million 2004: 32.3 million reflecting rental inflation and some additional properties.
Kingfisher owns a significant property portfolio, substantially all of which is now used for trading purposes and which, at the year end, had a value of 2.4 billion.
Kingfisher has continued its normal practice of externally valuing on an existing use basis one-third of the property portfolio on a rolling basis, with internal valuations being performed for the other two-thirds.
In both cases, these revalued amounts have been incorporated into the accounts, giving rise to a revaluation surplus in the year of 175.8 million.
Kingfisher plc Annual Review 2004 05 24 0151 Kingfisher Review p20 26 6 4 05 7:11 am Page 25 Other operating costs Other operating costs principally Group central costs fell 21.9% to 36.1 million 2004: 46.2 million following last years reorganisation of the corporate offices in London and Lille.
Interest The net interest charge from continuing operations for the year was 25.3 million, down 8.3 million from the prior year.
The current year interest charge has benefited primarily from a lower average net debt during the year.
Exceptional items Exceptional items include a charge of 17.7 million which has been incurred in respect of the outstanding unsecured working capital loan made in connection with the disposal of ProMarkt.
The loan was due to be repaid in January 2005, however, due to difficult trading conditions experienced by ProMarkt, they were unable to repay the loan in full by that date.
The term of the loan has been extended, however, given the uncertainty surrounding its recoverability, the remaining balance of the loan was fully provided against in the current year.
Taxation The effective overall tax rate on profit has decreased from 46.3% in the prior year to 30.0%.
The high rate in the prior year was due to exceptional items charged not qualifying for tax relief.
The effective tax rate on profit for continuing operations before exceptional items and acquisition goodwill excluding prior year tax adjustments is 31.6%, consistent with the prior year.
Pensions Kingfisher continues to account for pension costs on the basis of the requirements of SSAP 24 and provides the disclosures regarding the FRS 17 valuation of Kingfishers UK defined benefit pension scheme the Scheme net assets and liabilities.
At the start of the year, the FRS 17 valuation for the Scheme showed a deficit, net of deferred tax, of 189 million.
The Kesa Electricals section of the Scheme was transferred to a new Kesa Pension Scheme during the year resulting in a reduction in the deficit, net of deferred tax, of 44 million.
However, this reduction was more than offset by the impact of lower assumed corporate bond rates and changes in financial and demographic assumptions.
The revised deficit, net of deferred tax was 209 million at 29 January 2005.
Kingfisher, in consultation with the Trustees, has decided to make additional contributions to the Scheme over and above the normal annual contributions totalling 250 million over the next three years.
The additional funds will be invested by the Scheme in assets designed to match its expected liability profile.
The funding will reduce Kingfishers exposure to future funding risks while increasing pension scheme solvency.
The initial financial impact of these additional contributions will be to reduce Kingfishers pension deficit and replace it with debt.
Accounting changes There have been no new accounting standards adopted during the year ended 29 January 2005. International Financial Reporting Standards Kingfisher will adopt International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for the financial year ending 28 January 2006 and, as a result, has restated under IFRS the financial information for the year ended 29 January 2005 which will form the comparatives for next years consolidated financial statements.
Kingfisher has elected to defer the application of the financial instrument standards IAS 32 and IAS 39 until the financial year ending 28 January 2006 and therefore there is no impact from the standards on the restated 2004 05 IFRS financial statements.
For the year ended 29 January 2005 the impact on profits from the adoption of IFRS would be to reduce retail profit by less than 1% and profit after tax by 3%, with an underlying reduction in profit after tax of 5% excluding a functional currency benefit under IAS 21.
Net assets would be reduced by 7% at 1 February 2004 and by 11% at 21 January 2005 after the reversal of the property revaluation uplift recorded under UK GAAP.
A separate announcement detailing the impacts of IFRS and providing restated primary statements was made on 17 March 2005.

Only the continuing element of the former e-commerce sector and property sector has been included.
The loss recorded in 2004 05 in respect of the ProMarkt electrical business has also been excluded to assist comparability.
The Group has undergone a significant amount of restructuring including the demerger of Woolworths and the sale of Superdrug in 2001 02, the buy-out of the Castorama minority in 2002 03 and the demerger of Kesa Electricals in 2003 04.
