Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30.
Financial instruments The group purchases or issues financial instruments in order to finance its operations and to manage the interest rate and currency risks that arise from those operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial balances, for example trade debtors, trade creditors, accruals and prepayments, arise directly from the groups operations.
The group nances its operations through a mixture of retained reserves, bank revolving credit borrowings, long-term bank loans and corporate bonds.
In respect of its South African businesses, the group manages overnight cash ows centrally through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sabn Pty Ltd. Project finance and term borrowings are negotiated directly with the banking industry by South African group operating subsidiaries, but subject to internal group treasury policies.
Outside South Africa, the groups treasury is managed by SABMiller Finance BV which is responsible for both the central cash and the central borrowing portfolio, and foreign exchange management for the transfer of dividends and various cash ows from group operating subsidiaries to central treasury.
Operating subsidiaries negotiate facilities directly with banks in their various operating regions to meet relatively short-term local funding requirements but under central treasury guidance and policies.
The group also enters into derivatives transactions, principally forward foreign currency contracts, forward rate agreements and interest rate swaps in order to manage the currency and interest rate risk arising from the groups operations.
The group does not write interest rate or currency options and currency options are only purchased as a cost-effective alternative to forward foreign exchange contracts.
It is group policy that no trading in financial instruments be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
Compliance with the groups policies and exposure limits is reviewed periodically by the board of directors.
These policies have remained unchanged throughout the year ended 31 March 2005.
Interest rate risk The group nances its operations through a mixture of retained reserves, bank and corporate bond borrowings.
The group borrows principally in rand, euro, Polish zloty, Czech krone and in US dollars at both xed and oating rates of interest.
The interest rate characteristics of new borrowings and the renancing of existing borrowings are positioned according to expected movements in interest rates.
In order to hedge specic exposures in the interest rate repricing prole of existing borrowings and anticipated peak additional borrowings the group makes use of interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to generate the desired interest prole and to manage the groups exposure to interest rate uctuations.
The groups policy is to maintain a level of xed rate borrowings measured on a rolling basis intended to limit the impact of a 1% change in interest rates to 1% of group operating profit excluding exceptional items.
As at 31 March 2005 52% 2004: 68% of the groups borrowings were at xed rates after taking into account interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
The changes in the xed rate percentage between the two years is analysed further in this note under the interest rate risk prole of financial liabilities and financial assets.
Liquidity risk In order to mitigate any liquidity risk that the group may face, the groups policy has been, throughout the year ended 31 March 2005, to maintain substantial unutilised banking facilities and reserve borrowings capacity, as indicated by the level of undrawn facilities.
Foreign currency risk The group seeks to mitigate the effect of structural currency exposures by borrowing, where cost effective, in the same currencies as the functional currencies of its main operating units.
It is not the groups policy to hedge foreign currency translation exposures.
The group also has transactional currency exposures which principally arise from sales or purchases, in currencies other than the units functional currency.
The groups policy is to limit the aggregate uncovered net transaction exposure to US$60 million 2004: US$60 million being intended to limit the impact on group operating profit to 1% for every 10% movement in exchange rates against the US dollar.
The actual position at 31 March 2005 was US$35 million 2004: US$10 million.
The following tables exclude short-term debtors and non-interest bearing short-term creditors except for the table on the fair values of financial assets and liabilities where these balances are included within book and fair values and the table of net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities.
Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk prole of financial liabilities and financial assets After taking into account the groups interest rate and currency swaps and forward rate agreements the currency and interest rate exposures of the borrowings of the group at 31 March 2005 were: Financial Floating liabilities rate Fixed rate where no financial financial interest is liabilities liabilities Total paid Currency US$m US$m US$m US$m SA rand 13 38 51 US dollars 660 2,316 2,976 6 Central European currencies 141 146 287 Euro 252 252 1 Other currencies 125 16 141 At 31 March 2004 1,191 2,516 3,707 7 SA rand 230 230 US dollars 701 1,592 2,293 3 Central European currencies 250 122 372 Euro 284 1 285 1 Other currencies 128 31 159 At 31 March 2005 1,593 1,746 3,339 4 Based on the above oating rate borrowings at 31 March 2005, a 1% change in interest rates would impact group operating profit, over a 12-month period, by approximately US$16 million, which is 0.9% of group operating profit.
The percentage of xed rate borrowings at 31 March 2005 was 52% 2004: 68%.
The interest rate swaps included in the table above decrease xed rate debt by US$600 million with a corresponding increase in oating rate debt.

Euro and US dollar oating rate borrowings are xed in advance for periods ranging from 30 to 180 days and are mainly priced by reference to Euribor LIBOR.
Central European borrowing rates vary signicantly between the various functional currency areas comprising this region, but are priced by reference to a combination of local market rates or LIBOR depending on the practice of the various markets.
Other currencies comprise various xed rate African currencies especially inuenced by relatively high interest rates in Angola, Mozambique and Botswana.

Financial instruments continued The group held the following financial assets, as part of the nancing arrangements of the group at 31 March 2005: 2005 2004 US$m US$m US dollar short-term deposits 676 18 Other short-term deposits 13 13 SA rand cash 146 236 US dollar cash 207 309 Other cash 101 106 1,143 682 The above financial assets are all priced at oating rates with interest rates reset and or maturity dates within one year.
Rand assets attract interest rates at overnight money market call rate, and US dollar assets attract LIBOR related interest rates at various margins.
Other currencies include those of Central European countries, Central America and the African continent.
Rand cash and short-term deposits are subject to South African exchange control regulations.
South Africas exchange control regulations provide for restrictions on exporting capital from South Africa, other than normal dividends.
Undrawn borrowing facilities The group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available to it: Expiring Expiring Expiring within between one in more than one year and two years two years Total US$m US$m US$m US$m Group Central Treasury 561 561 Africa and Asia 31 8 39 Europe 203 46 68 317 Americas 11 10 21 South Africa 576 576 At 31 March 2004 1,382 64 68 1,514 Group Central Treasury 832 832 Africa and Asia 72 72 Europe 278 18 296 Americas 16 15 31 South Africa 460 460 At 31 March 2005 826 18 847 1,691 As at 31 March 2005 the facilities expiring within one year are of a general banking nature and thus subject to review at various dates usually on an annual basis, and it is expected that this prole will continue relative to core working capital and seasonal peak borrowing requirements.
The facilities expiring beyond two years are of a project and structured finance nature, and are mostly utilised to finance capital expenditure as well as those of a general funding nature.
Currency exposures The group seeks to mitigate the effect of the currency exposures arising from its net investments by borrowing as far as possible in the same currencies as the operating currencies of its main operating units.
Gains and losses arising on net investments and the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The table below shows the extent to which group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currency.
The table below shows the groups transactional or non-structural currency exposures that could give rise to net currency gains and losses which are recognised in the profit and loss account.

Certain subsidiaries have open forward contracts to manage short-term foreign currency exposures to expected future trade imports and exports.
These activities are predominantly centred in South Africa and take place between the SA rand, US dollar, and the euro.
Based on the above net transaction exposure position at 31 March 2005, a simultaneous 10% change in all foreign exchange rates against divisional reporting currencies would impact group operating profit by approximately US$3.5 million, which is well within the policy limit of 1% of group operating profit.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table presents the carrying amounts and the fair values of the groups financial instruments as at 31 March 2005.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash ows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
The estimated net fair values have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies, as detailed below, but are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the group could realise in the normal course of business.

Financial instruments continued The following methods and assumptions were used by the group in determining fair values: Due to their short-term nature, liquid resources, trade debtors and trade creditors are shown at the book values reported in the balance sheet.
Borrowings the fair values of the groups xed rate loans are estimated using quoted prices or, where such prices are not available, discounted cash ows analysed using the appropriate yield curve.
The book values of oating rate borrowings approximate their fair value.
Forward instruments the fair values of interest rate derivatives are based on discounted cash ow analysis and comprise contracts with xing dates after 31 March 2005.
The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts are determined using the relevant market forward foreign exchange rates.
Hedging The groups policy is to hedge on a cost effective basis the following exposures: Interest rate risk using interest rate derivatives: Currency transaction risk using forward foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency creditors.
Forward foreign currency contracts are also used to hedge currency exposures on future expected transactions.
Under the groups accounting policy, foreign currency balances which are hedged using forward foreign currency contracts are translated at the forward rate inherent in the contracts.
Consequently, the relevant asset or liability effectively has the gain or loss on the hedging instrument embedded in its carrying value.
Such gains and losses are treated as deferred until the underlying position matures: and Commodity price risk commodity contracts are purchased from time to time to hedge the underlying price risks inherent in the aluminium component of can purchases.
