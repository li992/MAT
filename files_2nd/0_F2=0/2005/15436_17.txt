The fair value of the net assets acquired in the acquisition of Wilson Connolly Holdings Plc in 2003 was revised in 2004 from 369.0m to 362.1m.
This comprised of a reduction in the fair value of tangible assets by 1.5m, a reduction in the fair value of stocks by 5.1m and an increase in other provisions of 0.3m.

Contributions of 6.9m 2004: 3.1m were charged to income in respect of defined contribution schemes.
The Group also operates a number of overseas pension schemes of the defined benefit type.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the TWGP & LAF was carried out at 1 June 2004 and updated to 1 September 2004 to take account of subsequent mergers.
The TWNHSPS commenced in December 2003 and the Actuary has now completed his initial valuation with an effective date of 31 December 2003.
The projected unit method was used in all valuations and assets were taken into account using market values.
The main financial assumptions, which are all relative to the ination assumption, are as set out below: Assumptions TWGP&LAF TWNHSPS Inflation 2.5% pa 2.5% pa Investment return pre post retirement 5.0 3.0% pa 3.0 3.0% pa General pay inflation 0% pa 1.0% pa Pension increases 0% pa 0% pa Valuation results TWGP&LAF TWNHSPS Market value of assets 563.3m 0.05m Past service liabilities 627.9m 0.09m Scheme funding levels 90% 58% The actuaries to each scheme calculated the long-term funding rates to be 16.0% TWGP&LAF and 18%pa TWNHSPS of each schemes respective pensionable salary roll.
The funding policy of the Trustees is to maintain a stable contribution rate with a funding level in excess of 100%.
The valuations of the Groups pension schemes have been updated to 31 December 2005 and the position of overseas schemes has been included within the IAS 19 disclosures.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of the disclosure items are as follows: United Kingdom North America 2005 2004 2005 2004 As at 31 December Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.75% 5.3% 5.0-5.4% 5.9-6.0% Expected return on scheme assets 5.8% 5.8% 6.6% 5.7% General pay inflation 2.6% 2.5% 3.5-4.0% 4.0-4.5% Pension increases 2.6% 2.5% 0.0-3.0% 0.0-3.0% The above annual assumptions are prescribed by IAS 19 and do not reflect the assumptions that may be used in future funding valuations of the Groups pension schemes.
The key change in assumptions in the year relates to future bond yields.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

The gross post-retirement liability also includes 2.7m at 31 December 2005 2004: 3.8m in respect of continuing post-retirement health care insurance premiums for retired long service employees.
The liability is based upon the actuarial assessment of the remaining cost by a qualified actuary on a net present value basis at 31 December 2005.
The cost is calculated assuming a discount rate of 5% per annum and an increase in medical expenses of 12.2% per annum.
The premium cost to the Group in respect of retired long service employees for 2005 was 0.2m 2004: 0.2m.

As there is a temporary difference between the accounting and tax bases, a deferred tax asset is recorded.
The deferred tax asset arising is calculated by comparing the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future based on the company's share price at the balance sheet date with the cumulative amount of the expense recorded in the income statement.
If the amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory tax rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, in this share-based payment tax reserve.

Contingent liabilities The company and certain subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, given guarantees and entered into counterindemnities in respect of bonds relating to the Group's own contracts and given guarantees in respect of the Group's share of certain contractual obligations of joint ventures.
Provision is made for the Directors' best estimate of known legal claims and legal actions in progress.
The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on that advice, that the action is unlikely to succeed or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made.
Operating lease arrangements The Group as lessee At the balance sheet date, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2005 2004 m m Within one year 14.0 12.0 In more than one year but not more than five years 32.9 33.5 After five years 31.9 38.2 78.8 83.7 Operating lease payments principally represent rentals payable by the Group for certain office properties and vehicles.
The Group as lessor At the balance sheet date, the Group had contracted with tenants for the following future minimum lease payments: 2005 2004 m m Within one year 0.8 1.6 In more than one year but not more than five years 3.0 5.5 After five years 2.3 7.6 6.1 14.7 Operating lease receipts represent rental income in respect of certain office and commercial properties.

Share based payments continued The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 3.17 2004: 2.61.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2005 had a range of exercise prices from nil to 2.61 2004: nil to 2.5275 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.9 years 2004: 6.3 years.
For share options with non-market conditions granted during the current and preceding year the fair value of those options at grant date were determined using the Binomial model.
The inputs into that model were as follows: 2005 2004 Weighted average share price 3.11 2.15 Weighted average exercise price 0.68 0.68 Expected volatility 32.4% - 32.9% 32.4% - 33.6% Expected life 3 5 years 3 5 years Risk-free rate 4.33% - 4.36% 4.76% - 4.82% Expected dividend yield 3.6% - 3.8% 3.4% - 3.5% The weighed average fair value of share options granted during the year is 2.29 2004: 1.95.
For share options with market conditions granted during the current year the fair value of these options were determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model.
The inputs into that model were as follows: 2005 2004 Weighted average share price 3.19 - Weighted average exercise price nil - Expected volatility 26% - 30% - Expected life 3 years - Risk-free rate 4.2% - Expected dividend yield 3.6% - The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year is 1.75 2004: nil Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the expected term.
The expected life used in the model is based on historic exercise patterns.
The group recognised total expenses of 5.9m and 3.4m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2005 and 2004 respectively.
Related party transactions Transactions between the company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
Transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are disclosed below.
Transactions between the company and its subsidiaries and joint ventures are disclosed in the companys separate financial statements.
Trading transactions During the year, Group companies purchases from joint ventures totalled 7.3m 2004: 6.6m.
Purchases were based on open market values.

Explanation of transition to IFRS The disclosures concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS, namely the reconciliations of equity at 1 January 2004 and at 31 December 2004 and the reconciliations of profit and cash ow for 2004, were published on the Groups website, www.
These provide details of all adjustments on a line by line basis.
2004 2003 m m Reconciliation of equity Total equity as previously reported under UK GAAP at 31 December 1,638.8 1,577.0 Proposed dividend IAS 10 45.5 37.4 Goodwill not amortised IFRS 3 20.4 - Share-based payment tax reserve IAS 12 2.8 3.2 Asset valuation rules IAS 19 1.2 1.2 Financial instruments IAS 32 39 1.8 1.4 Discounting of land creditors IAS 32 39 4.3 2.9 Preference shares to debt IAS 32 39 - 101.1 Total equity as restated under IFRS at 31 December 1,703.8 1,513.8 2004 m Reconciliation of retained profit for 2004 Profit for the financial year as previously reported under UK GAAP 264.8 Goodwill not amortised IFRS 3 20.4 Translation realised IAS 21 1.4 Asset valuation rules IAS 19 0.1 Financial instruments IAS 32 39 0.7 Discounting of land creditors IAS 32 39 1.4 Preference shares to debt IAS 32 39 1.3 Retained profit for the year as restated under IFRS 280.3 IAS 10 Events After the Balance Sheet Date IAS 10 provides that any dividends declared after the year end represent a non-adjusting post balance sheet event and therefore no liability should be recognised.
In accordance with this provision Taylor Woodrow has decreased its current liabilities at the year end for dividends declared after the year end.
IFRS 3 Business combinations This standard requires goodwill to be carried at cost with impairment reviews carried out both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Under the transitional arrangements set out in IFRS 1 Taylor Woodrow has applied IFRS 3 prospectively from the transition date.
The net carrying value of goodwill as at 31 December 2003 has therefore been brought forward as cost at 1 January 2004 with no amortisation charge from this date.
IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates On the disposal of a foreign operation or part thereof, the cumulative amount of the exchange differences deferred in translation reserve relating to that foreign operation are now recognised in profit or loss when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.
Previously, exchange differences on share capital, revaluation reserve, pre-acquisition retained profit and loss account, inter-company long-term loans and foreign currency borrowings, to the extent they hedged the Groups investment in overseas operations, were taken to revaluation reserve and transferred directly to profit and loss account reserve on disposal: exchange differences on postacquisition profit and loss account were previously taken to and remained in profit and loss account reserve.
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005 81 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for year to 31 December 2005 36.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued IAS 12 Income Taxes IAS 12 requires separate disclosure of deferred tax asset from its associated pension deficit on the balance sheet.
The impact has therefore been to reclassify the deferred tax asset in respect of retirement benefit obligations that had previously been used to reduce this provision.
IAS 19 Employee Benets Dened benefit pension scheme assets are required to be valued at bid prices rather than mid-market prices.
IAS 32 & IAS 39 Financial Instruments IAS 39 requires derivative financial instruments to be disclosed separately at fair value, the movement of which is taken to profit or loss, and the loans related to them to be disclosed separately on the basis of their original currency at amortised cost.
Previously such loans were stated using the currency into which they had been swapped by the derivatives and the derivatives were not themselves included on the balance sheet.
In addition, land payables are now discounted and the discount amortised to finance costs over the period of liability.
In accordance with IAS 32, preference shares were reclassied and disclosed as financial liabilities.
Material adjustments to the cash ow statement for 2004 Cash ows under IFRS include those in respect of cash equivalents.
An adjustment was therefore made to include the cash ows in respect of cash held on deposit for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments.
Cash ows arising from taxes on income were reclassied as cash ows from operating activities, as it was not possible to identify elements associated with nancing and investing activities.
Cash ows arising from interest payments were reclassied as cash ows from operating activities on the basis that they enter into the determination of profit.
Under IAS 31 an entity must account for joint ventures using either proportional consolidation or equity method accounting.
The policy adopted is applied to all joint ventures.
Taylor Woodrow has chosen to adopt the policy of equity method accounting in respect of its joint ventures.
Under UK GAAP joint arrangements for certain housing and property developments were not considered entities and were proportionally consolidated.
An adjustment was therefore made to reverse the cash ows associated with joint ventures that were previously proportionally consolidated.
Standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following relevant Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures.
IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease.
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on financial instruments when the relevant standard comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
