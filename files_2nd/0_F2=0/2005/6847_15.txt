6 Pensions The group maintains a defined contribution scheme, which is open to all new employees, a Greene King defined benefit scheme which closed to new entrants on 2 May 1997 and a Morland defined benefit scheme for former Morland employees which was closed to new entrants on 12 December 2000.
During the year defined benefit pension obligations arising from Laurel employees have been incorporated into the Greene King defined benefit scheme.
Member funds for the defined contribution scheme are held and administered by the Prudential Assurance Company.
Member funds for the defined benefit schemes are held in separate funds independently of the group's finances and are administered by pension trustees.
Actuarial valuations of the defined benefit schemes were carried out by SBJ Benefit Consultants as at 5 April 2003 using the projected unit method.
As the scheme is now closed to new members the current service cost, under the projected unit credit valuation basis, will increase as a percentage of salary as members of the scheme approach retirement although the overall cost will decrease as the number of members decreases.
The principal assumptions were that retail price inflation would be 2.50% per annum, pension increases would be in line with price inflation, real salary growth would be 1.75% per annum and the real investment return would be 5.5% pre-retirement and 3.0% post-retirement per annum.
The total market value of the schemes' assets was 80.4 million, which represented 72% of the accrued members benefits.
This shortfall is being funded by contributions of 2.8 million per annum.
Contributions of 15.6% of pensionable salaries are being made in respect of current service.
For FRS 17 purposes, the most recent valuations have been updated to 1 May 2005, using the principal assumptions that price inflation would be 2.80% per annum 2004 - 2.90%, 2003 - 2.50%, pension increases would be 2.60% per annum 2004 - 2.70%, 2003 - 2.50%, real salary growth would be 2.0% per annum 2004 - 2.0%, 2003 - 1.75% and the discount rate would be 5.30% per annum 2004 - 5.70%, 2003 - 5.40%.

The exceptional adjustment in respect of prior years of 3.4 million is as a result of a favourable decision by the Special Commissioners.
Factors that may affect future tax charges Based on current capital investment plans, it is anticipated that capital allowance claims will be in excess of depreciation in future years.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property to its market value or on the sale of properties where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
Such tax would become payable only if the property were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
The total amount unprovided for is 146.9 million 2004 - 93.8 million.
At present it is not envisaged that any such tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.

Securitised debt On 7 March 2005, 600 million of bonds were issued in connection with the securitisation of 904 of the group's pubs held in Greene King Retailing Limited.
The bonds are secured over the properties and their future income streams and were issued by Greene King Finance plc, a company outside of the group.
The funds were on-lent to the group on similar terms and used to repay existing bank facilities.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Greene King Retailing Limited.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash to other group companies.

The fair value of cash and trade loans is not materially different from book value.
The fair value liability of the interest rate swaps included above was 21.2 million 2004 - 4.2 million.
The expected loss to be recognised in the profit and loss account in the following year was 2.9 million 2004 - 0.8 million.
The actual loss recognised in the profit and loss account during the year was 3.3 million 2004 - 3.7 million, and 13.5 million relating to early termination.
