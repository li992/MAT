ii Net interest arising on interest rate agreements is taken to the profit and loss account.
iii Premiums paid or received on currency options are taken to the profit and loss account when the option expires or matures.
iv Gains or losses arising on jet fuel swaps are taken to the profit and loss account in the same period as the underlying transaction.
If the underlying transaction to a hedge ceases to exist, the hedge is terminated and the profits and losses on termination are recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.
If the hedge transaction is terminated, the profits and losses on termination are held in the balance sheet and amortised over the life of the original underlying transactions.
