The differences are explained in the following reconciliation: 2005 2005 2004 2004 000s % 000s % Profit before tax 86,811 70,229 Tax at 30% thereon: 26,043 30.0% 21,069 30.0% Factors affecting the income tax expense for the year: Permanent items 2,885 3.3% 1,138 1.6% Losses not previously recognised in deferred tax 26 0.0% 156 0.2% Adjustments in respect of previous years 1,264 1.5% 2,418 3.4% Effect of overseas tax rates 1,031 1.2% 1,480 2.1% Total income tax expense for the year 28,669 33.0% 21,425 30.5% The Groups total tax charge is currently 31.0% of profit before tax and goodwill impairment losses non tax deductible 2004: 30.5%.
The following factors that will affect the Groups future total tax charge as a percentage of profits are: the mix of profits between UK and overseas companies.
With the exception of Ireland and Poland, all overseas trading companies attract a higher corporation tax rate than that suffered in the UK of 30%.
If the proportion of profits from overseas companies increases, this could result in a higher Group tax charge: and the adverse impact of permanent disallowables.
The Group has taken account of primarily all trading losses in its deferred tax balance.
Although tax losses can be used to reduce cash payments of tax, utilisation of such losses would result in a deferred tax charge in that year which would eliminate any profit and loss benefit.

Details of each of the schemes are provided below: a Save As You Earn SAYE Scheme The Company operates a SAYE scheme within the UK which is open to all UK employees and is linked to a monthly savings contract over three and five-year periods.
Options have been granted to scheme participants at 80% of the prevailing market price.
The market price is taken approximately one month prior to the official grant date.
Similar arrangements have existed since 17 May 2002 in Ireland.
There are no performance conditions attached to the exercise of these options.
These options may be exercised within a fixed six-month period three or five years from the date of grant.
No SAYE options have been granted in the UK in 2005.
Instead, the Company introduced in the second half of 2005 a Share Investment Plan SIP as approved at the 2004 Annual General Meeting see below.

2003 L-TIP criteria Awards under the 2003 L-TIP are exercisable between three and seven years from the date of grant.
Provided the individuals performance criteria are met the award vests if, over a consecutive three year period, the growth in the Groups EPS is 10% higher than the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index.
None of the award vests if the growth in EPS is less than 6% above the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index over the same period.

qxd 30 03 2006 11:59 Page 73 9 Share-based payments continued d Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme DABS Options were granted under the DABS scheme for the first time in 2005.
The DABS operates by inviting participants including Executive Directors to use up to 50% of their annual performance related cash bonus after income tax and national insurance in respect of the preceding financial year to purchase shares in the Company.
Providing certain criteria are met, participants purchasing such shares will be eligible to receive nil cost matching shares up to a maximum of one per share purchased by the participant.
The criteria are as follows: Percentage of award vesting Percentage growth in the Groups EPS over the three year period from the commencement of the financial year in which the award is made exceeds the percentage growth in the Retail Price Index over the same period by: Less than 3% per annum compounded None of the award vests 3% per annum compounded 50% of the award vests Between 3% and 5% per annum compounded Award vests proportionately between 50% and 100% 5% per annum compounded 100% of the award vests DABS issued after 7 November 2002 as at 31 December 2005 Options Granted and outstanding at end of year 16,036 None of the above share options outstanding at the end of the year are exercisable at 31 December 2005.

e Share Incentive Plan SIP Shares were granted under the SIP scheme for the first time in 2005.
The SIP is a HM Revenue and Customs approved scheme and operates by inviting participants including Executive Directors to purchase shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner on a monthly basis.
For each share purchased by the employee, the Company will match one free share up to a maximum of four free shares per month.
No performance criteria is attached to these matching shares other than to avoid forfeiture they must remain within the plan for a minimum of two years.
In 2005, 7,845 matching shares were granted during the year.
Given the nature of the scheme, the fair value of the matching shares equates to the cost of the Company acquiring these shares.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for these value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs.
The Directors estimate discount rates using post tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the individual CGU.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts using the following years operating budget approved by the Directors and an appropriate extrapolation of cash flows for the next five years.
After five years, the cash flow forecast assumes no change in annual cash flows.
At 31 December 2005, prior to impairment testing, goodwill of 5.654m was allocated to the Groups Screenbase division which forms part of the UKs Commercial Interiors business.
The Screenbase division is identified as a separate CGU.
Screenbase was acquired in October 2000 and produces freestanding and desk mounted office screens.
Recently, the market for these products has fundamentally changed and reduced in value, and therefore, the Group has revised its cash flow forecasts for this business.
As a result, the goodwill attributable to this business has been written down by 5.654m, i. e. to nil net book value.
The impairment loss of 5.654m is shown separately on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement under operating expenses, together with the amortisation of acquired intangibles.
The discount rate used in the impairment review of Screenbase was 8% which represents its post tax weighted average cost of capital, the basis of which has also been used in prior impairment reviews.
The growth rate assumed in the impairment review for years two to six was 3%.
No other instances of goodwill impairment were noted from the annual impairment tests performed.
The remaining carrying amount of goodwill of 164.675m has been allocated across multiple CGUs.
There are no individual amounts of goodwill allocated to a CGU that are significant in comparison to the overall carrying amount of goodwill.

As detailed in the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies, SIG has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions that took place before 1 January 2004.
During 2004 and 2005, the Group owned purchased intangible assets with an insignificant book value mainly software separable from any associated hardware and these have not been reclassified from property, plant and equipment on the grounds of materiality.

The weighted average amortisation period for each category of intangible asset is disclosed in the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies on page 59.
In the opinion of the Directors, the only intangible asset which has an indefinite useful life is the brand attributable to the acquisition of LS Group Limited.
The carrying value of the LS brand at the balance sheet date is 12.646m.
An indefinite useful life has been determined for the LS brand on the basis that it is expected to be maintained indefinitely and is expected to continue to drive value for the Group.
The recoverable value of the brand is based upon value in use calculations.
Further information on value in use calculations is provided within Note 11.
The Directors have used past experience in determining each of the key assumptions in the value in use calculation for the LS brand.
The growth rates assumed are in line with industry expectations and, for periods beyond those covered by its management forecasts, do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the industry.
The discount rate applied is 8%, equivalent to its weighted average cost of capital.

Due to the proximity of the timing of some of the acquisitions close to the year end, the Directors have made a provisional assessment of the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Any further adjustments arising will be accounted for in 2006.
Included within goodwill are the following assets which are specifically excluded by IFRS 2 in the identification of intangible assets on acquisition: staff acquired as part of the business: and strategic acquisition synergies.
The pre-acquisition revenue and operating profit for LS Group, which was acquired on 24 June 2005, for the six months ended 24 June 2005 amounted to 18.595m and 2.617m respectively.
The 2005 Consolidated Income Statement includes the following amounts in respect of LS Group: revenue 22.838m: cost of sales 12.747m: and operating expenses 6.823m giving an operating profit of 3.268m.

qxd 30 03 2006 11:59 Page 79 13 Acquisitions continued The Directors estimate the pre-acquisition revenue and operating profit for the other acquisitions for the period from 1 January 2005 to the respective acquisition dates amounted to 68.4m and 5.8m respectively.
The 2005 Consolidated Income Statement includes the following amounts in respect of the other acquisitions: revenue 35.352m: cost of sales 25.115m: and operating expenses 7.758m giving an operating profit of 2.479m.
Acquisitions made in the year had the following impact on the Groups cash flows in 2005: cash inflow from operating activities 5.795m 2004: 1.125m : borrowing costs paid 1.389m 2004: 0.049m : purchase of property, plant and equipment 1.018m 2004: 0.114m : repayment of loans 3.247m 2004: nil : and income tax paid 1.034m 2004: 0.624m.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximate to their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash balances and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables for which an allowance has been made for the estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counter-parties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.

The remaining Group balances are unsecured.
The bank overdraft is repayable on demand and attracts a floating interest rate which at 31 December 2005 was 3.2%.
55.000m of the bank loans and loan notes due within one year after taking into account derivative financial instruments are at variable rates of interest.
42.401m of the bank loans and loan notes due within one year after taking into account derivative financial instruments attract an average fixed interest rate of 5.1%.
Trade payables and accruals and deferred income principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.
The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 37 days 2004: 39 days.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of current liabilities approximate to their fair value.

The US Senior loan notes are unsecured, repayable in 2008 25.566m and 2011 45.093m and before applying associated derivative financial instruments, as referred to in Note 18, attract an average interest rate of 7.2%.
At 1 January 2005, the US Senior loan note debt and its associated derivative financial instruments was restated in accordance with IFRS.
The effect of this transition is detailed within Note 28.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of non-current liabilities approximate to their fair value.

qxd 30 03 2006 11:59 Page 82 Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Derivative financial instruments The Treasury risk management section of the Business Review on pages 21 and 22 provides an explanation of the role that derivative financial instruments have had during the year in creating or changing the risks the Group faces in its activities.
The Group has no financial assets other than cash at bank including cash deposits repayable on demand of 32.120m 2004: 19.467m which are part of the financing arrangements of the Group.
The Directors consider the fair value of these financial assets to approximate to their book value.
2005 interest rate and currency profile The interest rate and currency profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2005, after taking account of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments with the exception of the short term currency swaps noted after the table was as follows: Weighted Effective average time Floating Fixed fixed for which Amount Amount Total rate rate interest rate rate is fixed secured unsecured Currency 000s 000s 000s % Years 000s 000s US Senior loan notes Sterling 30,742 30,742 7.2% 3.0 30,742 Other borrowings Sterling 96,841 49,216 47,625 4.9% 3.3 96,841 Finance lease contracts Sterling 525 525 6.1% 2.5 525 US Senior loan notes Euro 68,002 68,002 6.7% 4.1 68,002 Other borrowings Euro 8,553 7,883 670 3.4% 12.0 664 7,889 Finance lease contracts Euro 1,069 1,069 5.1% 2.7 1,069 Other borrowings US Dollar 1,111 1,111 1,111 Total 206,843 58,210 148,633 3,369 203,474 In addition to the currency exposures above, the Group has entered into three short term currency derivative contracts amounting to an asset of 76.950m and liability of 112.138m.
All of these contracts were entered into on 30 December 2005 so they are deemed to have a book value and fair value of nil.
The expiry date of these contracts is 29 December 2006.
The Directors consider the fair value of the Groups floating rate financial liabilities to approximate to the book value shown in the table above.
The fair value of the Groups US Senior loan notes approximates to the amount in the value of the financial liabilities above as a result of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 at 1 January 2005.
40.292m of the Sterling Other borrowings relate to debt on which the Group has taken out interest rate derivatives to fix the interest rate and the loan is already carried at approximately its fair value in the table above.
The remaining fixed rate debt amounts to 9.597m and relates predominantly to loan notes provided by previous owners of the acquired businesses and finance lease contracts.
The Directors consider the fair value of these remaining fixed rate debts to approximate to the book values shown above.
The Group applied IAS 32 and IAS 39 with effect from 1 January 2005.
The following financial instrument disclosures for 2004 are therefore in compliance with the requirements of FRS 13.
2004 interest rate and currency profile The following discloses the interest rate and currency profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2004, after taking account of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments were as follows: Weighted Weighted average time Floating Fixed average fixed for which Amount Amount Total rate rate interest rate rate is fixed secured unsecured Currency 000s 000s 000s % Years 000s 000s US Senior loan notes Sterling 24,149 24,149 7.2% 4.0 24,149 Other borrowings Sterling 12,014 12,014 3.8% 1.0 1,261 10,753 Finance lease contracts Sterling 1,068 1,068 5.7% 1.7 1,068 US Senior loan notes Euro 70,119 70,119 6.7% 5.1 70,119 Other borrowings Euro 3,817 2,598 1,219 3.6% 13.0 1,200 2,617 Finance lease contracts Euro 888 888 5.5% 1.4 888 Other borrowings US Dollar 5,730 652 5,078 2.9% 0.1 652 5,078 Total 117,785 3,250 114,535 5,069 112,716 The estimated fair value of the financial liabilities at 31 December 2004 was: Book Fair value value 000s 000s US Senior loan notes 94,268 63,854 US Senior loan note derivative financial instruments 37,039 Finance lease contracts and other borrowings 23,517 23,517 117,785 124,410 82 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Accounts 02 0SIG 2005ARB.
qxd 30 03 2006 11:59 Page 83 18 Derivatives financial instruments continued The difference between the book value and fair value of the debt shown on page 96 of 6.625m has been booked as a transitional adjustment at 1 January 2005, as described in Note 28.
In both 2005 and 2004, the interest rate on floating rate financial liabilities is linked to UK LIBOR in the case of Sterling liabilities, EURIBOR for Euro liabilities, US prime rate and US LIBOR for US Dollar liabilities.
Transactional exposures that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement are minimal as Group companies do not enter into significant amounts of cross border transactions.
The amount arising in the Group during 2005 in respect of transactional exposures amounted to a gain of 132,000 2004: loss of 197,000.
Hedging relationships The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Where the Group can demonstrate a hedge relationship under the rules of IAS 32 and IAS 39, movements in the fair values of these derivative financial instruments will be recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Where the Group does not meet these rules, movements in the fair value will be recognised as hedge ineffectiveness and disclosed separately on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement.
In order to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate and exchange rate changes, the Group utilises both currency and interest rate derivative financial instruments.
The fair value of these derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the associated future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
a Net investment hedges At 31 December 2005, the Group had entered into three cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instruments which form a net investment hedge of the Groups Euro denominated trading assets.
At 31 December 2005, these three derivative financial instruments had a fair value liability of 11.434m 1 January 2005: 15.276m.
Of this fair value movement, 1.880m has been recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement as hedge ineffectiveness and 1.962m has been recognised directly in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
b Cash flow hedges With regard to cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in equity, and is subsequently removed and included in the Consolidated Income Statement in the same period the hedged item affects the Consolidated Income Statement.
At 31 December 2005, the Group had entered into four cross-currency interest rate derivative financial instruments which swap fixed US Dollar denominated debt held in the UK into fixed Sterling denominated debt.
These derivative financial instruments form a cash flow hedge as they fix the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
At 31 December 2005, these four derivative financial instruments had a fair value liability of 16.650m 1 January 2005: 21.763m.
All of these derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
At 31 December 2005, the average maturity date of the these swaps is 3.8 years 2004: 4.8 years.
At 31 December 2005, the Group had entered into two interest rate derivative financial instruments which swap variable rate Sterling debt into fixed rate Sterling debt thereby fixing the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
At 31 December 2005, these two derivative financial instruments had a fair value liability of 0.292m 1 January 2005: n a.
Both of these interest rate derivative financial instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value movement has therefore been deferred in equity via the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
At 31 December 2005, the average maturity date of the these swaps is 3.6 years.
At 31 December 2005, the Group had entered into two cross-currency derivative financial instruments which swap fixed Sterling denominated debt into fixed Euro denominated debt.
The movement in fair value of these derivative financial instruments hedge the post tax Euro cash flows of the Group and thereby fix the functional currency cash flows of the Group.
As these derivative financial instruments were entered into on 30 December 2005 at market rates prevailing at that date, the fair value of these derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2005 was nil.
At 31 December 2005, the average maturity date of the these swaps is one year.
The fair value comparatives included in the narrative above are stated at 1 January 2005 as the Group took the exemption available under IFRS 1 to adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39 for the first time as at that date.
Therefore, all comparative information at 31 December 2004 is stated under UK GAAP.
c Fair value hedges The Group has not entered into any fair value hedges in the period.

The provision has been calculated after taking into account both the periods over which properties are likely to remain vacant and the likely income from existing and future sub lease agreements on a contract by contract basis.
The provision covers potential transfer of economic benefit over the full range of current lease commitments disclosed in Note 27.
Leasehold dilapidations This provision relates to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties into their original state of repair at the end of the lease.
The provisions are calculated with reference to the expired portion of individual lease agreements where such a clause exists in the lease contract.
The transfer of economic benefits will be made at the end of the leases as set out in Note 27.
Other amounts relate principally to claims provisions.

At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries with a lower rate of corporation tax than that suffered in the UK, for which no deferred tax liabilities have been recognised, was 29.396m 2004: 16.692m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The rentals payable are subject to renegotiation at various dates.
The total future minimum lease rentals under the foregoing leases are as follows: 2005 2004 000s 000s Minimum lease rentals due: Within one year 26,147 24,892 After one year and within five years 75,816 67,272 After five years 86,268 63,082 188,231 155,246 The Group also leases certain items of plant and machinery whose total future minimum lease rentals under the foregoing leases are as follows: 2005 2004 000s 000s Minimum lease rentals due: Within one year 3,937 4,390 After one year and within five years 5,350 4,407 After five years 84 84 9,371 8,881 c Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes, six 2004: six of which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable salary.
Of these schemes, four 2004: four have assets held in separate trustee administered funds and two 2004: two are overseas book reserved schemes.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes all of which are independently managed.
The defined benefit schemes are herein after referred to as the main scheme and other schemes, being five smaller schemes.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations In accordance with the amendment to IAS 19 which was issued on 16 December 2004, the Group has elected to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they arise in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The actuarial valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes are assessed by an independent actuary every three years who recommends the rate of contribution payable each year.
The main actuarial assumptions in the pension assessments were that over the long term the annual investment return would be 2% higher than the annual increase in pensionable salaries, and after retirement 2.5% higher than the annual price inflation-linked increase in pensions.
The last formal actuarial valuations of three of the defined benefit schemes including the main scheme were conducted at 1 January 2004, and showed that the market value of the schemes assets were 29.7m, 7.8m and 1.9m and their actuarial values covered 64%, 94% and 70% respectively of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the fourth defined benefit scheme was at 6 April 2004 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 1.2m and its actuarial value covered 60% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The fifth and sixth schemes are book reserved schemes whereby the sponsoring company does not hold any separate assets to fund the pension scheme but makes a reserve in its accounts.
Therefore, these schemes do not hold separate scheme assets.
The liabilities of the schemes are met by the sponsoring companies.

qxd 30 03 2006 11:59 Page 91 27 Guarantees and other financial commitments continued c Pension schemes continued Consolidated Income Statement charges The pension charge for the year relating to the main scheme was 1.983m 2004: 1.444m, 0.852m 2004: 0.432m in relation to other schemes and was 2.835m 2004: 2.521m in relation to defined contribution schemes.
In accordance with IAS 19 Retirement benefits, the charge for the defined benefit schemes has been calculated as the sum of the cost of benefits accruing in the year, the increase in the value of benefits already accrued and the expected return on assets.
The Group contribution to the main scheme including fixed monthly contributions during the year amounted to 35.0% 2004: 31.7% of pensionable salaries.
In addition, in December 2004, a special contribution of 4.0m was made to the main scheme.
The actuarial valuations described above have been updated at 31 December 2005 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The four UK defined benefit schemes are closed to new members, have an age profile that is rising and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
The two overseas book reserved schemes remain open to new members.
Consolidated Balance Sheet liability The net Consolidated Balance Sheet liability position in respect of the six defined benefit schemes can be summarised as follows: 2005 2005 2004 2004 000s 000s 000s 000s Deficit in the main scheme 19,679 18,870 Deficit in the other schemes 7,308 6,165 Gross pension liability 26,987 25,035 Related deferred tax asset 8,059 7,933 Net pension liability 18,928 17,102 The actuarial loss of 1.885m 2004: 8.741m for the year, together with the associated deferred tax credit of 0.563m 2004: 2.537m, has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Of the above gross pension liability, 24.864m relates to wholly or partly funded schemes and 2.123m relates to unfunded schemes.
The movement in the gross pension liability in the year can be summarised as follows: 2005 2004 000s 000s Pension liability at beginning of year 25,035 20,851 Current service cost 1,982 1,402 Contributions 2,845 6,450 Net finance cost 853 474 Actuarial loss 1,885 8,741 Exchange difference 77 17 Pension liability at end of year 26,987 25,035 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 91 02 0SIG 2005ARB.

Of this amount, 5.445m 2004: 3.975m related to standby letters of credit, issued by The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, in respect of the Groups insurance arrangements.
In addition, the remaining 6.5% share in the equity of LS Group Limited is to be purchased for a variable consideration dependent upon its future profit performance.
The consideration payable varies from a minimum of 1.7m to a maximum of 5.2m.
At the balance sheet date, it is not possible to accurately determine the likely consideration payable as it is inherently uncertain.
28 Transitional adjustment to adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39 at 1 January 2005 The Group has derivative financial instruments associated with its US Senior loan notes, being interest and foreign currency contracts.
These convert the Groups interest and loan principal payments under the US Senior loan notes into Sterling and Euro currencies in order to fund the Groups UK and European operations.
Previously under UK GAAP, the Group recognised the book value of its derivative financial instruments in the carrying value of its US Senior loan note debt.
The Group has elected to apply UK GAAP to its comparative Accounts i. e. 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2004 and implement IAS 32 and IAS 39 at 1 January 2005.
On 1 January 2005, in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39, all derivative financial instruments are recorded at their fair value.
The difference between the fair value and book value of all derivative financial instruments at 1 January 2005 was 6.625m, being an additional liability for the Group.
In addition, as a result of further guidance issued by the UK tax authorities regarding the tax treatment of transitional adjustments relating to derivative financial instruments and foreign currency exchange differences, the Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of 3.869m at 1 January 2005.
Both of these transitional adjustments have been recorded in 2005 through the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The table below shows the effect of including the fair value of these derivative financial instruments and the associated deferred tax assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at 1 January 2005: UK GAAP IFRS 000s 000s At 1 January 2005 US Senior loan note debt 94,268 63,854 US Senior loan note derivative financial instruments 37,039 Total 94,268 100,893 Additional liability under IFRS 6,625 Deferred tax assets 3,869 Reduction in net assets at 1 January 2005 as a result of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 2,756 Under UK GAAP, the debt is valued as a composite liability by converting the Sterling and Euro principal values featuring in the loan note derivative financial instruments at the closing rates of exchange at the balance sheet date.
The Sterling value of this debt therefore moves with the Sterling: Euro exchange rate.
Under IFRS, the US Senior loan notes are valued at the closing US Dollar: Sterling exchange rate.
The derivative financial instruments are valued at their fair market value at the balance sheet date.
It must be noted that the recognition of this additional 6.625m liability as a result of adopting IFRS will not impact the cash flows of the Group.
Upon expiry of these derivative financial instruments in 2008 and 2011, the value of the loan notes and the associated derivative financial instruments under IFRS will equal the equivalent UK GAAP book value of the composite debt at that time.
29 Related party transactions Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and have therefore not been disclosed.
Remuneration of key management personnel The remuneration of the Directors who are the key management personnel of SIG is provided in the audited part of the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 47 to 50.

qxd 30 03 2006 11:59 Page 97 31 Explanation of transition to IFRS This is the first year that the Group has presented its Annual Report and Accounts under IFRS.
The Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004 were under UK GAAP and the date of transition was therefore 1 January 2004.
A document entitled Final Restatement of 2004 Financial Information has now been published on SIGs website: www.
This provides comprehensive analysis of the effect of moving from UK GAAP to IFRS and specifically contains: the restatement of 2004 comparative financial information from UK GAAP to IFRS, including a reconciliation of equity from UK GAAP to IFRS at the date of transition and 31 December 2004: a summary of significant accounting policies and a description of all IFRS adjustments made: and an unqualified independent auditors report on the Restatement Document.
A number of summary disclosures are provided in this Note.

The change in presentation of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement under IAS 7 makes no difference to the cash flows of the Group.

qxd 30 03 2006 11:59 Page 98 Notes to the Accounts continued 31 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Description of IFRS adjustments IFRS 2 Share-based payments In accordance with IFRS 2, SIG has recognised an expense representing the fair value of outstanding employee share options spread over their vesting periods.
As permitted by the transitional provisions, SIG has taken the option to apply IFRS 2 only to those share options granted after 7 November 2002 that remained unvested as at 1 January 2005.
SIG issues equity-settled share-based payment options on an annual basis in respect of which under IFRS a charge is required to be made in the Consolidated Income Statement.
At the date of grant, these options are measured at fair value by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The fair value of each option is then applied to the number of options which are expected to vest.
The estimate of the number of options that might vest is adjusted over the vesting period to reflect actual experience.
The fair value determined at the grant date is then expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
Previously as required by UK GAAP, SIG accounted only for certain equity-settled share-based payment options in its Consolidated Income Statement i. e. in respect of its L-TIP schemes under UITF 17, whereby the difference between the share price on the date of grant and the share option price of 10p at that time was spread over the vesting period.
IAS 19 Employee benefits IAS 19 requires the Groups pensions deficit to be recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Under UK GAAP, the Group adopted FRS 17 which also required the recognition of the pension deficit in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
As detailed in the Statement of Significant Accounting Policies, the Groups restatement from UK GAAP to IFRS has applied the amendments to IAS 19 Employee benefits, allowing pension actuarial gains and losses to be recognised in full through the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Under FRS 17, the normal method of valuing listed investments and other investments with a market value is at the mid market price.
Under IAS 19, assets are valued using the bid price.
IAS 21 Goodwill retranslation IAS 21 permits the retranslation of foreign currency denominated goodwill at each period end.
Any movements in the carrying value of goodwill as a result of foreign exchange rate movements are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Under UK GAAP, the Group opted to carry foreign currency denominated goodwill at its historic cost value.
Under IFRS, the Group has chosen to retranslate this goodwill.
IFRS 3 Business combinations The method of accounting for business combinations under IFRS is different to that applied under UK GAAP.
The key differences applicable to the Group are the cessation of goodwill amortisation and the recognition and amortisation of intangible assets within acquired businesses.
Under the transitional arrangements of IFRS 1, the Group has taken the option to apply IFRS 3 to business combinations from the transition date only i. e. 1 January 2004, and therefore has not restated acquisitions prior to this date.
IAS 12 Taxation Under IAS 12, deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences between income reported in the Accounts and that recognised in the respective tax computations as opposed to timing differences under UK GAAP.
Temporary differences are generally more comprehensive than timing differences.
However, IAS 12 does not allow temporary differences to be recognised on: a Goodwill not deductible for taxation purposes: b The initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit: and c Differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date Under UK GAAP, the Group accrued for the estimated cost of dividends recommended by the Directors in respect of each accounting year.
Under IFRS, a dividend is only recognised when it has been declared.
As a result, proposed dividends are not recognised in the Accounts.
IAS 17 Lease incentives Under UK GAAP, property lease incentives were recognised over the period to the first market rent review.
Under IFRS, lease incentives are required to be spread over the entire lease term.
As a result, the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes additional deferred income for lease incentives.
IAS 2 Inventories Under IAS 2, settlement discounts are to be included in the carrying value of inventories.
Under UK GAAP, no such requirement existed.
IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial instruments These standards address the accounting for, and disclosure of, financial instruments.
The general principle is that all financial assets and liabilities be recognised at fair value.
Unless hedge accounting is achieved, IFRS requires movements in the fair value to be recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group has taken the option available under IFRS 1 that permits UK GAAP to be applied in 2004, with IAS 32 and IAS 39 being adopted for the first time on 1 January 2005.
