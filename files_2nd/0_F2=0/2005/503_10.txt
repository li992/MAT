Directors Responsibilities Company law requires the Directors to prepare Accounts for each financial period which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss for that period.
In preparing those Accounts, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Accounts: and prepare Accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the Accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for the Groups system of internal control and safeguarding its assets and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that these Accounts comply with the foregoing requirements.
