Events after the balance sheet date On 12 January 2006, the Group agreed to acquire the investment management and private banking business of Dexia Banque Internationale Luxembourg S. A. London Branch.
The business will be transferred to Rathbone Investment Management Limited by way of a Court order sanctioning a banking business transfer scheme pursuant to Part VII of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
The acquisition is subject to regulatory and Court approval.
The Court hearing is scheduled for 23 March 2006 and it is expected that completion will take place during April 2006.
The business to be acquired consists of approximately 50 million in loans and 20 million of deposits in addition to uninvested capital balances from client portfolios of approximately 30 million : and is being purchased at book value.
The consideration payable, made up of initial and deferred amounts, will be a maximum amount of 14 million and is ultimately dependent on the value of the funds under management transferred.
Explanation of transition to IFRS This is the first year that the Group has presented its accounts under IFRS.
The following disclosures are required in the year of transition to describe how the transition from UK generally accepted accounting principles UK GAAP has affected the reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Group.
The earliest period for which full comparative information is presented in accordance with IFRS is the year ended 31 December 2004 and the date of transition to IFRS was therefore 1 January 2004.
References to the opening balance sheet relate to the Groups consolidated balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 and references to the closing balance sheet relate to the Groups consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2004.
com Report and accounts 2005 Page 80 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 35.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Transitional arrangements IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards permits companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS in the transition period.
The Groups application of the optional exemptions is as follows: Business combinations The Group has chosen not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004.
Employee benefits The Group has chosen to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses associated with the Groups defined benefit schemes at the date of transition.
Share based payments The Group has chosen not to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payment to share and share option awards that were granted on or before 7 November 2002 or to those granted after 7 November 2002 which vested before 1 January 2005.
Exemption from using IAS 32 and IAS 39 in comparatives The Group has chosen not to take advantage of the exemption within IFRS 1 that allows comparative information presented in the first year of adoption of IFRS not to comply with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Key impacts of IFRS The significant differences between UK GAAP and IFRS which impact on the Groups financial position, financial performance and cash flows are set out below.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, the Group has chosen to apply IFRS 3 prospectively from the date of transition.
This results in the value of goodwill arising from previous acquisitions being frozen at the value held on the Group balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 and the reversal of any amortisation charged in the year to 31 December 2004.
From 1 January 2004, goodwill is subject to an annual impairment review in accordance with the standard and will be impaired where there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill was amortised over expected useful lives of between 8 20 years.
This change results in the reversal of 5.9 million previously charged to the income statement under UK GAAP for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Closing balance sheet equity is therefore also increased by 5.9 million.
IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date Under IAS 10, assets and liabilities should be adjusted for subsequent events that existed at the balance sheet date, but not for events that are indicative of conditions that arose subsequent to the balance sheet date.
The main effect of this is that under IAS 10, entities are not permitted to recognise a liability for dividends declared after the balance sheet date.
Under previous UK GAAP proposed dividends at the half year and year end were accrued although there is no obligation to pay until the dividend is declared.
Final dividends are now recorded as an appropriation of shareholders funds in the period that they are declared by the Board.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
The overall impact of this change is to increase opening balance sheet equity by 6.5 million and closing balance sheet equity by 6.9 million.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment The Group recognises a charge to the income statement for the fair value of outstanding share options and share awards in relation to the Groups Share Incentive Plan SIP and Long Term Incentive Plan granted to employees after 7 November 2002 and not vested by 1 January 2005.
The charges are calculated using a binomial valuation model or Monte Carlo simulation techniques, as appropriate, and are spread over the relevant vesting periods, taking account of actual and expected levels of vesting, where appropriate.
The levels of vesting are dependent on performance conditions and forfeit rates.
Under UK GAAP, there was no charge in the income statement in relation to share option awards but there were charges for share awards granted before 7 November 2002.
In relation to the SIP free shares, the charge was recognised in the performance year, whereas under IFRS the charge is spread over the vesting period of 4.25 years.
There is a positive impact of 1.8 million on profit before tax for the year.
com Report and accounts 2005 Page 81 IAS 19 Employee Benefits The Group recognises the net liability on defined benefit schemes in the balance sheet and takes all actuarial gains and losses to the statement of recognised income and expense, in accordance with the permitted methods of recognition on early adoption of the amendment to IAS 19, issued in December 2004.
Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for the defined benefit schemes in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs.
These changes reduce opening balance sheet equity by 14.7 million.
The effect on the profit for the year is an increase of 0.2 million.
Actuarial losses of 0.9 million have been recognised directly in equity.
Closing balance sheet equity is reduced by 15.7 million.
IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement In considering the options available under IAS 39, the Group has elected to adopt the following classifications for financial assets: held-to-maturity for certificates of deposit which will therefore continue to be held in the balance sheet at amortised cost available-for-sale for equity shares with gains and losses on revaluation being taken directly to equity Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value with gains and losses on revaluation being taken to profit and loss.
The fair value of equity shares which were reclassified as available for sale securities on transition to IFRS was 5,800,479.
The carrying value of these equity shares in the previous financial statements was 35,002.
The impact of the changes is to increase opening balance sheet equity by 5.8 million and closing balance sheet equity by 7.2 million.
IAS 38 Intangible Assets The Group capitalises certain software expenditure as intangible assets where the expenditure meets the criteria for capitalisation as set out in the standard.
Under UK GAAP, software expenditure was either classified as tangible fixed assets or expensed in the income statement.
The change increases opening and closing balance sheet equity by 0.3 million.
IAS 18 Revenue Under IAS 18, when the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services can be estimated reliably, revenue associated with the transaction should be recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
In relation to the Groups work in progress for trust and pension services, valuation will be at the expected recoverable amount rather than the UK GAAP treatment of valuing at the lower of cost and expected recoverable amount.
The principles of IAS 18 and IAS 39 have also been interpreted as applying to some of the income streams in the unit trust business.
The Group is spreading an element of its unit trust income over the estimated average life of the related unit holdings.
The impact of IAS 18 on the Group is a decrease of 0.1 million in opening balance sheet equity, 0.4 million in profit and 0.5 million in closing balance sheet equity.
IAS 12 Income Taxes The Groups effective tax rate under IFRS is 30.0% compared to 37.1% under UK GAAP.
This is principally due to the changed treatment of goodwill referred to earlier and in part, due to the provision of deferred tax for overseas earnings expected to be remitted in the foreseeable future.
Under UK GAAP, no provision was made for unremitted overseas earnings in the absence of binding agreements with the Groups overseas subsidiaries.
IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements The Group has prepared its cash flow statement in accordance with IAS 7.
Under IAS 7, the cash flow statement shows the movement in cash and cash equivalents, being defined as cash on hand, demand deposits and short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Under UK GAAP, the Groups cash flow statement showed the movement in cash repayable on demand only and in particular, excluded short term highly liquid investments.
This change in definition from cash to cash and cash equivalents results in an increase of cash under UK GAAP of 17.3 million changing to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 3.4 million under IFRS, although it should be noted that for regulatory solvency purposes, the marketability of the whole portfolio of certificates of deposit is taken into account.
All other adjustments made to the cash flow statement for IFRS represent reclassifications between line items and have not impacted actual cash flows.
