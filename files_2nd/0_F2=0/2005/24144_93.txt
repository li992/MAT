150,249,291 ordinary shares of Friends Provident plc were issued for the acquisition in three individual allotments 1st allotment: 113,477,763 shares at 1.645 per share, 2nd allotment: 389,414 shares at 1.733 per share and 3rd allotment: 36,382,114 shares at 1.705 per share.
Future consideration represents future earn-out payments to be made which are variable on Lombards performance.
Earn-out payments in respect of 2004 performance have already been settled in shares: further consideration is due in respect of earn-out for 2005 and 2006 performance.
The payments are dependent on Lombard achieving certain performance thresholds for both new business profits and underlying embedded value.
Earn-out payments are payable in shares or cash, at the Groups option.
The payment in respect of 2004 was capped at u90m 62m and payment in respect of 2005 will be capped at u85m 58m with any excess combined with the final potential payment in respect of the 2006 year.
The goodwill of 151m is attributable to the quality, experience and knowledge of Lombard management and staff, which is expected to generate significant new business value in the foreseeable future.
Such experience and knowledge manifests itself in existing business relationships and the ability to maintain and further develop these, and processes that are not captured in separately identifiable intangible assets.
The diversification of Lombards business and the flexible business model and relatively unique competitive position also adds significant value.
Illustrations of the future earn-out payments have been made on a range of scenarios.
Each scenario assumes a payment for 2005 of u85m, and a payment for 2006 based on a growth in new business profits from a 2005 base.

The impact of Lombard on the result for 2005 has been to increase revenue by 568m and profit before tax by 8m.

The group acquired is predominantly a European-wide Asset Management business.
The business combination is being accounted for as an acquisition.
On the completion date of 11 October 2004, ISIS was re-named F&C Asset Management plc F&C.
The table below reconciles the book value on a UK GAAP basis of the assets acquired and other fair value adjustments, including adjustments required to convert to IFRS, to the final fair value of the assets acquired.
During 2005, following the review of the completion accounts and subsequent agreement with Eureko BV regarding adjustments to the purchase consideration, additional adjustments were made to determine the fair value of assets acquired.

IFRS 3 requires fair value adjustments to be reflected as if they had been determined as at the date of the acquisition.
As a result, the fair value adjustments made during 2005, in respect of balances as at 11 October 2004, have necessitated the restatement of certain balances as at 31 December 2004.

Taxation adjustments have been made to reflect the taxation effect of the non-taxation fair value adjustments, together with an additional provision in respect of tax obligations in existence as at 11 October 2004, as a result of the submission of prior period tax computations.
As the acquired entities did not constitute a statutory group for the whole period of 2004 prior to the date of the acquisition, it is not practical to present the revenue or profit of the acquired group for the entirety of 2004 as if the acquisition had been effected as at 1 January 2004.
The Groups interest in the ordinary shares of ISIS fell from 67% to 51% 52.5% excluding those shares held in Treasury following the issue of 331m new ordinary shares by ISIS, 145m of which were issued to the Group.
The remainder of these shares were issued to Eureko BV and F&C.
This gives rise to a deemed disposal of a stake in ISIS by the company for which the consideration was 50m, calculated as the fair value of the holding deemed to have been disposed of.
A profit of 37m arose on the deemed disposal.
Following the finalisation of the fair value of the net assets acquired by F&C, the additional consideration for the acquisition of 16m disclosed in the 2004 annual report and accounts has been reduced to 3m, of which the Groups share is 2m 2004: 8m.
Acquisition costs include the Groups share of 13m of expenses incurred by ISIS in connection with the acquisition and the Groups own costs of 3m.
