For these instruments, which are mostly held by Barclays Capital, liquidity and repricing risk is managed through the Daily Value at Risk DVaR methodology, see Note 54 for more information.
Retail deposits which are repayable on demand or at short notice form a stable base for the Groups operations and liquidity needs because of the broad base of customers numerically and by depositor type.
