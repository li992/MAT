6 Dividends The Diageo plc board expects that Diageo will pay an interim dividend in April and a final dividend in October of each year.
Approximately 40% of the total dividend in respect of any financial year is expected to be paid as an interim dividend and approximately 60% as a final dividend.
The payment of any future dividends, subject to shareholder approval, will depend upon Diageos earnings, financial condition and such other factors as the Diageo plc board deems relevant.
The table below sets out the amounts of interim, final and total cash dividends paid by Diageo plc on each ordinary share.
The dividends are translated into US dollars per ADS each ADS representing four ordinary shares at the noon buying rate on each of the respective dividend payment dates.
Payment to US ADR holders will be made on 28 October 2005.
In the table above, an exchange rate of 1 $1.79 has been assumed.
The exact amount of the payment to US ADR holders will be determined by the rate of exchange on 24 October 2005.

9 Burger King Under UK GAAP, the sale of Burger King was accounted for as a disposal and the results prior to disposal are presented within discontinued operations.
Under US GAAP, the transaction is not accounted for as a disposal due to the size of the investment made by the buyer and Diageos continuing involvement through the guarantee provided by Diageo in respect of the acquisition finance.
Under US GAAP, the results of Burger King prior to 13 December 2002 the completion date are presented as continuing operations in the income statement and, on the completion of the transaction, a charge for impairment has been recognised rather than a loss on disposal.
Following the completion date, Diageo does not recognise profits of Burger King in its income statement but would, generally, reect losses as an impairment charge against the assets retained on the balance sheet.
In the US GAAP balance sheet, the total assets and total liabilities of Burger King at 30 June 2005 including consideration deferred under US GAAP classied within other long term assets and other long term liabilities were each 1.2 billion 2004 1.2 billion.
On 13 July 2005 Burger King renanced its external borrowings on a stand-alone basis, releasing Diageo of its obligations under the guarantee relating to that debt.
