The Companys registered address is 4 New Square, Bedfont Lakes, Feltham, Middlesex, TW14 8HA, United Kingdom.
The Group comprises the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as set out below.
The Groups operations are primarily conducted through the Companys principal subsidiary, Kazakhmys Corporation LLC Kazakhmys LLC, in which the Company acquired a 97.40% interest as a result of a share exchange representing a combination of businesses under common control on 23 November 2004.
The share exchange is described in note 2a.
The Group operates in the mining industry.
Its major business is the mining and processing of copper ore into cathode copper and copper wire, and the refining and sale of precious metals and other by-products of its copper mining process.
It also provides other services to various external customers.
The principal activities of the Company and the significant subsidiaries as at 31 December 2005 are as follows: Operating entity Principal activity Country of incorporation Kazakhmys PLC Holding company and sales United Kingdom Kazakhmys Corporation LLC Mining and processing copper Republic of Kazakhstan MKM Mansfelder Kupfer und Messing GmbH Copper processing Federal Republic of Germany b Kazakhstan business environment and country risk The Groups operations are subject to country risk being the economic, political and social risks inherent in doing business in Kazakhstan.
These risks include matters arising out of the policies of the government, economic conditions, imposition of, or changes to, taxes and regulations, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the enforceability of contract rights.
The consolidated financial statements reflect the Directors assessment of the impact of the Kazakhstan business environment on the operations and the financial position of the Group.
The future business environment may differ from the Directors assessment.
c Financial risk management The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in the price of copper, which is quoted in US dollars on the international markets.
The Group is also exposed, to a lesser degree, to the prices of other metals, including zinc, gold and silver, which are also products produced by the Group.
Refer to note 32 for a description of other financial risks.
d Ore reserves and recoverability of fixed assets The Groups operations are dependent upon the mining and processing of copper ore from deposits in the vicinity of the Groups processing facilities near Zhezkazgan, Balkhash and East Region in Kazakhstan.
The long-term economic viability of the Group is dependent upon the continuing availability of sufficient economically recoverable ore reserves and the ongoing renewal of subsoil use rights.
Basis of preparation a Accounting for the share exchange agreements relating to the acquisition of Kazakhmys LLC Pursuant to various share exchange agreements entered into as a result of the offer made by the Company to shareholders of Kazakhmys LLC, the Company acquired Kazakhmys LLC on 23 November 2004 in consideration for the allotment of ordinary shares of 5 each in the Company or for a cash payment.
The consideration offered for each Kazakhmys LLC share was one ordinary share in the Company or a cash payment of Kazakhstan tenge KZT 4,736.
No shareholder elected to take the cash option and the offer period closed on 7 January 2005.
Pursuant to the share exchange agreements, the Company issued 15,580,210 ordinary shares of 5 each on or around 25 November 2004, a further 568,738 ordinary shares of 5 each were issued in the period 29 December 2004 to 23 August 2005 and an additional 2,000 ordinary shares of 20 pence each were issued on 29 December 2005, equivalent to 80 ordinary shares of 5 each prior to the share split which took place on 23 September 2005 refer to note 24 in which the Companys share capital was redenominated into ordinary shares of 20 pence each.
Immediately after the initial issue of shares pursuant to the share exchange agreements, the Companys interest in Kazakhmys LLC was 93.96%.
This interest increased to 97.40% upon completion of share allotments relating to the share exchange agreements.
As this transaction involved the combination of businesses under common control, the pooling of interests method of accounting has been applied in the presentation of the consolidated financial statements for the two years ended 31 December 2005 which present the results of the Group as if the Company had always been the parent company of Kazakhmys LLC.
The consolidated profit and loss account for the year ended 31 December 2004 combines the results of the Company from the date of incorporation to 31 December 2004 with those of Kazakhmys LLC for the year then ended.
The consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2004 consolidates the balance sheet of the Company and that of the Kazakhmys LLC group as at that date.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Kazakhmys PLC 69 2.
Basis of preparation continued b Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain classes of property, plant and equipment which have been revalued at 1 January 2002 to determine deemed cost as part of the first-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS at that date, and derivative financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars $ and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand $000 except when otherwise indicated.
c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements set out the Groups financial position as at 31 December 2005 and the Groups financial performance for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Subsidiaries are those enterprises controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
On acquisition of a subsidiary, the purchase consideration is allocated to the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities on the basis of their fair value at the date of acquisition.
The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identifiable net assets of the subsidiary acquired is recognised as positive goodwill.
Negative goodwill arises where the fair value of the Groups share of identifiable net assets of the subsidiary exceeds the cost of the acquisition.
Negative goodwill is recognised directly in the income statement.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Minority interests primarily represent the interests in Kazakhmys LLC not held by the Company.
Refer to note 55 for a list of the Companys significant subsidiaries.
d Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC of the IASB, as adopted by the European Union up to 31 December 2005.
Kazakhmys LLC, which previously prepared its financial statements under Kazakhstan Accounting Standards, had a transition date to IFRS of 1 January 2002.
As a result, no reconciliation of equity or results reported under Kazakhstan Accounting Standards and equity and results reported under IFRS is reported in these financial statements.
e Adoption of new standards and interpretations On 1 January 2005 the Group adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
There has been no material impact on the Group of adopting these standards.
f Early adoption of standards and interpretations The Group has adopted IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources for all reporting periods since 1 January 2002, its date of transition to IFRS.
g New standards and interpretations not yet adopted In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Group has not applied the following relevant standards and interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective: Amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures, which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and consequential amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007.
IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease, which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006.
The interpretation requires certain arrangements to be accounted for as a lease even if they are not in the legal form of a lease.
IFRIC 5 Rights to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds, which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006.
IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives, which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 June 2006.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
In addition to the above, further amendments to standards and new interpretations IFRICs 6-8 have been issued for which adoption is not currently mandatory.
It is the Directors view that these amendments to standards and interpretations do not apply to the activities of the Group.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 70 Kazakhmys PLC Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2005 2.
Basis of preparation continued h Significant accounting judgements and estimates i Judgements In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, the Directors have made the following judgements, apart from those involving estimates, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements: Impairment indicators The Group monitors internal and external indicators of impairment relating to its tangible and intangible assets.
Management has considered whether any indicators of impairment have arisen relating to the Groups investment in MKM, particularly with respect to the ability of MKMs plant and equipment to operate at its planned capacity within the foreseeable future.
After assessing the feasibility of the technological and financial plan of MKMs plant and equipment for the next 12 months, management has concluded that no impairment indicator has arisen during and since the end of the financial year.
Determination of excess profits taxation The determination of the Groups obligations and expenses for taxes requires an interpretation of tax law.
Excess profits tax EPT is imposed on the Group in addition to Kazakh corporate income tax on certain profitable subsoil contracts.
EPT is based on an approximation of the internal rate of return IRR with EPT being applicable only where the IRR in the current year exceeds 20%.
In determining the IRR for each subsoil contract, there is judgement involved as to the allocation of profit amongst the Groups subsoil contracts, and the nature of deductions for capital expenditure, and the timing of those deductions.
Management believes its judgements are reasonable and in compliance with the legislation, although there is a risk that the tax authorities will have a different interpretation of tax legislation.
Accounting for potential transfer pricing liabilities Prior to 31 December 2004, Kazakhmys LLC sold its exported products to Apro under an exclusive purchasing agreement.
Apro purchased products from the Group at a discount to the prevailing LME price to reflect the fact that the significant commercial and credit risks were borne by Apro.
Management exercised its judgement in ensuring the said discount was commensurate with the transfer of risks from Kazakhmys LLC to Apro.
Management has also recognised the nature of the transfer pricing legislation promulgated in Kazakhstan in determining any consequential tax liabilities in this jurisdiction resulting from the sale of exported products to Apro in the years 2002 to 2004. ii Estimation uncertainty The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual outcomes could differ from these estimates.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty made by the Directors in preparing the consolidated financial statements are described in the following notes: Note 11 Income tax Note 15 Property, plant and equipment Note 16 Mine stripping costs Note 26 Employee benefits Note 27 Provisions Note 33 Commitments and contingencies.
i Comparative figures Where a change in the presentational format of the consolidated financial statements has been made during the year, comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
j Changes in accounting policies There have been no changes in accounting policies.
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
Summary of significant accounting policies The following significant accounting policies have been applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
These accounting policies have been consistently applied.
a Foreign currency translation The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recorded in the functional currency rate ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates, are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Kazakhmys PLC 71 3.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued a Foreign currency translation continued The functional currency of the Company is US dollars $ as the majority of its operating activities are conducted in US dollars.
The functional currency of Kazakhmys LLC is the Kazakhstan tenge KZT and of MKM is the euro.
On consolidation, income statements of subsidiaries are translated into US dollars, at average rates of exchange.
Balance sheet items are translated into US dollars at period end exchange rates.
Exchange differences on the re-translation are taken to a separate component of equity.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings financing those net investments are also dealt with in reserves.
All other exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement in the year in which they arise.
31 December Average 31 December Average 2005 2005 2004 2004 Kazakhstan tenge 133.77 132.88 129.96 135.95 Euro 0.84 0.80 0.74 0.80 UK pounds sterling 0.58 0.55 0.54 0.54 b Intangible assets i Goodwill On the acquisition of a subsidiary, or of an interest in a joint venture, associate, or joint arrangement, the purchase consideration is allocated to the assets and liabilities on the basis of their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Those mineral reserves and resources that are able to be reliably valued are recognised in the assessment of fair values on acquisition.
Other potential reserves, resources and mineral rights for which, in the Directors opinion, values cannot be reliably determined, are not recognised.
When the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair value attributable to the Groups share of the identifiable net assets the difference is treated as purchased goodwill.
Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised, rather it is tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units expected to benefit from the related business combination for the purpose of the impairment testing.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
ii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets, including mineral licences, which are acquired by the Group and which have finite useful lives, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition, subject to the constraint that, unless the asset has a readily ascertainable market value, the fair value is limited to an amount that does not create or increase any negative goodwill arising on the acquisition.
iii Amortisation Intangible assets, other than goodwill, primarily comprise mineral licence acquisition costs, which are amortised on a unit of production basis.
Amortisation for other intangible assets, which have expected useful lives of 3-10 years, is computed under the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
c Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
d Tangible assets i Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
The cost or deemed cost of property, plant and equipment hereafter referred to as cost at 1 January 2002, the date of Kazakhmys LLCs transition to IFRS, was determined by reference to its depreciated replacement cost at that date in accordance with IFRS 1.
The cost of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life.
Each items estimated useful life has due regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located.
Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset or on a unit of production basis depending on the type of asset.
Changes in estimates, which affect unit of production calculations, are accounted for prospectively.
Depreciation commences on the date of acquisition.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 72 Kazakhmys PLC Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2005 3.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued d Tangible assets continued i Property, plant and equipment continued The expected useful lives are as follows: Buildings 15-25 years Plant and equipment 4-25 years Fixtures and fittings 3-15 years ii Mineral properties and mine development costs Costs of acquiring mineral properties are capitalised on the balance sheet in the year in which they are incurred.
Costs associated with a start-up period for significant developments are capitalised during the commissioning period development expenditure where the asset is incapable of operating at normal levels without a commissioning period.
Mine development costs are, upon commencement of production, depreciated using a unit of production method based on the estimated economically recoverable reserves to which they relate.
iii Construction in progress Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment.
On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category.
The cost of a tangible fixed asset comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use.
Construction in progress is not depreciated.
iv Subsequent expenditure Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that is accounted for separately, is capitalised with the carrying amount of the component being written off.
Other subsequent expenditure is capitalised if future economic benefits will arise from the expenditure.
All other expenditure, including repairs and maintenance expenditure, is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
v Government grants Government grants are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be complied with.
When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income over the periods necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate.
Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is credited to the cost of the asset and is released to the income statement over the expected useful life in a consistent manner with the depreciation method of the relevant asset.
vi Leasing and hire purchase commitments Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased items, are capitalised at the commencement of the lease.
Plant and equipment acquired by way of finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The capital elements of future obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised lease assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
vii Mine stripping costs Mine stripping costs incurred in order to access the mineral-bearing ore deposits are deferred prior to the commencement of production.
Such costs are amortised over the remaining life of the mine on a unit of production basis.
The cost of removal of the waste material during a mines production phase is deferred, where appropriate.
The deferral of these costs, and subsequent charges in the income statement, are determined in order to evenly match the stripping costs against the quantities of ore mined in each period.
Where the extraction of the ore is expected to be evenly distributed, or where the impact of deferral is not material, the costs of removal are expensed as incurred.
e Exploration and evaluation expenditure Exploration and evaluation expenditure for each area of interest, other than that acquired from the purchase of another mining company, is carried forward as an asset provided that one of the following conditions is met: Such costs are expected to be recouped through successful exploration and development of the area of interest or, alternatively, by its sale.
Exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not yet reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and significant operations in relation to the area are continuing.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Kazakhmys PLC 73 3.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued e Exploration and evaluation expenditure continued Exploration expenditure which fails to meet at least one of the conditions outlined above is written off.
Administrative and general expenses relating to exploration and evaluation activities are expensed as incurred.
The significant portion of exploration and evaluation expenditure relates to mineral licences, which are classified and accounted for as intangible assets.
Identifiable exploration and evaluation assets acquired are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition from another mining company.
Exploration assets are reassessed on a regular basis and these costs are carried forward provided that at least one of the conditions outlined above is met.
Exploration and evaluation assets attributable to producing interests are amortised on a unit of production basis.
f Impairment The carrying amounts of non-current assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether the carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount.
Such review is undertaken on an asset by asset basis, except where such assets do not generate cash flows independent of other assets, in which case the review is undertaken at the cash generating unit level.
If the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to reflect the asset at the lower amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
i Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independent of those from other assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The Groups cash-generating units are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
ii Reversals of impairment An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
g Inventories Raw materials and consumables are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a first-in first-out FIFO basis.
Cost includes all costs incurred in the normal course of business in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
Cost for raw materials and consumables is purchase price and for work in progress and finished goods is the cost of production, including the appropriate proportion of depreciation and overheads.
The cost of work in progress and finished goods is based on the weighted average cost method.
In the case of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
h Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are carried at original invoice price which is the fair value of the consideration receivable less provision made for impairment of these receivables.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the original carrying amount and the recoverable amount, being the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest for similar borrowers.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits held on call or with maturities less than three months and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts.
j Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 74 Kazakhmys PLC Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2005 3.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued k Employee benefits i Long-term employee benefits The Group provides long-term employee benefits to employees before, on and after retirement, in accordance with a labour union agreement.
Such benefits are valued consistently with an unfunded defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
The agreement provides for one-time retirement grants, financial aid, dental care, medical benefits, sanatorium visits, annual financial support to pensioners, free tickets for city buses, privilege tickets for shuttle buses and funeral aid.
The agreement in Germany provides for part-time work for older employees.
There are no employee benefits provided in the United Kingdom.
The future benefit that employees have earned is discounted to determine the present value.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups benefit obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary.
The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses falling outside a corridor of the greater of 10% of the benefit obligation or 10% of the assets, amortised over the expected average future working lifetime of employees in the arrangements.
The expense in relation to these benefits is charged to the income statement so as to match the cost of providing these benefits to the period of service of the employees.
ii Trust activities Assets held in trust or in a fiduciary capacity are not treated as assets of the Group and, accordingly, are not included in the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions entered into with these trust activities are expensed in the consolidated financial statements.
iii Social programmes The Group is obliged to contribute towards social programmes for the benefit of the local community at large.
The Groups contributions towards these programmes are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
l Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
i Site restoration costs Site restoration provisions are made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure and restoration, and for environmental rehabilitation costs which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs.
The provision is discounted where material and the unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs.
At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future benefit and depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates.
The provision is reviewed on an annual basis for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations.
ii Restructuring A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or been announced publicly.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
iii Other Other provisions are accounted for when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation for which it is probable there will be an outflow of resources, for which the amount can be reliably estimated.
m Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue associated with the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has passed to the customer.
Approximately 50% of sales agreements provide for provisional pricing of sales in the month of sale with final pricing settlement based on average LME copper price for the month following the sale.
Sales which remain open to final pricing at year end are valued at provisional prices.
Sales are subsequently adjusted for the final pricing settlement when closed out in the following year.
Revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes.
Mining royalties are included within cost of sales.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Kazakhmys PLC 75 3.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued n Finance income Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and foreign exchange gains.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, calculated in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
o Finance costs Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, the accumulation of interest on provisions and foreign exchange losses.
All interest and other costs incurred in connection with borrowings are expensed as incurred as part of finance costs.
p Income tax Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Excess profits tax is treated as income tax and forms part of the income tax expense.
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes, and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: Goodwill amortisation or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred excess profits tax is calculated with respect to temporary differences in respect of assets allocated to contracts for subsoil use at the expected rate of excess profits tax to be paid under the contract.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
q Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
r Financial instruments i Recognition The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
ii Measurement Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at cost, which is the fair value of consideration given or received, respectively, including, or net of, any transaction costs incurred.
Any gain or loss at initial recognition is recognised in the current periods income statement.
In determining estimated fair value, investments are valued at quoted bid prices.
When quoted prices on an active market are not available, fair value is determined by reference to price quotations for similar instruments traded.
The Group classifies investments depending upon the intent of management at the time of the purchase.
Investments with fixed maturities and fixed or determinable payments that management has both the positive intent, and the ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 76 Kazakhmys PLC Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2005 3.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued r Financial instruments continued ii Measurement continued Loans and receivables are loans and receivables created by the Group providing money to a debtor.
Loans and receivables comprise loans and advances other than purchased loans.
Held-to-maturity investments and originated loans and receivables are initially recognised in accordance with the policy stated above and subsequently re-measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Allowance for impairment is estimated on a case-by-case basis.
Commodity futures are initially recognised at fair value.
Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement in the period in which they occur.
iii Derecognition Held-to-maturity instruments and originated loans and receivables are derecognised on the date they are transferred by the Group.
Segment information A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services business segment, or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment geographical segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
Segment information is presented in respect of the Groups business and geographical segments.
From 1 January 2005, the primary format, business segments, is based on the Groups management and internal reporting structure following the acquisition by the Group of MKM.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items comprise mainly income taxes payable, deferred taxes and dividends payable receivable.
The Groups principal operations are based in Kazakhstan, with MKM, a subsidiary of Kazakhmys LLC, being based in Germany.
The Groups activities principally relate to: Kazakh mining operations which involve the production and sale of: Copper cathodes and copper rod Zinc and zinc concentrate Gold and silver Other by-product metals lead, rhenium and selenium.
Segmental information is also provided in respect of revenues, by destination and by product.
Segmental information relating to employees is provided in note 7.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Kazakhmys PLC 77 4.
Segment information continued a Business segments The Kazakh Mining operations, which involve the processing and sale of copper and other metals, are managed as one business segment.
The products are subject to the same risks and returns, exhibit similar long-term financial performance and are sold through the same distribution channels.
The Group mines all the copper ore it processes and produces substantially all the copper concentrate it processes.
The Group has a number of activities that exist solely to support the mining operations including power generation, coal mining and transportation.
These other activities generate less than 10% of total revenues both external and internal and the related assets are less than 10% of total assets.
For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, one business segment is therefore identified as a reportable segment in respect of the year ended 31 December 2004.
From 1 January 2005, the UK operation has primarily purchased its products from the Kazakh Mining business and applies an appropriate mark-up prior to onward sale to third party customers.
It is therefore regarded as a sales function on behalf of the Kazakh Mining business and is not considered a distinct business segment.
The price at which sales are made to the Company by Kazakhmys LLC is the prevailing price of commodities as determined by the LME.
At the end of 2004, the Group acquired MKM, which operates from Germany, where it manufactures copper and copper alloy semi-finished products.
MKM faces different risks to the Groups Kazakh Mining operations and, therefore, from 1 January 2005 the Group operated two distinct business segments.
Segmental information in respect of these two business segments for the years ended 31 December 2005 and 2004 is presented below.

Income tax continued c Unrecognised deferred tax assets continued Details of the Groups tax losses arising in the three jurisdictions in which it operates are as follows: Kazakhstan Deferred excess profits tax liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences relating to property, plant and equipment which can be allocated to contracts for subsoil use.
Deferred tax assets in respect of excess profits tax have not been recognised because the future tax rate cannot be sufficiently reliably estimated for this purpose.
Germany MKM has at 31 December 2005 corporate income tax losses that can be carried forward and used against future taxable profits, subject to restrictions set out under German tax legislation.
There is no time restriction over the utilisation of tax losses.
Due to the past history of tax losses, there is insufficient certainty that a taxable profit will arise against which the losses can be offset.
For these reasons no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Refer to note 33 c for further details.
United Kingdom The payment of the dividend from Kazakhmys LLC to the Company has created excess foreign tax credits of $16.9 million 2004: $nil which have arisen due to the higher effective tax rate in Kazakhstan compared to the UK.
These excess foreign tax credits do not expire.
d Unrecognised deferred tax liability The Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of the distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The gross temporary differences in respect of the undistributed reserves of Kazakhmys LLC, as shown in its statutory accounts prepared in accordance with Kazakhstan accounting standards, are as follows: 2005 2004 $000 $000 Undistributed reserves of Kazakhmys LLC 1,248,910 979,075 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 94 Kazakhmys PLC Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2005 12.
Earnings per share The earnings per share EPS calculation has assumed that the number of ordinary shares issued pursuant to share exchange agreements in relation to the acquisition of Kazakhmys LLC have been in issue throughout the two year period ended 31 December 2005 consistent with the pooling of interests method used to account for combinations of businesses under common control.
The EPS calculation has also assumed that the share split that occurred on 26 September 2005, in which the Companys share capital was redenominated into ordinary shares of 20 pence each, was in effect for all prior periods.
The Directors believe that this basis for the EPS calculation provides a more relevant performance measure of the Group than using an EPS calculation which reflected shares issued based on the actual date of issue.
Basic and diluted EPS Basic EPS is calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares of 20 pence each outstanding during the year.
The Company has no dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The following reflects the income and share data used in the EPS computations: 2005 2004 $000 $000 Net profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company 538,770 429,806 2005 2004 No.
Number of shares Weighted average number of ordinary shares of 20 pence each for EPS calculation 418,105,627 403,725,750 EPS basic and diluted $1.29 $1.06 EPS based on Underlying Profit The Groups Underlying Profit is the profit for the year after adding back items which are non-recurring or variable in nature and which do not impact the underlying trading performance of the business and their resultant tax and minority interest effects, as shown in the table below.
EPS based on Underlying Profit is calculated by dividing Underlying Profit by the number of ordinary shares of 20 pence each outstanding during the year.
The Directors believe EPS based on Underlying Profit provides a more consistent measure for comparing the underlying trading performance of the Group between 2004 and 2005.
The following shows the reconciliation of Underlying Profit from the reported profit and the share data used in the computations for EPS based on Underlying Profit: 2005 2004 $000 $000 Net profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company 538,770 429,806 Special items: Recognition of negative goodwill 111,327 Write-off of property, plant and equipment 6,796 30,307 Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment 4,550 25,881 Tax effect of non-recurring items 501 2,899 Minority interest effect of non-recurring items 150 1,434 Underlying Profit 549,765 376,132 2005 2004 No.

Accordingly, as the share exchange agreement was not effective until 23 November 2004, these dividends were paid directly to Kazakhmys LLCs former shareholders, rather than to the Company.
The dividends are shown in the consolidated financial statements as cash outflows for the Group, consistent with the pooling of interests method of accounting.

Goodwill acquired in the year ended 31 December 2004 relates to the transfer of Apros business to the Company on 31 December 2004 and represented the difference between the consideration of $1.0 million payable over the fair value of assets acquired.
The goodwill was written off during the year as no further benefit is expected to accrue to the Group after 31 December 2005 resulting from the transfer of Apros business.

Property, plant, and equipment continued Deemed cost of assets within Kazakhmys LLC For the purpose of the transition to IFRS in 2002, the Directors commissioned Rice Group Central Asia LLP, a company holding a state licence to conduct valuations, to carry out an independent appraisal of property, plant and equipment as of 1 January 2002 to determine their deemed cost at that date.
The deemed cost of property, plant and equipment as of 1 January 2002 was determined primarily with reference to depreciated replacement cost.
The Directors believe that the deemed cost reflected the economic conditions of the Groups property, plant and equipment at that time.
Fully depreciated assets within Kazakhmys LLC At 31 December 2005, property, plant and equipment with a cost of $83.6 million was fully depreciated 2004: $53.8 million.

The carrying value of fixed assets under the leases was $7.0 million as at 31 December 2005 2004: $10.3 million.
The residual term of the leases is an average of one year, and the remaining economic useful life of the assets under lease is eight years.
The total value of the minimum leasing payments was $0.3 million as at 31 December 2005 2004: $1.0 million.
For the year ended 31 December 2005, the average effective borrowing rate was 5.5% 2004: 5.5%.

Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Kazakhmys PLC 103 24.
Share capital and reserves a Authorised and allotted share capital As described in note 2 a, a pooling of interests method of accounting has been applied in the presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
This method presents the results of the Group as if the Company had always been the parent company.
This has the effect that, despite the Company not being incorporated until 15 July 2004, the ordinary share capital shown throughout the period of the consolidated financial statements is that of the Company resulting from the share exchange with the previous shareholders of Kazakhmys LLC.
In the statutory accounts of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2004, the share capital as at 1 January 2004, resulting from the adoption of the pooling of interests method of accounting, was estimated based on the number of share swaps expected to be undertaken pursuant to share exchange agreements see note 2 a.
As the number of share swaps undertaken was finalised during 2005, the share capital as at 1 January 2004 has been restated to take account of those additional shares issued.
On 23 September 2005, a share split took place in which each ordinary share of 5 each was sub-divided into 25 ordinary shares of 20 pence each.

The major facilities as at 31 December 2005 and 2004 are: a ABN facility On 2 April 2004 amended 28 November 2005, Kazakhmys LLC entered into a loan facility agreement with CJSC ABN AMRO Bank Kazakhstan ABN under which ABN granted to Kazakhmys LLC a revolving credit facility of up to $20.0 million until February 2007.

The interest payable is LIBOR 1.75%.
The loan is secured by a pledge over certain of Kazakhmys LLCs assets as agreed with Citibank from time to time.
c Dresden Bank In December 2005, MKM entered into a loan credit agreement with Dresden Bank for a short-term loan of 6.1 million for working capital purposes.
The interest payable is EURIBOR 1.35%.

The Company subsequently borrowed $100.0 million from Apro on the same terms and, in turn, lent these borrowings to Kazakhmys LLC.
This Citibank Loan was novated to the Company on 26 January 2005 at which point the loan between the Company and Apro was considered settled.
During the period when the loan was extended to the Company, it was secured on Kazakhmys LLCs production of copper cathodes.
The loan was fully repaid on 28 November 2005. e Redeemable preference shares On 22 October 2004, 50,000 redeemable preference shares of 1 each were allotted by the Company and issued to Apro at par on the condition that they were to be redeemed by the Company no later than 31 December 2005.

These shares were redeemed on 20 September 2005, out of distributable profits of the Company in preparation for the Companys Listing.
f Undrawn facilities The Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities in place: 2005 2004 $000 $000 Credit lines 147,930 138,042 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 106 Kazakhmys PLC Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2005 26.
Employee benefits The following tables summarise the components of net benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet for the respective plans: 31 December 31 December 2005 2004 $000 $000 Kazakhstan post-retirement benefits 23,054 22,454 Germany part-time contracts 5,604 5,862 Recognised liability for employee benefit obligations 28,658 28,316 Kazakhstan 2005 2004 $000 $000 Net liability at 1 January 22,454 19,309 Employers share of current service cost 346 312 Interest cost on benefit obligation 1,844 1,617 Benefits provided to employees 948 804 Net exchange adjustment 642 2,020 Net liability at 31 December 23,054 22,454 Germany 2005 2004 $000 $000 Net liability at 1 January 5,862 Acquisition 5,862 Employers share of current service cost 2,177 Interest cost on benefit obligation 172 Benefits provided to employees 1,718 Net exchange adjustment 889 Net liability at 31 December 5,604 5,862 Kazakhstan The Group provides post-retirement benefits in Kazakhstan which are unfunded.
The actuarial losses on prior period service costs which existed as at 31 December 2005 amounted to $4.0 million 2004: $nil.
Key assumptions adopted in calculating the employee benefit liabilities and associated charges, as measured in KZT, for the presented periods are as follows: 2005 2004 % per annum % per annum Discount rate 7.5% 8.5% Expected rate of annual material assistance increases 5.0% 5.0% Expected rate of annual railway ticket price increases 5.0% 5.0% Expected rate of increase in medical costs 7.5% 7.5% The Group continues to pay the non-monetary benefits described in note 7.
Germany In Germany, MKM has obligations arising from part-time contracts for older employees that have been collectively agreed with the employees trade union.
The amount of these obligations has been calculated using a 3.0% discount rate.
Non-current investments amounting to $3.1 million 2004: $3.4 million have been set aside to fund MKMs obligations relating to part-time contracts.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Kazakhmys PLC 107 27.
The provision represents the discounted values of the estimated costs to decommission and reclaim the mines at the dates of depletion of each of the deposits.
The present value of the provision has been calculated using a discount rate of 8% per year.
The liability becomes payable at the end of the useful life of each mine which ranges from one to 43 years.
Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives, and the levels of discount and inflation rates.
b Payments for licences In accordance with its contracts for subsoil uses the Group is liable to repay the costs of geological information provided by the Government of Kazakhstan for licensed deposits.
The total amount payable is discounted to its present value using a discount rate of 8%.
The uncertainties include estimating the amount of the payments and their timing.
The amounts are payable prior to 2025. c Restructuring The restructuring provision relates to the expected costs of restructuring in MKM.
The restructuring plan, which was drawn up by MKM management prior to the acquisition of MKM by Kazakhmys LLC, is in respect of the closure costs related to MKMs copper cathode production plant.
The main uncertainty in estimating these costs is the level of the actual costs to be incurred.
d Other Other provisions are recorded where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation and a future outflow of resources is considered probable.
Trade and other payables 31 December 31 December 2005 2004 $000 $000 Trade payables 86,488 82,117 Trade receivables received in advance 13,789 Amounts payable to related parties see note 34 3,621 21,239 Other taxes payable 5,152 4,552 Salaries and related payables 15,938 17,631 Other payables and accrued expenses 33,704 19,068 158,692 144,607 Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are normally settled on 30-40 day terms.
Other taxes payable comprise sales tax, property tax and road tax and are remitted to the appropriate tax authority on a quarterly basis.
Other payables are non-interest bearing and have an average term of 30 days.

Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking MKM On 15 December 2004, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary shares of MKM, an unlisted company based in Germany.
MKM produces and sells copper and copper alloy semi-finished products worldwide for various applications and industries.
Under an agreement with the previous owners, MKM was sold to the Group for a nominal consideration of 4.00 for the shares, certain shareholder loans, certain intellectual property, three MKM trading companies SARL Lamitref France, Lamitref UK Ltd and Lamitref Italia Srl and the payment of certain taxes in connection with the acquisition.
As the transaction was conducted in December 2004 there was no material impact of acquiring MKM on the financial results of the Group in 2004.
The acquisition gave rise to fair value adjustments totalling a $77.0 million decrease to net assets resulting in net assets recognised on acquisition of $114.7 million before accounting for negative goodwill of $111.3 million.
Under an agreement with the previous owners, the Group is obliged to maintain the current number of employees until 31 December 2006.
The negative goodwill that arose on the acquisition is as a result of the consideration as compared to the fair value of the net assets acquired.
The level of the consideration takes account of the commitments the Group has given in respect of future investment and employment levels.
Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and current investments.
The Groups accounting policies with regard to financial instruments are detailed in note 3.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The numerical disclosures in this note deal with financial assets and liabilities as defined in IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation.
a Derivatives, financial instruments and risk management In general, the Group does not use derivative instruments and financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates, interest rates and commodity prices, with the exception of MKM, where limited commodity futures are used to manage its exposure to copper prices.
b Foreign currency risk The Group has translational currency exposures.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating company in currencies other than that companys functional currency.
The functional currency of Kazakhmys LLC is the Kazakhstan tenge, with MKM having a euro functional currency and the Company having a US dollar functional currency.
The currencies giving rise to this foreign currency risk are primarily the US dollar for revenues, certain bank deposits, trade receivables, certain trade payables and loans of Kazakhmys LLC, and the US dollar in respect of certain revenues, and trade receivables and payables of MKM.
The Group does not enter into hedging positions in respect of its exposure to foreign currency risk.
The analysis of the net monetary assets and liabilities indicates the Groups exposure to currencies other than the functional currency of a company.
These exposures represent the transactional exposures that may give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Financial risk management objectives and policies continued c Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in the price of copper, which is quoted in US dollars on the international markets.
The Group has prepared a business plan including sensitivity analyses in respect of various levels of copper prices in the future.
The Group with the exception of MKM does not hedge its exposure to the risk of fluctuations in the price of copper and other mineral commodities.
MKM uses natural hedging arising on back-to-back purchase and supply contracts to manage its exposure to changes in the price of copper.
In those limited cases where a natural hedge is not possible, MKM uses commodity futures to manage its exposure to changes in the price of copper.
d Credit risk The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
It is the Groups policy that credit evaluations are performed on all customers, who wish to trade on credit terms whereby they require credit over a certain amount.
The Group regularly monitors its exposure to bad debts in order to minimise this exposure.
Credit risk relating to the Groups other financial assets, comprising principally current investments and cash and cash equivalents, arises from the potential default of counterparties.
Management regularly monitors the financial strength of counterparties through their knowledge of local market conditions.
The maximum exposure with respect to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset on the balance sheet.
As at 31 December 2004, there was a significant concentration of credit risk in respect of amounts receivable from related parties see note 34.
After the transfer of Apros business to the Company on 31 December 2004, credit risk associated with amounts receivable from related parties is not considered significant.
As at 31 December 2005, three customers accounted for 97% of the trade and other receivables balance of the Kazakh Mining business.
By 29 March 2006, 98% of year-end balances due from these customers had been received in full.
e Price risk The Group holds German securities on behalf of employees in order to fund its obligations arising from part time contracts for older employees note 26.
These securities amounted to $3.1 million as at 31 December 2005 2004: $3.4 million.
The Group is therefore exposed to fluctuations in the market price of these securities.
f Liquidity risk The Group maintains a balance between availability of funding and maximising investment return on its liquid resources through the use of bank term deposits of varying maturities and short-term credit facilities.
Management regularly reviews the funding requirements of the Group in selecting appropriate maturities for its bank term deposits.
In the event that bank term deposits in Kazakhstan need to be liquidated at short notice in advance of their contracted maturity date, the terms of these investments permit their immediate conversion to cash but with forfeiture of interest accrued to the date of liquidation.
g Interest rate risk The Group has financial assets and liabilities, which are exposed to interest rate risk.
Changes in interest rates impact primarily loans and borrowings by changing either their fair value fixed rate debt or their future cash flows variable rate debt.
The Group does not have a formal policy of determining how much of the Groups exposure should be at fixed or at variable rates and the Group does not use hedging instruments to minimise the exposure.
However, at the time of taking new loans or borrowings management uses its judgement to decide whether it believes that a fixed or variable rate borrowing would be more favourable to the Group over the expected period until maturity.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the tables on the opposite page are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.

In other cases fair value has been determined as of the balance sheet date by discounting the estimated future cash flows using market interest rates for similar instruments.
As a result of this exercise the Directors have determined that the fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, comprising cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, restricted cash, current and non-current investments, trade payables and borrowings, approximates to the carrying amounts.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Kazakhmys PLC 113 33.
Commitments and contingencies a Legal claims In the ordinary course of business, the Group is subject to legal actions and complaints.
The Directors believe that the ultimate liability, if any, arising from such actions or complaints will not have a materially adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Group.
As of 31 December 2005 the Group was not involved in any significant legal proceedings, including arbitration.
b Taxation contingencies i Inherent uncertainties in interpreting tax legislation The Group is subject to uncertainties relating to the determination of its tax liabilities for each reporting period.
As the tax system and tax legislation in Kazakhstan have been in force for only a relatively short time, those uncertainties are substantially greater than typically found in countries with more developed tax systems.
Applicable taxes include value added tax, corporate income tax and excess profits tax.
Laws relating to applicable taxes are not clearly determinable and legislation is evolving and is subject to different and changing interpretations, as well as inconsistent enforcement.
The uncertainty of application and the evolution of tax laws create a risk of additional tax payments having to be made by the Group, which could have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position and results of operations.
In relation to excess profits tax, the tax law gives no explicit guidance on how the tax base should be determined for individual subsurface use contracts relevant to certain members of the Group.
Prior to 2002 it was not clear from the contracts themselves as to how profitability should be allocated to the Groups mining operations.
In the event of a successful challenge by the tax authorities, the Group may be liable for additional payments of excess profits tax.
Depending on the interpretation adopted and the amounts, if any, that are involved, this could have a significant adverse impact on the Groups financial position and on its profit for a reporting period.
Under such circumstances, there would also be a consequential significant adverse impact on all subsequent periods due to the cumulative nature of the excess profits tax calculations.
ii Status of tax audits In 2004 the Kazakh tax authorities conducted a tax audit on Kazakhmys LLC for the periods 1998 to 2002.
For all taxes, the fact that the tax authorities have conducted an audit of a particular period does not prevent them from revisiting that period and raising an additional assessment.
In addition, Kazakhstans tax system does not have the concept of the tax authorities giving legally binding rulings on tax issues that are put to them.
iii Period for additional tax assessments The tax authorities are able to raise additional tax assessments for five years after the end of the relevant tax period.
iv Penalties charges Tax regulation and compliance is subject to review and investigation by a number of levels of the tax authorities and the Courts who may impose severe fines, penalties and interest charges.
v Possible additional tax liabilities The Directors believe that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws and any contractual terms entered into that relate to tax which affect its operations and that, consequently, no additional tax liabilities will arise.
However, due to the reasons set out above, the risk remains that the relevant government authorities may take a differing position with regard to the interpretation of contractual provisions or tax law.
The resulting effect of this matter is that significant additional tax liabilities may arise.
However, due to the range of uncertainties described above in assessing any potential additional tax liabilities, it is not practicable for the Directors to estimate the financial effect in terms of the amount of additional tax liabilities, if any, together with any associated penalties and charges for which the Group may be liable.
c German taxation contingencies i Status of tax audits The German tax authorities have conducted a tax audit of MKM for 1998, however, the years from 1999 to 2005 remain open for inspection.
Consequently, the tax figures recorded in the financial statements for these years may be subject to change.
ii Payments of future utilised tax losses In accordance with the privatisation agreement between the successor body of the former state-controlled shareholder in MKM, BMBG  Berlin GmbH BMGB and Lamitref Holding B. V. dated 18 December 1995, to the extent that MKM utilises tax losses against taxable income, it is required to make certain agreed upon payments to BMGB.
The maximum payment that would be payable to BMGB is $115.5 million.
As MKM has reported tax losses in recent years, no payment to BMGB has been necessary to date.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the tax losses at MKM refer to note 11 and consequently, no corresponding liability in respect of payments to BMGB has been recognised.
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 114 Kazakhmys PLC Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 December 2005 33.
Commitments and contingencies continued d Insurance The insurance industry in Kazakhstan is in a developing state and many forms of insurance protection common in other parts of the world are not yet generally available.
The Group does not have full coverage for its plant facilities, business interruption, or third party liability in respect of property or environmental damage arising from accidents on Group property or relating to Group operations.
Until the Group obtains full third party insurance coverage, there is a risk that the loss or destruction of certain assets could have a material adverse effect on the Groups operations and financial position.
e Environmental contingencies Environmental regulations in Kazakhstan are continually evolving.
The outcome of the environmental regulations under proposed or any future environmental legislation cannot be estimated at present.
As obligations are determined, they will be provided for in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
The Directors believe that there are no significant liabilities under current legislation not accrued for in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The provision that has been made for costs associated with restoration and abandonment of mine sites upon depletion of deposits see note 27, is based upon the estimation of Kazakhmys LLCs specialists.
Where events occur that change the level of estimated future costs for these activities, the provision will be adjusted accordingly.
f Use of subsoil rights In Kazakhstan, all subsoil reserves belong to the State, with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources the Ministry granting exploration and production rights to third party bodies.
Subsoil rights are not granted in perpetuity, and any renewal must be agreed before the expiration of the relevant contract or licence.
These rights may be terminated by the Ministry if the Group does not satisfy its contractual obligations.
Expenditure commitments under these subsoil agreements are shown below.
The current subsoil rights will expire at varying dates up to 2025.
Expenditure commitments under these subsoil agreements are shown below see Other commitments.
g Obligations to pension fund beneficiaries The pension scheme is run by CJSC ABN Amro Bank Kazakhstan, and is termed the Accumulating Pension Funds of Kazakhmys Corporation LLC the Fund.
The Fund is a corporate accumulative pension fund established under the laws of Kazakhstan.
Certain of Kazakhmys LLCs employees and former employees are beneficiaries, and are entitled to an amount comprising the indexed value of their contributions.
Under Kazakhstan law, the Fund calculates the benefits of its members on an annual basis.
Kazakhmys LLC does not make any contributions to the Fund on behalf of its employees.
The Funds rules set out that the payment obligation to Fund beneficiaries is based on the nominal value of contributions, indexed in accordance with a formula set out in the Funds rules.
In the event that the assets of the Fund are insufficient to cover the payment obligations to the beneficiaries, the voting shareholders of the Fund including Kazakhmys LLC are jointly liable for the shortfall.
The last valuation as at 31 December 2005 showed the Funds payment obligations were $102.4 million 2004: $82.0 million, and the fair market value of the Funds assets amounted to $119.6 million 2004: $97.0 million.
h Commitments in respect of the acquisition of MKM In the context of its acquisition of MKM in December 2004, the Group is committed to invest approximately $43.0 million in capital expenditure by 31 December 2008, inject working capital of $37.0 million and ensure MKM employs at least 1,006 employees up to 31 December 2006. i Other commitments The table below sets out the Groups expenditure commitments with their respective maturity profiles as at 31 December 2005: Less than One to Three to More than one year three years five years five years Total $000 $000 $000 $000 $000 Training expenditure contracted 592 1,219 1,209 5,296 8,316 Capital expenditure contracted 117,010 137,272 94,075 962,676 1,311,033 Purchase commitments 197,650 2,484 862 431 201,427 315,252 140,975 96,146 968,403 1,520,776 i Training expenditure contracted The Group has obligations under all of its subsoil contracts in Kazakhstan to invest in training the local Kazakh workforce.
In about half of its contracts and licences, minimal obligations have been agreed as part of the subsoil contract, and are reflected in the table above.
In the other contracts, these training obligations are calculated as a function of the revenues or expenses associated with such contracts.
In such instances, this amount is generally not less than either 0.1% of the revenues, operational expenses or extraction expenses associated with the relevant contract.

i Apro Limited Apro In 2002, the Group entered into an exclusive purchasing agreement with Samsung Corporation a major shareholder of Kazakhmys LLC prior to 31 December 2003 and Harper Finance Limited a company controlled by Messrs Kim and Novachuk, Directors of the Company collectively referred to as the Consortium, providing it with the right to buy all of Kazakhmys LLCs products.
The Consortium appointed Apro a company controlled by Mr Cha, a Director of the Company to sell Kazakhmys LLCs exported products.
Under this arrangement Apro purchased Kazakhmys LLCs products as principal and sold them on to end customers.
Under the purchasing agreement, Apro purchased products from the Group at a discount to the prevailing LME price, and below the price at which Apro sold the products to end customers.
The discount reflected the fact that the significant commercial and credit risks were borne by Apro and the Consortium, rather than by Kazakhmys LLC.
Out of the difference between the purchase and sales prices, Apro retained a fee based on a percentage of sales revenue.
The balance was paid to the Consortium.
The exclusive purchasing agreement ceased in December 2004 and the Company acquired certain assets from Apro on 31 December 2004.
Sales to Apro accounted for the significant proportion of Group revenues in the year ended 31 December 2004.
Revenues in the year ended 31 December 2004 also included a sales service agreement fee payable to the Company by Apro of $13.4 million the outstanding balance of $10.3 million at 31 December 2004 was settled on 9 March 2005.
Balances due from Apro in respect of these trading arrangements are included within trade receivables as at 31 December 2004.

Under IFRS, dividends are only recognised as income in a financial year if they are declared and approved by the shareholders of Kazakhmys LLC in general meeting prior to the balance sheet date.
The effect of this difference has resulted in Kazakhmys LLCs final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2004 of $103.4 million, net of withholding tax suffered by the Company, which was approved by the shareholders of Kazakhmys LLC in its general meeting held on 23 May 2005, being recognised as income by the Company during the year ended 31 December 2005 under IFRS.

ii Redeemable preference shares The redeemable preference shares of $92,000 issued by the Company on 22 October 2004 were previously recorded within issued share capital under UK GAAP.
These shares are classified as borrowings under IFRS.
The effect of this difference has been to decrease equity and increase borrowings by the same amount.
iii Investments and capital reserve Under IFRS, shares issued pursuant to share-for-share exchange agreements are required to be recorded at fair value, with the difference between par value and the fair value recorded within a capital reserve.
d Reconciliation of cash flow statement for year ended 31 December 2004 There are no material differences other than changes in classification between the cash flow statement prepared under IFRS and that prepared under UK GAAP.
