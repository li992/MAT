Vedanta Resources plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Prior Year Adjustment The accounting policies applied in preparing the financial information are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the Groups statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2004, with the exception of the Groups accounting policy in respect of employee trusts.
The Group has reviewed its accounting policy for employee trusts in light of UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts, which has been adopted for the first time this year.
As required by this abstract, own shares held by employee trusts have been reclassied from other investments and are now recorded as a reduction in shareholders funds.
This has the effect of increasing the Groups interest in Sterlite by virtue of the change in treatment for the Sterlite shares held by the SEWT.
This change has been accounted for as a prior year adjustment and previously reported gures have been restated accordingly.
The effect on the profit and loss account of adopting this policy is as follows: New Previous treatment treatment Difference Year ended 31 March 2004 $ million $ million $ million profit after tax 157.4 157.4 Equity minority interests 85.1 90.8 5.7 profit for the financial year 72.3 66.6 5.7 Dividends 15.8 15.8 Retained profit for the financial year 56.5 50.8 5.7 New Previous treatment treatment Difference Year ended 31 March 2005 $ million $ million $ million profit after tax 234.7 234.7 Equity minority interests 114.7 119.5 4.8 profit for the financial year 120.0 115.2 4.8 Dividends 48.9 48.9 Retained profit for the financial year 71.1 66.3 4.8 The adoption of this policy led to an increase in the net assets of the Group of $4.8 million at 31 March 2004 1 April 2003: $8.4 million.
Accounting Policies Basis of Preparation The consolidated financial information for the Group has been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
To provide information which is meaningful to the Companys shareholders, the Directors believe that it is necessary to prepare the accounts on the basis that the Group had existed throughout the period from 1 April 2003.
The Directors believe that this information reects the ongoing operations of the Group more clearly.
Vedanta and VRHLs combination with the Twin Star Holdings Group has been accounted for as a group reconstruction under the provisions of FRS 6 Mergers and Acquisitions and is presented as if the Company and VRHL had been the holding company and intermediate holding company, respectively, of the Twin Star Holdings Group for each year.
Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial information incorporates the Financial Statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries, being the companies that it controls.
This control is normally evidenced when the Group is able to govern a companys financial and operating policies so as to benefit from its activities or where the Group owns, either directly or indirectly, the majority of a companys equity voting rights.
The principal subsidiaries included in the consolidation are set out in note 42.
The abbreviations used throughout these Financial Statements, in respect of these subsidiaries, are detailed in note 42.
72 DELIVER Y AND GROWTH Vedanta Resources plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting Policies continued Acquisitions and Disposals The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are consolidated for the periods from, or to, the date on which control passed.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method.
Excess purchase consideration, being the difference between the fair value of the consideration given and the fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised as an asset on the balance sheet.
To the extent that such excess purchase consideration relates to the acquisition of mining properties and leases, that amount is capitalised within tangible xed assets as mining properties and leases.
Other excess purchase consideration relating to the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised as goodwill within intangible xed assets and is amortised over its estimated useful life up to a maximum of 20 years.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Goodwill relating to associates is included within the carrying value of the associate.
The unamortised balance is reviewed for impairment on a regular basis.
Negative goodwill is similarly included in the balance sheet and is credited to the profit and loss account in the periods in which the acquired non-monetary assets are recovered through depreciation or disposal.
Negative goodwill in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired is credited to the profit and loss account through amortisation over the periods expected to benefit.
Where it is not possible to complete the determination of fair values by the date on which the first postacquisition financial statements are approved, a provisional assessment of fair values is made and any adjustments required to those provisional fair values, and the corresponding adjustments to purchased goodwill, are incorporated in the financial statements for the first full financial year following the acquisition.
Investments in Associates In the consolidated Financial Statements, investments in associates, being investments over which the Group exercises significant inuence and normally owns between 20% and 50% of the voting equity, are accounted for using the equity method.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the Groups share of associates profits losses, whilst the Groups share of the net assets of the associates is shown in the consolidated balance sheet, based upon the most recent audited financial statements or unaudited interim financial information.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above.
Any unamortised balance of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in associates.
Other Investments Fixed asset investments, other than investments in subsidiaries and associates, are recorded at cost less provision for impairment.
Current asset investments primarily comprise bank term deposits, short term unit trusts, liquidity funds and xed and oating rate debt securities.
These are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Tangible Fixed Assets Mining Properties and Leases The costs of mining properties and leases, which include the costs of acquiring and developing mining properties and mineral rights, are capitalised as tangible xed assets in the year in which they are incurred.
When a decision is taken that a mining property is viable for commercial production, all further pre-production expenditure is capitalised until the mining property is capable of commercial production.
From that point, capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised on a unit of production basis over the total estimated remaining commercial reserves of each property or group of properties.
In circumstances where a property is abandoned, the cumulative capitalised costs relating to the property are written off in the period.
Commercial reserves are proved and probable reserves.
Changes in the commercial reserves affecting unit of production calculations are dealt with prospectively over the revised remaining reserves.
Other Tangible Fixed Assets The initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and nonrefundable purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to the working condition and location for its intended use.
Expenditure incurred after the xed assets have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance and overhaul costs, are normally charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which the costs are incurred.
DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 73 Vedanta Resources plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting Policies continued Assets in the Course of Construction Assets in the course of construction are capitalised in the capital work-in-progress account.
Upon completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of tangible xed assets.
Costs associated with the commissioning of an asset are capitalised where the asset is available for use but incapable of operating at normal levels until a period of commissioning has been completed.
Interest payable on borrowings and foreign exchange gains or losses from hedging activities related to construction or development projects are capitalised until substantially all of the activities that are necessary to bring the asset into productive use have been completed.
Depreciation Mining properties and other assets in the course of development or construction, and freehold land, are not depreciated.
Capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised once commercial production commences, as described in Tangible Fixed Assets Mining Properties and Leases.
Leasehold land and buildings are depreciated over the period of the lease.
Other buildings, plant and equipment, ofce equipment and xtures, and motor vehicles are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows: Buildings: Operations 30 years Administration 50 years Plant and equipment 10 20 years Ofce equipment and xtures 3 20 years Motor vehicles 9 11 years Impairment The carrying amounts of tangible xed assets, investments in associates, other investments and goodwill are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
If there are indicators of impairment, an assessment is made to determine whether the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
Whenever the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is charged to the profit and loss account.
For mining properties and leases, investments in associates, other investments and goodwill, the recoverable amount of an asset is determined on the basis of its value in use, being the present value of estimated future cash ows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life, discounted using a market-based, risk-adjusted, discount rate.
For other tangible xed assets, the recoverable amount of an asset is also considered on the basis of its net realisable value, where it is possible to assess the amount that could be obtained from the sale of an asset in an arms length transaction, less the cost of disposal.
Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if this is not possible, for the relevant cashgenerating unit.
Research and Exploration Expenditure Research and exploration expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred unless a decision is taken that a mining property becomes viable for commercial production.
Government Grants Government grants relating to tangible xed assets are treated as deferred income and released to the profit and loss account over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Other grants are credited to the profit and loss account as the related expenditure is incurred.
Stocks Stocks and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, less any provision for obsolescence.
Cost is determined on the following basis: raw materials including ore and concentrates and consumables are recorded at cost on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis, except for stores and spare parts which are carried at weighted average cost: coal and furnace oil used in the Aluminium Business, and metal and coke stocks are valued at weighted average cost: 74 DELIVER Y AND GROWTH Vedanta Resources plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting Policies continued Stocks continued nished products are valued at raw material cost plus costs of conversion, comprising labour costs and an attributable proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity: and by-products and scrap are valued at net realisable value.
Net realisable value is determined based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but have not reversed, at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial Statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the Financial Statements.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future has been entered into by the subsidiary or associate.
Pensions The Group operates a number of pension schemes, the assets of which are where funded held in separately administered funds.
The pension schemes are generally funded by payments from employees and the relevant Group companies, taking account of the recommendations of independent qualied actuaries.
For dened benefit schemes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benets is the estimated regular cost of providing the benets accrued in the year, adjusted to reect variations from that cost.
The regular cost is calculated so that it represents a substantially level percentage of current and future payroll.
Variations from regular cost are charged or credited to the profit and loss account as a constant percentage of payroll over the estimated average remaining working life of scheme members.
Differences between amounts charged to the profit and loss account and amounts funded are shown as either provisions or prepayments in the balance sheet.
For dened contribution schemes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benets is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Details of the Groups pension schemes are provided in note 29.
Employee Share Awards The estimated cost of employee share awards made by the Group is charged to the profit and loss account over the relevant performance period.
The estimated cost of awards is the market value of shares awarded or the intrinsic value of the awards being the difference between the exercise price of the award and the market price at the date of grant adjusted to reect any applicable performance conditions.
Provisions for Liabilities and Charges Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reect the current best estimate.
DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 75 Vedanta Resources plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting Policies continued Restoration, Rehabilitation and Environmental Costs An obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing production of a mine.
Costs arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to net present value, are provided for and capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises.
These costs are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision.
Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage which is caused on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at their net present values and charged to the profit and loss account as extraction progresses.
Where the costs of site restoration are not anticipated to be material, they are expensed as incurred.
Revenue Recognition Turnover represents the net invoice value of goods and services provided to third parties after deducting sales taxes and duties, and is recognised when all significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset sold are transferred.
Dividends are recognised when received.
Leases Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Foreign Currency Translation In the financial statements of individual group companies, transactions in currencies other than the local functional currency are translated into local currency at the exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction or, where forward exchange contracts are in place, at contractual rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into local currency at year end exchange rates, or at a contractual rate if applicable.
For the purposes of consolidation, the results of those entities for which the US dollar is not the reporting currency are translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange during the period.
The related balance sheets are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of such operations, and on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they hedge the Groups investment in such operations, are reported in the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account.
The principal exchange rates applied for the translation of the Groups financial information are set out below: As at Average As at $ Currency rates 31 March 2005 2004 2005 31 March 2004 Indian rupee INR 43.75 44.96 43.39 Euro 0.773 0.795 0.817 Australian dollar A$ 1.298 1.357 1.312 UK pounds sterling GBP 0.533 0.542 0.545 Capital Instruments Ordinary Shares are included in shareholders funds.
Other instruments are classied as liabilities if they contain an obligation to transfer economic benefit and, if not, they are included in shareholders funds.
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The finance cost recognised in the profit and loss account in respect of capital instruments, other than equity shares, is allocated to periods over the term of the instrument at a constant rate on the carrying value.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the period.
Convertible debt is reported as a liability unless conversion actually occurs.
No gain or loss is recognised on conversion.

Accounting Policies continued Derivative Financial Instruments In order to manage its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks, the Group enters into forward, option, swap contracts and other derivative financial instruments.
It is the Groups policy neither to hold nor issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Group uses the derivative financial instruments described above to manage exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks.
The Group considers that its derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting when the following criteria are met: the instrument is related to a foreign currency asset or liability that is probable and whose characteristics have been identied: it involves the same currency as the hedged item: and it reduces the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on operations.
Gains and losses arising on these contracts are deferred and are recognised in the profit and loss account, or as adjustments to the carrying amount of xed assets, only when the hedged transaction has itself been reected in the Financial Statements.
The rates applicable to such contracts are used to record the hedged item.
For an interest rate swap to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or a probable commitment and must change the nature of the interest rate by converting a xed rate to a variable rate or vice versa.
Interest differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable over the period of the contract.
Where commodity option contracts hedge anticipated future production or purchases, the option premiums paid are amortised over the life of the option and any realised gains and losses on exercise, in the period in which the hedged production is sold or commodity purchases are made, are recognised.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss is recognised at that time.

Overview of the Indian Direct Tax Regime The following is an overview of the salient features of the Indian direct tax regime relevant to the taxation of the Group: companies are subject to Indian income tax on a stand-alone basis.
There is no concept of tax consolidation or group relief in India: companies are charged tax on profits of assessment years which run from 1 April to 31 March.
For each assessment year, a companys profits will be subject to either regular income tax or Minimum Alternate Tax MAT, whichever is the greater: regular income tax is charged on book profits prepared under Indian GAAP adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Income Tax Act.
Typically the required adjustments generate significant timing differences in respect of the depreciation of xed assets, relief for provisions and accruals, the use of tax losses brought forward and pension costs.
Regular income tax is charged at 35% plus a surcharge.
The corporate tax rate has been revised to 30% plus a surcharge from the financial year 2005 06: MAT is charged on book profits prepared under Indian GAAP but typically with a limited number of adjustments.
MAT is charged at 7.5% plus a surcharge : there are various tax exemptions or tax holidays available to companies in India.
The most important to the Group are: i The industrial undertakings exemption.
profits of newly constructed industrial undertakings located in designated areas of India can benefit from a tax holiday.
A typical tax holiday would exempt 100% of the plants profits for five years, and 30% for the next five years, and ii The power plants exemption.
profits on newly constructed power plants can benefit from a tax holiday.
A typical holiday would exempt 100% of profits in ten consecutive years within the first 15 years of the power plants operation.
The start of the ten-year period can be chosen by a company: tax is payable in the financial year to which it relates: and tax returns submitted by companies are regularly subjected to a comprehensive review and aggressive challenge by the tax authorities.
There are appeals procedures available to both the tax authorities and taxpayers and it is not uncommon for significant or complex matters in dispute to remain outstanding for several years before they are nally resolved in the High Court or the Supreme Court.

Tax on profit on Ordinary Activities continued Overview of the Zambian Tax Regime copper and cobalt mining companies pay company tax at 25%: period for carry forward of tax losses for KCM and Smelterco is 20 years: companies are charged tax on profits of accounting years: income tax is charged on book profits prepared under IFRS adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1996 as amended: and tax returns are submitted on a self assessment basis to the Zambian Revenue Authority ZRA which will review the return if found inadequate.
Any disputes will be referred to the Revenue Appeals Tribunal and subsequently to the High Court or the Supreme Court.
b Factors Affecting Current Tax Charge for the Year Year ended Year ended 31 March 2005 31 March 2004 $ million $ million profit on ordinary activities before taxation 332.3 233.4 Tax on profit on ordinary activities at 36.59 % 2004: 35.88% 121.6 83.7 Effect of timing differences: Accelerated capital allowances 29.1 2.2 Utilisation of tax losses 10.6 3.9 Other short term timing differences 12.2 1.0 Permanent differences: Disallowable expenses 23.0 18.0 Non-taxable income 6.5 0.7 Tax holiday and similar exemptions 17.3 18.0 Impact of tax rate differences 7.7 2.9 Dividend distribution tax 3.0 Minimum Alternate Tax 1.1 0.7 Adjustments in respect of prior years 0.1 4.9 Current tax charge for the year 65.4 68.8 The majority of the Groups profits are earned and taxed in India and in Zambia.
During the period the effective tax rate has been signicantly less than the applicable Indian corporate rate of income tax.
This is primarily as a result of the significant tax exemptions industrial undertakings and tax holidays which have been available to shelter profits of Sterlite and HZL from regular income tax.
The statutory tax rate in Zambia applicable to KCM is 25%, which also has a reducing impact on the effective tax rate.
A further reduction in the corporate tax rate from the financial year 2005 06 has reduced the overall effective tax rate due to its impact on deferred tax.
c Factors that may Affect Future Tax Charges The effective tax rate of the Group in future periods is likely to be inuenced most signicantly by the following factors: the availability of exemptions and tax holidays to shelter profits from regular Indian income tax: the potential utilisation of accumulated tax losses of CMT, IFL, VRHL and the Company, the potential benefit of which has not been fully recognised as a deferred tax asset: and incremental tax costs, if any, of distributing earnings to shareholders through the Group structure.

Acquisitions and Disposals a Konkola Copper Mines PLC On 5 November 2004, the Group completed the acquisition of a 51% controlling interest in KCM, a company incorporated in the Republic of Zambia, for a total cash consideration of $49.2 million including acquisition expenses of $1.0 million.
KCMs principal activities comprise copper mining and smelting, and its operations are located in the Republic of Zambia.
The Group subscribed for $25.0 million of new ordinary shares in KCM, representing 51% of the enlarged issued share capital of KCM.
Additionally, the Group agreed to pay $23.2 million to ZCI, a minority shareholder in KCM, comprising an initial payment of $2.3 million at the date of acquisition, with the remaining $20.9 million payable in equal instalments over four years from 31 December 2005.
As required under UK GAAP, the deferred consideration of $20.9 million has been discounted to arrive at a net present value of $17.8 million, thereby resulting in a consideration of $46.1 million for the purposes of the goodwill determination.

The principal fair value adjustments are as follows: write off of secondary development expenditure which had been capitalised by KCM, whereas Vedantas accounting policy requires this expenditure to be charged to the profit and loss account as incurred: increase in the provision for post-retirement employee benets arising from actuarial valuations completed as at the date of acquisition: creation of a provision relating to the price participation agreement with ZCCM which obliges KCM to pay commission to ZCCM in the event that copper prices exceed a dened threshold: decrease in sundry debtor balances over which there is uncertainty as to their recoverability: and creation of a deferred tax asset arising from certain of the fair value adjustments set out above, offset by a reduction in the deferred tax asset attributable to tax losses over which there is uncertainty as to their recoverability in the time horizon permitted by the Groups accounting policies.

b Sterlite Employees Welfare Trust On 2 January 2004, the Group purchased 4.98% of Sterlites issued share capital from the SEWT for a cash consideration of $58.0 million, being the open market price at that date.
Following this acquisition, the Groups Economic Interest in Sterlite increased to 70.8%.
On 2 April 2004, the Group purchased 2.4% of Sterlites issued share capital from the SEWT for a cash consideration of $21.4 million, being the open market price at that date.
Following this acquisition, the Groups Economic Interest in Sterlite increased from 70.8% to 71.6%.
The SEWT is treated as a quasi-subsidiary and consolidated within the Financial Statements.
Consequently, as these acquisitions are intra-group transactions, the cash consideration eliminates on consolidation and is thus not included as an acquisition cash ow in the consolidated cash ow statement, and there is no cash impact to the Group.
At 31 March 2005, the SEWT held 3,559,263 shares in Sterlite at a cost of $7.8 million 31 March 2004: 5,049,297 shares at $9.0 million.
c Sterlite Rights Issue In September 2004, Sterlite completed its rights issue in which Twin Star subscribed for its own entitlement and those rights not taken up by the minority shareholders.
As a result of Twin Star subscribing $433 million to the total rights issue of $434 million, the Group increased its Economic Interest in Sterlite from 71.6% to 81.3%.
d Vedanta Alumina Limited VAL was a wholly owned subsidiary of Sterlite at 31 March 2004.
During the year ended 31 March 2005, an independent valuation of the business was carried out by KPMG jointly on behalf of Sterlite and Vedanta.
Based on this valuation, the value of VAL was determined at $138 million.
Based on Vedantas equity subscription of $100 million, undertaken in May 2004, Vedanta has a 70.5% interest in VAL thereby diluting Sterlites holding to 29.5%.
e Conversion of Sterlite Bonds As disclosed in note 33, Sterlite has bonds in issue which became convertible on 4 December 2003.
In the period from 4 December 2003 to 31 March 2005, 26,300 of these bonds were converted into ordinary shares in Sterlite which diluted the Groups Economic Interest in Sterlite by 1.4%.

DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 99 Vedanta Resources plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 28.
Financial Instruments The Groups accounting policies with regard to financial instruments are detailed in note 2.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
As permitted by FRS 13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosure, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures other than the currency disclosures.
Derivatives, Financial Instruments and Risk Management The Group uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
The use of derivatives can give rise to credit and market risk.
The Group controls credit risk by only entering into contracts with banks and institutions with the highest national or international standing.
The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits, authorities and regular monitoring by appropriate levels of management.
The limits, authorities and monitoring systems are periodically reviewed by management and the Board.
The market risk on derivatives is mitigated by changes in the valuation of the underlying assets, liabilities or transactions, as derivatives are used only for risk management.
Foreign Exchange Risk The Group uses forward exchange contracts, currency swaps, options and other derivatives to hedge the effects of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
The sources of foreign exchange risk are outstanding amounts payable for imported raw materials, capital goods and other supplies as well as nancing transactions, loans and current asset investments denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group is also exposed to foreign exchange risk on its exports.
Most of these transactions are denominated in US dollars.
The policy of the Group is to determine on a regular basis what portion of the foreign exchange risk on nancing transactions, loans and current asset investments are to be hedged through forward exchange contracts and other instruments.
There are systems in place for the review of open i. e. unhedged exposure limits and stop-loss levels by management.
Interest Rate Risk The short-term debt of the Group is principally denominated in Indian rupees with xed rates of interest.
While no significant interest rate risk arises on this portion of the debt, the Group utilises interest rate swap products to optimise the interest liability.
Most of the foreign currency debt is on oating rates of interest linked to sixmonth US dollar LIBOR.
The Group has a policy of selectively using interest rate swaps, option contracts and other derivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.
These exposures are reviewed by appropriate levels of management on a monthly basis.
Counterparty and Concentration of Credit Risk The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of debtors, current asset investments and derivative financial instruments.
There is no concentration of credit risk among the debtors of the Group given the large number of debtors and the business diversity.
Credit risk on debtors is very limited as almost all credit sales are against letters of credit of banks of national standing.
In respect of current asset investments, counterparty limits are in place to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty.
For derivative and financial instruments, the credit risk is limited as the Group only deals with banks and institutions with the highest national or international standing.
These exposures are further reduced by having standard ISDA Master agreements including set-off provisions with each counterparty.
Commodity Price Risk The Group has historically been extremely conservative in the use of derivatives for commodity hedging.
As much as possible, the Group tries to mitigate price risk through favourable contractual terms.
Moreover, hedging is used purely as a risk management tool and in some cases to secure future cash ows by entering into forward contracts or similar instruments.
Aluminium The raw material is mined in India with sales prices linked to the London Metals Exchange prices.
Currently no hedging is being done for Aluminium.
Copper Copper smelting operations at Tuticorin benefit from a natural hedge created by matching quotational periods for concentrate purchases with timing of nished metal sales.
The balance, the free metal being the difference between payable metal and recovery, and the previous metal content, are hedged through forward contracts or options.
For the mining assets in Australia and Zambia, the policy is to hedge a part of the production as determined by management.
Zinc and Lead The raw material is mined in India with sales prices linked to the London Metals Exchange prices.
Currently an element of exports out of India is hedged through forward contracts or other instruments.

Pensions The Group operates pension schemes for the majority of its employees in India, Australia and Zambia.
a Dened Contribution Schemes Indian Pension Schemes Central Provident Fund The Central Provident Fund relates to all full time Indian employees of the Group.
The amount contributed by the Group is a designated percentage of 12% of basic salary, together with an additional contribution of 12% of salary made by the employee.
The benefit is paid to the employee on their retirement or resignation from the Group.
Superannuation Superannuation, another pension scheme applicable in India, is applicable only to senior executives.
Each relevant company holds a policy with the Life Insurance Corporation of India LIC, to which each company contributes a xed amount relating to superannuation, and the pension annuity is met by the LIC as required, taking into consideration the number of years of service of the executive, and the contributions made.
Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a dened contribution basis and contributions are charged directly to the profit and loss account.
Pension Fund The Pension Fund was established in 1998 and is managed by the Government.
The employee makes no contribution to this fund but the employer makes a contribution of 8.33% of salary each month.
This must be provided for every permanent employee on the payroll.
At the age of 60 the statutory retirement age for all non-professional employees, contributions cease and the individual receives a monthly payment based on the level of contributions through the years, and on their salary scale at the time they retire, subject to a maximum ceiling of salary level.
The Government funds these payments, thus the Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes, regardless of whether the central fund is in surplus or deficit.
It is not possible to assess the Groups own level of assets or liabilities within the Pension Fund as it is effectively a multi-employer scheme.
On this basis, it is accounted for as a dened contribution scheme.
No information regarding the overall level of surplus or deficit in the fund is publicly available.
Australian Pension Schemes The Group also operates dened contribution pension schemes in Australia.
The contribution of a proportion of an employees salary into a superannuation fund is a compulsory legal requirement in Australia.
The employer contributes at least 9% of the employees gross remuneration into the employees fund of choice and the employee has the option to make additional voluntary contributions.
Zambian Pension Schemes The KCM Pension Scheme is applicable to full time permanent employees of KCM subject to the fullment of certain eligibility criteria.
The management of the scheme is vested in the trustees consisting of representatives of the employer and the members.
The employer makes a monthly contribution to the KCM Pension Scheme of an amount equal to 11% of that months pensionable salary and the member makes monthly contributions to the fund of an amount equal to 5% of that months pensionable salary.
All contributions to the KCM Pension Scheme in respect of a member cease to be payable when the member attains normal retirement age of 55 years, or upon leaving the service of the employer, or when the member is permanently medically incapable of performing duties in the service of the employer.
Upon such cessation of contribution on the grounds of normal retirement, or being rendered medically incapable of performing duties, or early voluntary retirement within five years to retirement, the member is entitled to receive an immediate annual pension equal to his accrued pension.
The member is allowed to commute his her accrued pension subject to certain rules and regulations.
The trustees of the KCM Pension Scheme may also allow purchase of an annuity for the benefit of members from a life assurance company or other providers of annuities subject to statutory regulations.
The Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes, regardless of whether the KCM Pension Scheme is in surplus or deficit.

Pensions continued b Dened benefit Schemes India The Gratuity schemes are dened benefit schemes which are open to all Group employees in India who have a minimum of five years of service with their employing company.
These schemes are funded by the Group, either through cash contributions or provisions each year, based on actuarial valuations.
Under these schemes, benets are provided based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate funds and a full actuarial valuation of the schemes is carried out on an annual basis.
KCM specified permanent employees of KCM are entitled to receive medical and retirement severance benefit.
This comprises two months basic pay for every completed year of service.
Under this scheme, benets are provided based on final pensionable pay and a full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out on an annual basis.
The accruals are not contributed to any fund and are in the form of provisions in KCMs accounts.
This scheme is accounted for as a dened benefit scheme and the main assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were a discount rate of 25% per annum and an annual salary increase of 25%.
c Pension Schemes existing within Group Companies As at 31 March 2005, membership of pension schemes across MALCO, BALCO, HZL and KCM stood at 20,868 employees 31 March 2004: 10,735.
The deficits and other aspects of these schemes are disclosed in further detail in notes d and e below.
MALCO MALCO does not contribute to the LIC.
Its Gratuity scheme is accounted for on a dened benefit basis.
The latest actuarial valuation was performed as at 31 March 2005 using the projected unit actuarial method.
At that date the fund was in deficit.
The main assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were a discount rate of 8% per annum and an annual salary increase of 5%.
BALCO At BALCO, all employees who are scheduled to retire on or before 31 March 2005 are covered by the LIC and therefore their remaining contributions are accounted for on a dened contribution basis.
However, the scheme is accounted for as a dened benefit scheme for all employees scheduled to retire after 31 March 2005, who are not covered by the LIC.
The main assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were a discount rate of 8.5% per annum and an annual salary increase of 5% for ofce staff and 3% for nonofce staff.
HZL HZL contributes to the LIC but the policy does not cover the full deficit of the Gratuity scheme.
HZLs Gratuity scheme is therefore accounted for on a dened benefit basis.
The main assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were a discount rate of 7.5% per annum and an annual salary increase of 5.0%.

Contingencies The Group has the following material contingencies.
With regard to the claims against Group companies included below, unless stated, no provision has been made in the Financial Statements as the Directors believe that it is more likely than not that the claims will not give rise to a material liability.
MALCO claims with Tamil Nadu Electricity Board TNEB Under the terms of a financial aid package, MALCO was entitled to benefit from reduced tariff electricity for the period from 1995 to 1999.
In 1997 MALCO became profitable and in 1999 the TNEB made a claim against MALCO for the difference in value between full price and reduced tariff electricity for the period from 1997 to 1999.
The value of this claim was $71.5 million.
The case was heard before the Madras High Court in November 1999 and it found in MALCOs favour.
TNEB has appealed the decision and this appeal has not yet been heard.
TNEB is also claiming $21.4 million from MALCO for an electricity self-generation levy for the period from May 1999 to June 2003.
This claim has arisen since the commissioning of MALCOs captive power plant in 1999.
The company has sought an exemption from the application of this levy from the Government.
The application is under consideration.
Meanwhile, the Madras High Court has granted an interim ruling in favour of MALCO pending a final decision.
MALCO claims with TECHMO Car SpA TECHMO In February 1999, MALCO entered into an agreement with TECHMO Car SpA to modernise the smelter pot rooms at Mettur Dam.
In February 2003, this contract was terminated by TECHMO following disputes over the project.
In March 2003, MALCO issued a claim against TECHMO to recover expenditure incurred on the project, citing non-performance by TECHMO.
The value of this claim was $5.8 million.
The District Court had ordered TECHMO to provide the full amount of the claim to MALCO as security, which was subsequently reversed by the Madras High Court.
MALCO has since led a petition with the Supreme Court of India, which as an interim measure has directed both parties to arbitration and for each party to furnish security of $1 million.
Separately, in June 2003, TECHMO moved for arbitration, claiming a total of $2.8 million being the unpaid portion of the contract.
Arbitration proceedings under ICC rules are currently underway.
National Thermal Power Corporation NTPC dispute with BALCO During the year ended 31 March 2005, BALCO has been in dispute with NTPC over the rates at which water and coal are supplied to the BALCO captive power plant which BALCO took over from NTPC.
BALCO asserts non-cooperation by NTPC, which has prevented BALCO from setting up its own coal handling and water pipeline facilties.
Subsequent to BALCO being successful in arbitration, NTPC appealed to the High Court in Delhi where NTPC gained an interim order raising water charges to nearly seven times the present level.
After the granting of an interim order, the High Court dismissed NTPCs appeal, against which NTPC has led a petition with the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court recommended that both parties should amicably settle the matter, and a hearing is expected in June 2005.
Meanwhile, negotiations are continuing with the NTPC over the rates being charged.
The adverse impact to BALCO, if this matter is decided against the company and the revised rates charged by NTPC are upheld, would be approximately $10.3 million per annum.
Ministry of Environment and Forest MOEF claim VAL In September 2004, VAL received environmental clearance from MOEF for its renery project in the State of Orissa, after which construction work on the renery project commenced.
Subsequently, claims were led with the Central Empowered Committee CEC of the Supreme Court of India which was constituted to look into environmental violations alleging that the land on which the renery was to be constructed included forestry, and the mine which was expected to source the renerys future bauxite requirements, would adversely affect the environment and therefore the construction work on the renery was in violation of MOEF guidelines.
VAL has since represented to MOEF that no forestry would be impacted by the construction of the renery.
VAL has also represented that the mining lease is owned by Orissa Mining Corporation Limited OMC, a Government of Orissa undertaking, which has applied to MOEF for the necessary clearance.
VAL is therefore of the view that the responsibility for obtaining the necessary mine clearance rests with OMC.
The MOEF has submitted an affidavit to CEC that it would not decide on the application for clearance of the mines submitted by OMC until CEC submits its report to the Supreme Court of India.
VAL led a writ petition in the Supreme Court seeking directions that MOEF decides on the forestry clearance.
The Supreme Court admitted the writ petition and has directed CEC to submit its report within eight weeks with a copy to MOEF.
The MOEF has subsequently been directed to submit its response.
