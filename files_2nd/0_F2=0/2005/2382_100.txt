2 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards The general principle that should be applied on first-time adoption of IFRS is that standards in force at the first reporting date for BP, 31 December 2005 should be applied retrospectively.
However, IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 1 contains a number of exemptions that companies are permitted to apply.
BP has taken the following exemptions: Comparative information on financial instruments is prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and the group has adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39 from 1 January 2005.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations has not been applied to acquisitions of subsidiaries or of interests in jointly controlled entities and associates that occurred before 1 January 2003.
Cumulative currency translation differences for all foreign operations are deemed to be zero at 1 January 2003.
The group has recognized all cumulative actuarial gains and losses on pensions and other post-retirement benefits as at 1 January 2003 directly in equity.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has been applied retrospectively to all share-based payments that had not vested before 1 January 2003.
As indicated above, BP adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 with effect from 1 January 2005 and, as permitted under IFRS 1, the group has not restated comparative information.
Had IAS 32 and IAS 39 been applied from 1 January 2003, the following adjustments would have been necessary in the financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2004 and 2003: All derivatives, including embedded derivatives, would have been brought on to the balance sheet at fair value.
Available-for-sale investments would have been carried at fair value rather than at cost.
The principal differences for the group between reporting on the basis of UK GAAP and IFRS are as follows: Ceasing to amortize goodwill.
Expensing a greater proportion of major maintenance costs.
Recognizing an expense for the fair value of employee share option schemes.
Recording asset swaps on the basis of fair value.
Setting up deferred taxation on: acquisitions: inventory valuation differences: unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates.
No longer recognizing dividends proposed but not declared as a liability at the balance sheet date.
Recognizing changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives in the income statement.
Further information regarding the impact of adopting IFRS is shown in Note 50, First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, in BP Annual Report and Accounts 2005.
Reconciliations of UK GAAP to IFRS for the 2003 and 2004 profit for the year and BP shareholders equity at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2004 are shown below.
