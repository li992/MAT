A R 2005 17 3 06 01:1 pm Page 70 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 33 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group does not enter into significant derivative transactions.
The Group's principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, guaranteed senior notes, cash and short term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group's operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group's policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained fundamentally unchanged since the beginning of 2000.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows in desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest as appropriate to the purposes of the borrowing depending on which gives best value.
Liquidity risk The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, loans and finance leases as appropriate.
Foreign currency risk The Group has operations around the world and therefore its balance sheet can be affected significantly by movements in the rate of exchange between sterling and various other currencies particularly the US dollar and euro.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of this structural currency exposure by borrowing in these currencies where appropriate while maintaining a low cost of debt.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures principally as a result of trading between Group companies.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the unit's functional currency.
Net cash flows between any two currencies of less than 1m per annum would not usually be considered sufficiently material to warrant forward cover.
Forward cover is not taken out more than twelve months in advance or for more than 80% of the forecast exposure.
2005 Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the Group as at 31st December was as follows: Fixed rate Floating rate Financial liabilities financial financial on which no Total liabilities liabilities interest is paid 000 000 000 000 Euro 37,593 214 25,525 11,854 US dollar 5,968 2,325 1,837 1,806 Other  65,409 4,427 33,457 27,525 In respect of fixed rate financial liabilities the interest rate for euro financial liabilities is 4.4% fixed for 0.5 years.
The interest rate for US dollar financial liabilities is 6.7% fixed for 0.1 years.
The benchmark rates for the floating rate financial liabilities are as follows: Japanese yen LIBOR } US dollar Euro LIBOR EURIBOR Interest rate risk profile of financial assets The interest rate profile of the financial assets of the Group as at 31st December was as follows: Floating rate Financial assets financial on which no Total assets interest is earned 000 000 000 Sterling 50,797 39,625 11,172 Other 93,113 12,303 80,810 143,910 51,928 91,982 Financial assets on which no interest is earned comprise trade and other receivables and cash at bank and in hand.
Floating rate financial assets comprise cash placed on money market deposit mainly at call and three month rates.
The average rate of interest received on sterling deposits during the year was 4.7%.
68 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc A R 2005 17 3 06 01:1 pm Page 71 Currency exposures As explained above, the Group's objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas in other words, its structural currency exposures are to maintain a low cost of debt while partially hedging against currency depreciation.
All gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are dealt with in the statement of total recognised income and expenditure.
Transactional or non-structural exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses that are recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures include the monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Group balance sheet that are not denominated in the operating or 'functional' currency of the operating unit involved.
At 31st December the currency exposures in respect of the euro was a net monetary asset of 206,000 and in respect of the US dollar a net monetary asset of 783,000.
At 31st December the percentage of debt to net assets, excluding debt was 50% for the euro and 19% for the US dollar.
Maturity of financial liabilities The Group's financial liabilities at 31st December reprice or mature if earlier in the following periods: Trade and Short term Finance Long term other payables Overdrafts borrowings leases borrowings Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 In six months or less, or on demand 27,525 - - 68 30,621 58,214 In more than six months but no more than twelve - 3,836 1,498 68 1,481 6,883 In more than one year but no more than two - - - 37 - 37 In more than two years but no more than three - - - 39 - 39 In more than three years but no more than four - - - 39 - 39 In more than four years but no more than five - - - 42 - 42 In more than five years - - - 155 - 155 27,525 3,836 1,498 448 32,102 65,409 Cash flow hedge At 31st December the Group had contracts outstanding to purchase 1,050,000 with South Korean Won.
Borrowing Facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31st December in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows: 000 Expiring in one year or less 19,241 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Fair values of financial assets and liabilities at 31st December are not materially different from book values due to their size or the fact that they were at short term rates of interest.
Fair values have been assessed as follows: Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are marked to market using year end exchange rates.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect change in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31st December, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates in respect of financial assets would increase the Groups profit before tax by approximately 500,000.
Since the year end loans totalling 17,736,000 have been repaid.
Consequently, in respect of financial liabilities, the Group is not significantly at risk from increases in interest rates.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in the value of sterling against other foreign currencies would have decreased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 500,000 for the year ended 31st December.
The forward exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.
