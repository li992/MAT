Capital continued Issue of ordinary shares During March 2005, 1,000,000 shares were issued to the ESOP at a market price of GBP10.20 per share.
Deferred shares The holders of deferred shares do not have the right to receive notice of any general meeting of the Company nor the right to attend, speak or vote at any such general meeting.
The deferred shares have no rights to dividends and, on a winding-up or other return of capital and entitle the holder only to the repayment of the amounts paid upon such shares after repayment of the nominal amount paid up on the Ordinary Shares, the nominal amount paid up on the special voting share plus the payment of GBP100,000 per ordinary share.
The Company may, at its option, redeem all of the deferred shares in issue at any time but subject to the minimum capital requirement of the Companies Act 1985 at a price not exceeding GBP1.00 for each share redeemed to be paid to the relevant registered holders of the shares.
Special voting share Certain rights, that are inalienable under Swiss law, have been preserved in the Xstrata plc Articles of Association by creating a special voting share that carries weighted voting rights sufficient to defeat any resolution which could amend or remove these entrenched rights.
The holder of the special voting share is the Law Debenture Trust Corporation plc which has entered into a voting agreement with the Company, specifying the conditions upon which it is entitled to exercise its right to vote.
The special voting share does not carry a right to receive dividends and is entitled to no more than the amount of capital paid up in the event of liquidation.
