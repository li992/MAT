These policies will be replaced by International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS with effect from 1 April 2005 and the group will publish its interim financial statements and 2006 Annual Report and Accounts in accordance with IFRS.
b Total operating profit comprises group operating profit amounting to 623.2 million 2004 570.1 million: 2003 510.0 million and share of operating profits of joint ventures of 22.7 million 2004 13.6 million: 2003 14.9 million.
For 2005, the above segmental analysis is combined with the non-operating exceptional credit of 8.6 million 2004 1.9 million: 2003 34.0 million as discussed in note 4 of the accounts, and net interest payable of 284.1 million 2004 248.1 million: 2003 231.4 million as shown in note 7 of the accounts, to give profit on ordinary activities before taxation of 370.4 million 2004 337.5 million: 2003 327.5 million.

e The inter-business eliminations are principally from business process outsourcing and infrastructure management, primarily to the licensed multi-utility operations, substantially within the United Kingdom.
f Business restructuring costs in 2005 of 29.7 million relate to severance costs of 22.9 million in licensed multi-utility operations, 4.9 million in business process outsourcing, 1.5 million in infrastructure management and 0.4 million of corporate costs.
Business restructuring costs in 2004 of 4.6 million related to costs arising from the Eurocall acquisition.
In 2003, severance costs of 3.8 million related to telecommunications.
In 2003, in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of xed assets and goodwill, the group carried out a review to determine whether there had been an impairment of its tangible and intangible xed assets within its telecommunications business, Your Communications.
The carrying values of tangible and intangible xed assets of each of Your Communications income generating units were compared to their recoverable amounts, being their values in use to the group.
The values in use of the income generating units were calculated using discounted cash ow projections and a discount rate of 16 per cent on a pre-tax basis.
The review resulted in an exceptional charge to operating profit in 2003 of 25.5 million of which 10.9 million related to intangible xed assets and 14.6 million related to tangible xed assets and an exceptional tax credit of 5.6 million.

The Green Energy business was also sold and a further credit was recognised relating to the withdrawal from infrastructure management in the Americas.
Together the transactions gave rise to an exceptional credit of 4.5 million.
In 2004, a credit of 4.3 million was recognised relating to the withdrawal from infrastructure management in the Americas.
IEBA, the Argentine electricity utility for which United Utilities has been technical operator and, in which the group had a minority interest, defaulted on its repayments to bondholders in September 2002.
There was no recourse to United Utilities in respect of those debts and the group has no further balance sheet exposure to IEBA.
Following the Argentine governments dissolution of the Peso US Dollar link, the subsequent devaluation of the Argentine Peso and the restrictions placed on the utilitys pricing policies, there was no expectation of a financial restructuring of the utility in which United Utilities would choose to participate.
United Utilities notied IEBA and its majority shareholder, Gruppo Camuzzi, that it would neither inject any additional equity into the company nor, with the exception of meeting the groups obligations under the technical support contract, participate in the future management of IEBA and its operating subsidiary, EDEA.
United Utilities therefore concluded that it no longer had a participating interest in IEBA.
The accounting provision that existed at 31 March 2002 in respect of the investment in Argentina was taken to the profit and loss account in 2003 which, along with the disposal of US Water and costs associated with withdrawing from infrastructure management in the Americas, gave rise to an exceptional credit of 34.0 million.
The group sold its minority interest in IEBA on 28 April 2005.

For the purposes of calculating the weighted average number of shares used in the earnings per share calculations, the A shares have been treated as part-paid ordinary shares, two A shares being equivalent to one ordinary share.
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated by dividing profit for the financial year attributable to shareholders by 789.2 million, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year including dilutive shares 2004 693.5 million: 2003 607.7 million.
The weighted average number of shares can be reconciled to the weighted average number of shares including dilutive shares as follows: 2005 2004 2003 million million million Average number of ordinary shares in issue basic 712.5 662.8 606.0 Average number of potentially dilutive ordinary shares under option 13.4 10.3 10.5 Number of ordinary shares that would have been issued at fair value 8.0 8.8 8.8 Number of A shares to be issued in 2005 ordinary share equivalent 154.6 82.8 Number of A shares that would have been issued at fair value ordinary share equivalent 83.3 53.6 Average number of ordinary shares in issue diluted 789.2 693.5 607.7 The basic and diluted weighted average number of shares were restated for all periods prior to the rights issue to reect the bonus element of the rights issue as required by FRS 14.
The adjustment factor, based on the consideration received from the first stage of the rights issue, is 0.9176, calculated using 531.5 pence per ordinary share, being the closing price on 26 August 2003, the date of approval of the rights issue at the EGM.

The adjusted weighted average number of shares was restated for all periods prior to the rights issue using an adjustment factor based on the consideration received from the first stage of the rights issue and assumed proceeds from the second stage, which are due to be received in June 2005.
The adjustment factor is 0.8646, calculated using 531.5 pence per ordinary share, being the closing price on 26 August 2003, the date of approval of the rights issue at the EGM.
This reects the full bonus element of the rights issue which arose at the first stage, as demonstrated by the movement in the share price following the approval of the rights issue at the EGM.
The calculation of adjusted earnings per share has been revised to exclude deferred tax to provide a better understanding of the trading position of the group and to clarify trends in trading performance as Ofwat, the regulator of the groups water and wastewater licensed multi-utility operation, sets price limits by reference to tax payments rather than the total tax charge.

24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT The primary financial risks faced by the group are interest rate risk and exchange rate risk.
The board has reviewed and agreed policies for managing each of these risks, as summarised below.
The board has also approved all of the classes of financial instruments used by the group.
The groups treasury function, which is authorised to conduct the day-to-day treasury activities of the group, reports at least annually to the board.
The group uses a variety of financial instruments, including derivatives, to raise finance for its operations and to manage the risks arising from those operations.
The group borrows in the major global debt markets in a range of currencies at both xed and oating rates of interest, using derivatives, where appropriate, to generate the desired effective currency prole and interest basis.
The effect of the use of derivatives is illustrated in note 23.
Under an interest rate swap, the group agrees with another party to exchange at specic intervals the difference between xed rate and oating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
The notional principal of these instruments reects the extent of the groups involvement in the instruments, but does not represent its exposure to credit risk, which is assessed by reference to the fair value.
Under a currency swap, the group agrees with another party to exchange the principal amount of two currencies, together with interest amounts in the two currencies agreed by reference to a specic interest rate basis and the principal amount.
The principal of these instruments reects the extent of the groups involvement in the instruments, but does not represent its exposure to credit risk, which is assessed by reference to the fair value.
All transactions are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities and no speculative trading is undertaken.
The counterparties to these instruments generally consist of financial institutions and other bodies with good credit ratings.
Although the group is potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties, such credit risk is controlled through credit rating reviews of the counterparties and by limiting the total amount of exposure to any one party.
The group does not believe it is exposed to any material concentrations of credit risk.
As noted above, the group uses derivatives to manage its exposure to currency risk on its borrowings.
Subsidiary undertakings make no significant sales or purchases in currencies other than that of the country in which they operate.
Accordingly, the group has no material unhedged foreign currency exposures.
Financial instruments utilised by the group can be summarised as follows: Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps are used solely to manage oating rate borrowings in order to reduce the financial risk to the group from potential future changes in medium-term interest rates.
Financial futures Financial futures are used to manage the groups exposure to possible future changes in short-term interest rates.
Forward contracts The group generally hedges foreign exchange transaction exposures up to one year forward.
Hedges are put in place using forward contracts at the time that the forecast exposure becomes reasonably certain.
Currency swaps The group uses currency swaps to hedge currency exposure where debt is raised in one currency to fund in a different currency.
74 United Utilities Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Fair values of financial instruments Fair value estimates are made at a specic point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.
These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgement and therefore cannot be determined precisely.
Changes in assumptions could signicantly affect the estimates.

The fair value of the groups listed investment in Manila Water Company Inc is 8.9 million based upon its closing share price at 31 March 2005.
Current assets and liabilities Financial instruments included within current assets and liabilities excluding cash and borrowings are generally short-term in nature and accordingly their fair values approximate to their book values.
Long-term receivables and liabilities The fair values of financial instruments included within long-term receivables and liabilities excluding borrowings are based on discounted cash ows using appropriate market interest rates.
Net borrowings and non-equity interests excluding foreign exchange contracts The carrying values of cash and short-term borrowings and current asset investments approximate to their fair values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of quoted long-term borrowings and guaranteed preferred securities is based on year-end mid-market quoted prices.
The fair value of other long-term borrowings is estimated by discounting the future cash ows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates prevailing at the year end.
Currency and interest rate swaps The group enters into currency and interest rate swaps in order to manage its foreign currency and interest rate exposures.
The carrying value of debt is shown in the balance sheet at the hedged rate.
The impact of the hedged currency rates as opposed to translation at year end exchange rates is 68.1 million 2004: 25.4 million.
The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future cash ows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates prevailing at the year end.
The fair values of currency and interest rate swaps exclude the related accrued interest receivables and payables.
Hedges Unrecognised gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities for which hedge accounting has been used at the balance sheet date were 152.4 million and 207.9 million respectively 2004 192.0 million and 135.9 million.
The group anticipates that 83.5 million of these gains and 72.2 million of these losses will be realised in the forthcoming financial year.
Of the unrecognised gains and losses on hedges as at 1 April 2004 the net gain recognised in the profit and loss account for the year ended 31 March 2005 was 40.2 million.

The amount of group profit for the financial year dealt with in the companys profit and loss account is 316.4 million 2004 269.6 million: 2003 601.8 million after accounting for dividends receivable from subsidiary undertakings of 323.2 million 2004 282.0 million: 2003 958.6 million.
The cumulative amount of goodwill included in reserves resulting from acquisitions, before FRS 10 became effective, net of goodwill attributable to subsidiaries or businesses demerged or disposed of prior to 31 March 2005, amounts to 1,023.0 million 2004 1,023.0 million: 2003 1,023.0 million.
Consolidated retained earnings at 31 March 2005 include retained losses of joint ventures and associated undertakings of 0.1 million 2004 11.8 million: 2003 12.5 million.
The cumulative amount of exchange adjustments included within consolidated retained earnings is 1.4 million 2004 5.1 million: 2003 7.3 million.
On 31 March 2005 the directors revalued the companys investment in one of its subsidiaries and made an adjustment in value of 1,201.0 million against the value of that asset.
The directors have considered the value of the companys other xed assets at the same time and are satisfied that the aggregate value of those xed assets was not less than the aggregate amount at which they are stated in the companys accounts.
Consequently, in accordance with section 275 of the Companies Act 1985, the adjustment in carrying value is not classied as a realised loss.
Accordingly the non-distributable other reserve of the company is adjusted to reect this valuation and is stated in the accounts on the basis that the revaluation of the companys xed assets took place at that time.
Apart from dividends from United Utilities Water PLC and United Utilities Electricity PLC, which are subject to certain regulatory restrictions, there are no significant statutory or contractual restrictions on the distribution of current profits of subsidiary or joint venture undertakings: undistributed profits of prior years are, in the main, permanently employed in the businesses of these undertakings.
The undistributed profits of group undertakings overseas may be liable to overseas taxes and or UK taxation after allowing for double taxation relief if they were to be distributed as dividends.
No provision has been made in respect of potential taxation liabilities on realisation of assets at restated or revalued amounts or on realisation of joint venture undertakings at equity accounted value.

The employee ShareSave scheme is available to all eligible employees and the company share option scheme 1999 is for senior executives excluding, with effect from the introduction of the groups long-term incentive plan, executive directors and other executives participating in that plan and its successor, the performance share plan.
The ShareSave scheme is based on SAYE savings contracts with options exercisable within a six-month period from the conclusion of a three or five-year period as appropriate from the date of grant.
Under the terms and conditions of this scheme, for every month up to no more than six months an employee fails to contribute the agreed monthly amount determined under the rules of the scheme, the last date exercisable will be delayed by one month.
Options under the company share option scheme 1999 are exercisable in a period beginning no earlier than three years five years for discounted options under the former executive share option scheme, which are no longer granted and ending no later than ten years from the date of grant.
2 The exercise price represents 85 per cent of the market price at the date the option was granted.
3 The exercise price equalled the market price at the date the option was granted.
United Utilities Annual Report & Accounts 2005 77 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued An opportunity to join the employee ShareSave scheme was offered during the years ended 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2003, and options were also granted under the company share option scheme 1999.
In the year ended 31 March 2005, options were granted under the option schemes in respect of a total of nil ordinary shares 2004 2,311,435 ordinary shares: 2003 4,016,642 ordinary shares, options for 4,361,127 ordinary shares 2004 521,504 ordinary shares: 2003 1,447,851 ordinary shares were exercised and options for 1,261,467 ordinary shares 2004 2,466,866 ordinary shares: 2003 349,451 ordinary shares lapsed or were cancelled.
United Utilities established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST in 1998, an employee benefit trust complying with requirements of the Finance Act 1989.
The QUEST trustee assumed the obligation to satisfy options granted under the existing United Utilities ShareSave scheme.
As a result of changes in the tax regime, shares have been allotted directly to ShareSave participants since 1 April 2003 and arrangements are now being made to wind up the QUEST.
There were no shares held in the QUEST at 31 March 2005.
The United Utilities Employee Share Trust was established by a trust deed executed on 21 August 1996.
The Trustees hold the trust fund for the benefit of the beneciaries being employees or former employees of the groups companies and their relatives to the extent determined by the rules of the share schemes.
As at 31 March 2005, the Trust held 52,500 shares on trust and these shares will be used to satisfy awards payable under the groups performance share plan.
All dividends payable on the shares during the year were waived.
The main all-employee scheme is the Inland Revenue approved share incentive plan, ShareBuy.
This is a exible way for employees to acquire shares in the company by buying partnership shares up to the lower of 1,500 or ten per cent of taxable pay each year.
The funds are deducted from pre-tax pay and passed to an independent trustee who makes a monthly purchase of shares at full market price.
Employees can reinvest the dividends on partnership shares to buy more shares under the plan.
In 2004, the company introduced matching shares.
It gives one free share for every five partnership shares bought.
The shares need to be held in trust for a five-year term in order to retain the maximum tax advantages.
26 PENSIONS The group participates in a number of pension schemes principally in the UK.
The major schemes are funded dened benefit schemes the United Utilities Pension Scheme UUPS and the United Utilities Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme ESPS the Schemes, of which the ESPS is closed to new employees.
UUPS also includes a dened contribution section which constitutes less than 0.5 per cent of the total asset value.
The assets of these Schemes are held in trust funds independent of group nances.
For UUPS and ESPS, the pension cost and asset under the accounting standard SSAP 24 have been assessed in accordance with the advice of a rm of actuaries, Mercer Human Resource Consulting, using the projected unit method.
For this purpose, the actuarial assumptions adopted are based upon investment growth of 7.6 per cent per annum pre retirement and 5.6 per cent per annum post retirement: pay growth of 4.1 per cent per annum for UUPS and 4.3 per cent per annum for ESPS and increases to pensions in payment and deferred pensions of 2.8 per cent per annum.
The actuarial value of the assets was taken as the market value of the assets.
The last actuarial valuations of the Schemes were carried out as at 31 March 2004.
The combined market value of the groups share of the assets of the Schemes at the valuation date was 1,839.9 million.
Using the assumptions adopted for SSAP 24, the combined actuarial value of the assets represented 97 per cent of the value of the accrued benets, after allowing for expected future earnings increases.
In deriving the pension cost under SSAP 24, the deficit in the Schemes Is being spread over the future working lifetime of the existing members.
For UUPS, the employers contributions have been assessed in accordance with the advice of Mercer Human Resource Consulting using different assumptions to those described above.
For ESPS, the employers contributions have been assessed in accordance with the advice of a rm of actuaries, Hewitt Bacon and Woodrow, using different assumptions and methods to those described above.
During the year ended 31 March 2005, the group contributed to UUPS at rates which ranged from 16.1 per cent to 30.3 per cent of pensionable salaries dependent upon benefit category.
In addition, further contributions were made to cover the cost of additional severance benets granted.
During the year ended 31 March 2005, the group contributed to ESPS at a rate of 19.0 per cent of pensionable salaries.
On 31 March 2005, the group made lump sum payments of 216.0 million and 103.5 million to UUPS and ESPS respectively.
The payments were in lieu of the estimated company contributions that would have been payable for dened benefit members over the five years from 1 April 2005.
Subject to the results of the actuarial valuations at 31 March 2007, company contributions will resume from 1 April 2010.
In the meantime, the group will continue to pay contributions in respect of the dened contribution members and insurance premiums.
Other payments will be made by the group in accordance with the funding agreement between the Trustee and the group.
The group also operates a series of unfunded, unapproved retirement benefit schemes.
The cost of the unfunded, unapproved retirement benefit schemes is included in the total pension cost, on a basis consistent with SSAP 24 and the assumptions set out above.
In accordance with these unfunded arrangements, the group has made payments to former directors, including lump sum payments, of 370,510 in total in the year ended 31 March 2005 2004 298,556: 2003 207,387.
The total pension cost for the period was 69.4 million, of which 14.9 million is included within the business restructuring exceptional item, 2004 11.2 million: 2003 8.2 million.
A prepayment of 401.2 million is included in the balance sheet at 31 March 2005 2004 97.0 million: 2003 58.5 million.
Information about the pension arrangements for executive directors is contained in the report on remuneration.
FRS 17 Transitional disclosures Group The pension cost gures used in these accounts comply with the current pension cost accounting standard SSAP 24.
Under transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement benets, the group is required to disclose the following information about its pension arrangements and the gures that would have been shown under adoption of FRS 17 in the financial statements.
The latest formal valuations of the Schemes were carried out as at 31 March 2004.
The valuation of liabilities detailed below has been derived by projecting forward the position at 31 March 2004 and has been performed by an independent actuary, Mercer Human Resource Consulting.
FRS 17 gives the present value of pension liabilities by discounting pension commitments including an allowance for salary growth, at an AA corporate bond yield.
The major difference arising between these two methodologies is in the valuation of the Schemes liabilities, which under FRS 17 are higher.
Deferred pensions are revalued to retirement age in line with the Schemes rules and statutory requirements.
The major financial assumptions used by the actuary were as follows: 78 United Utilities Annual Report & Accounts 2005 At 31 March At 31 March At 31 March 2005 2004 2003 Discount rate 5.40% 5.50% 5.50% Pensionable salary growth UUPS 4.10% 4.30% 4.00% Pensionable salary growth ESPS 4.30% 4.30% 4.00% Pension increases 2.80% 2.80% 2.50% Price ination 2.80% 2.80% 2.50% The assets and liabilities of the Schemes, along with the expected rates of return on the Schemes assets as at 31 March 2005, 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2003 were as follows: At 31 March 2005 At 31 March 2004 At 31 March 2003 Expected Expected Expected rate of Total rate of Total rate of Total return m return m return m Equities 7.60% 1,468.0 7.60% 1,268.9 7.50% 1,008.0 Property 7.60% 1.3 7.60% 2.1 7.50% 3.5 Bonds 5.40% 343.8 5.50% 193.2 5.50% 217.4 Gilts 4.60% 428.2 4.60% 383.4 4.50% 314.3 Other 4.60% 61.4 4.60% 1.7 4.50% 24.2 Market value of assets 2,302.7 1,849.3 1,567.4 Present value of Schemes liabilities 2,382.3 2,227.0 1,993.2 Implied deficit in the Schemes 79.6 377.7 425.8 Related deferred tax asset 23.9 113.3 127.7 Net pension liability under FRS 17 55.7 264.4 298.1 If the above amounts had been recognised in the financial statements, the groups net assets and profit and loss reserve as at 31 March 2005, 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2003 would be as follows: 2005 2004 2003 m m m Net assets excluding pension liability 3,118.7 3,102.9 2,551.3 SSAP 24 prepayment, net of deferred tax 280.8 67.9 41.0 Accruals for unfunded scheme 8.5 7.2 6.2 Pension liability 55.7 264.4 298.1 Net assets including pension liability 2,790.7 2,777.8 2,218.4 profit and loss reserve excluding pension liability 1,362.5 1,348.4 1,302.8 SSAP 24 prepayment, net of deferred tax 280.8 67.9 41.0 Accruals for unfunded scheme 8.5 7.2 6.2 Pension liability 55.7 264.4 298.1 profit and loss reserve including pension liability 1,034.5 1,023.3 969.9 The amounts which, on full implementation of FRS 17, will be required in the financial statements are as follows: Analysis of the amount charged to operating profit 2005 2004 m m Current service cost 55.5 45.1 Past service cost 0.6 1.8 Settlement gain 7.8 Total operating charge 48.3 46.9 Analysis of other finance costs 2005 2004 m m Expected return on pension scheme assets 124.3 108.4 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 122.8 115.0 Net return cost 1.5 6.6 United Utilities Annual Report & Accounts 2005 79 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued Analysis of amount recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses 2005 2004 m m Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 63.2 176.4 Experience gains and losses arising on the scheme liabilities 31.0 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 41.1 122.9 Actuarial loss gain 8.9 53.5 Movement on pension scheme deficit during the year 2005 2004 m m deficit at 1 April 264.4 298.1 Movement in year: Current service cost 55.5 45.1 Contributions 368.7 48.1 Past service cost 15.5 1.8 Settlement gain 7.8 Net interest return cost on assets 1.5 6.6 Actuarial loss gain 8.9 53.5 Movement in deferred tax asset 89.4 14.4 deficit in scheme at 31 March 55.7 264.4 History of experience of gains and losses 2005 2004 Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets: Amount m 63.2 176.4 Percentage of scheme assets 2.7% 9.5% Experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities: Amount m 31.0 Percentage of the present value of the scheme liabilities 1.3% Total amount recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses: Amount m 8.9 53.5 Percentage of the present value of the scheme liabilities 0.4% 2.4% In addition, 14.9 million 2004 nil: 2003 1.5 million of the past service cost is included for pension severance benets, within the business restructuring exceptional item.

The group accounts for the costs of pensions under the rules set out in UK GAAP.
US GAAP is more prescriptive in respect of the actuarial assumptions that must be used and the allocation of costs to accounting periods.
Furthermore, the actuarial valuation under US GAAP must be carried out on an annual basis.
Under UK GAAP, the pension cost is calculated based upon the actuarys best estimate of the assumptions taken as a whole.
The annual cost charged to the profit and loss account comprises the regular cost and variations.
The regular cost is calculated so that it represents a reasonably stable percentage of pensionable payroll.
Variations from the regular cost of providing pensions are generally spread over the expected remaining service lives of current employees in the scheme.
US GAAP requires each significant assumption to determine annual pension cost to be a best estimate with respect to that individual assumption.
For example, the discount rate used should be that for AA rated bonds with a similar maturity to the pension obligations, and the value of the scheme assets should be based upon market values at each balance sheet date.
Whilst US GAAP also adopts a spreading approach to allocating variations, it is more restrictive.
As a result, certain variations, for example, refunds from the scheme, would be recognised immediately rather than being spread forward.
US GAAP treats increases in pensions as a prior service cost and accordingly amortises its effects over the working lives of the members after the increase is awarded.
UK GAAP encourages expected increases to be provided for in advance by being built into the actuarial assumptions.
US GAAP requires a liability, the minimum pension liability, to be recognised that is at least equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation.
The corresponding entries are to intangible assets to the extent of unrecognised prior service cost and other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders equity.
Under UK GAAP, the group has recognised a prepaid pension cost of 401.2 million as at 31 March 2005 97.0 million as at 31 March 2004.
Under US GAAP, the group has recognised a pension prepayment of 178.7 million as at 31 March 2005 liability of 254.3 million, net of prepayment of 49.2 million, as at 31 March 2004, of which 172.0 million has been recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income as at 31 March 2005 302.0 million as at 31 March 2004. nil has been recorded as an intangible asset at 31 March 2005 1.5 million as at 31 March 2004. b Infrastructure renewals Under UK GAAP, the charge to the profit and loss account for depreciation reects the planned level of expenditure for infrastructure renewals.
The charge is adjusted under US GAAP to reect actual expenditure in the year.
Under UK GAAP, enhancement expenditure classied as infrastructure renewals expenditure is capitalised and depreciated in line with the policy on infrastructure renewals accounting.
Under US GAAP, enhancement expenditure is capitalised and depreciated over its estimated useful life.
c Depreciation of infrastructure assets Under UK GAAP, the depreciation charge for infrastructure assets is the estimated level of annual expenditure required to maintain the operating capability of the network, which is based on the groups independently certied asset management plan.
Under US GAAP, depreciation is charged on infrastructure assets using the straight-line method over a period of 100 years, being the estimated economic life.
d Provisions Provision accounting under UK GAAP is the same as under US GAAP, except as follows: Under UK GAAP, an investor is required to account for its proportionate share of net liabilities in a loss-making joint venture, even when there is no obligation to fund those liabilities.
Where this is the case, an investors share of net liabilities of an investment is shown as a provision rather than a negative xed asset.
The group held within provisions 38.3 million at 31 March 2002 to reect its proportionate share of net liabilities in IEBA, the Argentine electricity utility.
In the year ended 31 March 2003, the group concluded it no longer had a participating interest in IEBA and therefore ceased to account for the investment as a joint venture.
This conclusion gave rise to a release of the share of net liabilities of IEBA held at 1 August 2002.
86 United Utilities Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Under US GAAP, an investor should discontinue recording losses of an investment when the investment has been reduced to zero, unless the investor has an obligation or commitment to fund those liabilities.
As the group was not obligated or committed to funding the net liabilities of this investment, no such provision was recorded under US GAAP as at 31 March 2002.
Consequently, the exceptional credit to the profit and loss account in the year ended 31 March 2003 resulting from the withdrawal from IEBA did not arise under US GAAP since the provision was not recorded under US GAAP.
Under UK GAAP, restructuring charges are provided in full from the date of the announcement of the plan, including employee termination benets, property exit costs, equipment write downs and other restructuring related costs.
Under US GAAP, different requirements apply such that certain restructuring charges are recognised in different accounting periods compared with UK GAAP.
e Capitalisation of interest Under UK GAAP, the capitalisation of interest is not required and the group expenses interest charges to the profit and loss account in the year in which they are incurred.
Under US GAAP, interest charges on funds invested in the construction of qualifying assets during the time required to prepare them for their intended use are capitalised and amortised over the life of the respective assets.
f Goodwill Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 April 1998 is accounted for in accordance with FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets, and capitalised and amortised.
Prior to that date, goodwill arising on acquisitions was, and remains, written off against shareholders equity in the year of the acquisition.
On disposal or closure of all or part of a previously acquired business, any goodwill previously written off to reserves is included in calculating the profit or loss on disposal.
Where capitalised goodwill is regarded as having a limited useful economic life, FRS 10 requires the cost to be amortised on a straight-line basis over that life, which generally does not exceed 20 years.
Goodwill previously written off to reserves in the years ended 31 March 2005, 2004 and 2003, of nil, nil and 0.9 million respectively, was released from reserves in relation to disposals under UK GAAP.
Under US GAAP, prior to 1 April 2002, all goodwill was recognised in the balance sheet and amortised to the profit and loss account over its estimated useful life not exceeding 40 years.
With effect from 1 April 2002, the group adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS 142 Goodwill and other intangible assets.
Under SFAS 142, the group is no longer required to amortise goodwill, including that related to investments in joint ventures and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, but will be required to subject these assets to periodic testing for impairment.
SFAS 142 establishes a method of testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit to a value below its carrying value.
The goodwill test for impairment consists of a two-step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit, which is dened as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment.
The first step is a screen for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of impairment, if any, by determining the implied fair value of goodwill.
The evaluation of impairment of existing goodwill in April 2004 indicated no impairment under US GAAP at that time.
The group, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142, conducts impairment testing in April of each year or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment.
Any impairments will be charged to the profit and loss account.
Under UK GAAP, in the year ended 31 March 2005, the profit on sale or termination of operations reects the write off of goodwill net of accumulated amortisation.
Under US GAAP, the profit on sale or termination of operations reects the write off of goodwill net of accumulated amortisation, charged prior to the adoption of SFAS 142.
Therefore the profit on sale or termination of operations is 1.4 million lower under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP the gross goodwill adjustment as at 31 March 2005 was 1,042.8 million 1,041.2 million as at 31 March 2004.
The accumulated amortisation adjustment under US GAAP as at 31 March 2005 was 140.4 million 155.2 million as at 31 March 2004.
Goodwill amortisation including that related to investments in joint ventures under UK GAAP in the years ended 31 March 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 16.2 million, 8.8 million and 7.5 million respectively.
Under US GAAP, goodwill amortisation was nil in the years ended 31 March 2005, 2004 and 2003. g Impairment of long-lived assets Under UK GAAP, long-lived assets are assessed for impairment under FRS 11 Impairment of xed assets and goodwill, whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.
Any impairment is determined by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its recoverable amount, which is determined by reference to the estimated discounted cash ows to be generated from its use.
The recoverable amount should be estimated, for an individual asset where reasonably practicable, otherwise at the level of an income generating unit.
Dividing the total income of an entity into as many largely independent income streams as is reasonably practicable identies income generating units.
Generally, income generating units are smaller and at lower levels within the management structure than reporting units under SFAS 142.
If the events or circumstances that triggered the impairment no longer exist, the impairment may be reversed in subsequent periods.
Under US GAAP, long-lived assets, other than goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life, are assessed for impairment under SFAS 144 Accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.
Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are assessed for impairment under SFAS 142 as discussed in note f above.
Under SFAS 144, assets are assessed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying value of the asset with the estimated undiscounted cash ows to be generated by the asset.
If this test indicates a deficit, any impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value, which is usually determined by reference to estimated discounted cash ows.
Under US GAAP, the restoration of a previously recognised impairment loss is not permitted.
In accordance with FRS 11, the group performed an impairment review on certain long-lived assets within its infrastructure management business in the year ended 31 March 2005.
This resulted in an adjustment to value of tangible assets of 1.6 million.
Under US GAAP, there was no indication of impairment of the tangible assets on an undiscounted cash ow basis in accordance with SFAS 144.
Under UK GAAP, a previously recognised impairment of 0.7 million was reversed in the year ended 31 March 2005.
Under US GAAP, this impairment may not be reversed.
The group also performed an impairment review within its telecommunications business in the year ended 31 March 2003.
This resulted in an exceptional adjustment to value of 25.5 million representing tangible assets of 14.6 million, definite-lived intangible assets of 8.6 million, and goodwill of 2.3 million.
Under US GAAP, there was no indication of impairment of tangible or definite-lived intangible assets in the telecommunications business on an undiscounted cash ow basis in accordance with SFAS 144.
In addition, no impairment of telecommunications goodwill under SFAS 142 was required, as stated in note f above due to the difference in asset groupings under UK GAAP income generating units and US GAAP reporting units.
The tangible and definite-lived intangible assets continue to be depreciated under US GAAP resulting in a charge to the profit and loss account of 3.2 million and 3.3 million in the years ending 31 March 2005 and 2004 respectively.
There was no impairment of goodwill in 2005 or 2004 under UK or US GAAP.
United Utilities Annual Report & Accounts 2005 87 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued h Derivatives and hedging activities Under UK GAAP, the group does not recognise derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet nor are mark-to-market amounts recorded in net income.
Interest differentials on derivative instruments are charged to the profit and loss account as interest costs in the period in which they are realised.
Changes in the market value of futures trading contracts are reected in the profit and loss account in the period in which the change occurs.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are hedged by a foreign currency derivative are translated using the contract rate in the hedging derivative.
Under US GAAP, the group adopted SFAS 133 Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities SFAS 133 on 1 April 2002.
SFAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments are recognised as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value, regardless of the purpose or intent in holding them.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognised periodically either in earnings or shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as a hedge of changes in fair value or cash ows.
For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in fair value of the hedged item and the derivative are recognised currently in earnings.
For derivatives designated as cash ow hedges, fair value changes of the effective portion of the hedging instrument are recognised in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet until the hedged item is recognised in earnings.
The ineffective portion of the fair value changes are recognised in earnings immediately.
Changes in the fair value of the underlying debt instruments are not recognised in net income or shareholders equity.
In accordance with the transition provisions of SFAS 133, the group recorded, at 1 April 2001, a net-of-tax cumulative-effect reduction of 88.1 million in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity to recognise at fair value all derivatives that were previously designated as cash ow type hedging instruments.
Of the transition adjustment of 88.1 million in accumulated comprehensive income, 79.2 million has been re-classied into earnings at 31 March 2005 67.1 million at 31 March 2004.
Additionally, a fair value adjustment recognised in accordance with the transition provisions of SFAS 133 increased debt by 163.0 million, which was offset by a corresponding amount to record derivatives previously designated as fair value type hedging instruments.
The fair value adjustment to debt is being amortised over the period of the debt in accordance with the transitional rules.
The group currently does not designate any of its derivative instruments as hedges under SFAS 133.
As a result, all derivative contracts have been recorded in the balance sheet at market value at the year end with changes in fair value recorded in earnings and all monetary assets and liabilities have been re-translated at spot rates.
The groups earnings under US GAAP will be more volatile because of the effect of derivative instruments.
At 31 March 2005 and 2004, the balance sheet includes current derivative assets of 152.4 million and 192.0 million, current derivative liabilities of 17.7 million and 23.2 million, and non-current derivative liabilities of 192.4 million and 180.8 million respectively.
Under UK GAAP, the group defers gains and losses on interest rate swaps that have been terminated over the period of the underlying debt that was originally hedged.
Under US GAAP, all interest rate swaps are marked-to-market through earnings.
Therefore the settlement of an interest rate swap has no further impact on reported earnings.
i Currency translation adjustments Under UK GAAP, currency translation adjustments on net borrowings used to finance foreign investments are taken to the statement of total recognised gains and losses to offset the foreign exchange exposure on foreign investments.
Under US GAAP, this offset is not available since the group elected not to designate any instruments as hedges in the year ended 31 March 2002.
In the years ended 31 March 2005, 2004 and 2003, there was no currency translation adjustment resulting from the investment in IEBA since the investment had been reduced to zero.
j Share compensation costs Under UK GAAP, the groups UK ShareSave scheme is exempt from the requirement to recognise any compensation expense and is therefore accounted for as a non-compensatory plan.
Compensation expense is recorded in respect of the executive share option schemes for the difference, if any, between the exercise price and the share price at the date of grant.
Compensation expense is recorded for the performance share plan on a straight-line basis over the period in which performance is measured.
Under US GAAP, the group accounts for stock issued to employees in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25 APB 25 Accounting for stock issued to employees.
Under APB 25, options granted under the UK ShareSave scheme are treated as compensatory.
Also, under APB 25, the executive share option scheme and the performance share plan have been treated as variable plans due to performance conditions attached to the plans.
Accordingly, compensation expense has been recognised under US GAAP for the ShareSave scheme, the executive share option scheme and the performance share plan.
For all options that include performance-related criteria the cost is calculated as the difference between the option price and the market price at the end of the reporting period.
In respect of the ShareSave scheme, the cost is calculated as the difference between the option price and the market price at date of grant.
The cost is amortised over the period from the date the options are granted to the date they are first exercisable, that is, the vesting date.
Estimated compensation expense under UK GAAP for the performance share plan is recorded as a liability.
Under US GAAP, compensation expense is recorded as a credit to shareholders equity.
k Revenue and related profit recognition Under UK GAAP, non-refundable set up fees received from clients as a contribution to transition costs incurred at the commencement of a contract are offset against transition costs incurred, with any excess recognised as revenues over the period of the contract in line with forecast activity levels.
Under US GAAP, non-refundable set up fees received at the commencement of a contract are deferred and recognised on a straight-line basis over the longer of the expected client relationship or contractual term.
Under UK GAAP, xed fee elements within contractually dened revenues are recognised in the period in which services are billed in accordance with the pricing terms.
Under US GAAP, the xed fee elements are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract, unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or that obligations are fullled in a different pattern.
The reduction in revenue under US GAAP is 4.5 million in the year ended 31 March 2005 8.6 million and 40.9 million in the years ended 31 March 2004 and 2003 respectively.
Under UK GAAP, a provision is required to be recognised for a contract where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the benets expected to be received.
The provision is measured at the value of the net obligations and is recorded within operating expenses.
Under US GAAP, such a provision may not be necessary due to the different revenue recognition policies.
88 United Utilities Annual Report & Accounts 2005 l Business combinations For business combinations, the purchase method of accounting is used for UK GAAP whereby the acquiring entity allocates consideration for the transaction to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition with the difference treated as goodwill.
The group accounts for these business combinations on a consistent basis under US GAAP with the following exceptions: Under UK GAAP, the group recognises intangible assets separately in a business combination only when they can be disposed of separately without disposing of the business of the entity and their value can be measured reliably on initial measurement.
Under US GAAP, the group recognises acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if i they arise from contracted or other legal rights even if the assets are not transferable or separable from the acquired entity or from other rights and obligations: or ii they are capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged.
In connection with the business combination occurring in the year ended 31 March 2005, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded based on the preliminary estimate of fair value on acquisition.
Any change in the preliminary allocation will be reected as an adjustment to goodwill.
In connection with business combinations occurring in the year ended 31 March 2004, the group recognised intangible assets of 32.8 million under US GAAP, comprising customer relationships and customer lists which are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
As at 31 March 2005, the net book value of intangible assets under US GAAP was 23.8 million, net of 9.0 million of accumulated amortisation 2004: 32.2 million, net of 0.6 million accumulated amortisation.
Under UK GAAP, the fair value of the consideration payable includes an estimate of amounts that are deferred or that are contingent upon the future revenues of the acquired entity.
Under US GAAP, the contractual terms relating to the determination and payment of deferred and contingent consideration may cause elements of the total expected consideration to be treated as compensation cost for post acquisition services.
This element is accrued over the relevant service period.
In connection with business combinations occurring in the year ended 31 March 2004, the group recognised 4.3 million of contingent consideration as part of the purchase price of the acquired companies under UK GAAP.
This was reduced to 2.7 million in the year ended 31 March 2005, reecting the revision made to goodwill following reassessment of the likelihood of contingent consideration targets being achieved.
Under US GAAP, this contingent consideration will be recognised as compensation expense in future periods.
In the year ended 31 March 2005, 0.6 million 2004: nil was recognised as compensation expense under US GAAP.
m Deferred taxes Under UK GAAP, the group provides for deferred tax on a discounted basis in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of available evidence, it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Under US GAAP, deferred taxation is provided for all temporary differences differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their corresponding tax bases on a full liability basis.
Certain items that are treated as permanent differences under UK GAAP are treated as temporary differences under US GAAP.
Deferred tax assets are also recognised net of a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realised.
Under US GAAP, discounting of deferred taxes is not permitted.
n Dividends Under UK GAAP, the proposed dividends on ordinary and A shares, as recommended by the directors, are deducted from shareholders equity and shown as a liability in the balance sheet at the end of the period to which they relate.
Under US GAAP, such dividends are only deducted from shareholders equity at the date of formal declaration of the dividend by the board of directors.
Consequently dividends under US GAAP for the year ended 31 March 2005 are 318.0 million 2004: 281.2 million, 2003: 262.4 million.
o Earnings per share EPS Under UK GAAP, basic EPS is based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
EPS is the profit in pence attributable to each equity ordinary share, based on the profit for the financial year attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year and ranking for dividend in respect of the period.
This method is also used for basic EPS under US GAAP.
Under UK GAAP, FRS 14 expressly permits the disclosure of an additional earnings per share measure provided that the unadjusted earnings per share is given at least equal prominence and it is calculated on a consistent basis over time.
The weighted average number of shares has been restated for periods prior to the rights issue, using an adjustment factor of 0.9176, based on the consideration received from the first stage of the rights issue.
Further details are provided in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements.
The same restatements are required under UK and US GAAP.
Under UK and US GAAP, diluted EPS must be disclosed.
This is based on net income and computed using the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year and the dilutive effect of all share options and ordinary share equivalents.
This method is similar to the treasury stock method used to calculate diluted EPS for US GAAP purposes.
Earnings per share computed in accordance with US GAAP has been based on the following number of shares: 2005 2004 2003 million million million Weighted average number of ordinary shares under US GAAP basic EPS 712.5 662.8 606.0 Common stock equivalents dilutive share options 5.4 3.9 2.3 Number of A shares to be issued in 2005 ordinary share equivalent 154.6 82.8 Number of A shares that would have been issued at fair value ordinary share equivalent 83.3 53.6 Weighted average number of ordinary shares under US GAAP diluted EPS 789.2 695.9 608.3 p New US accounting standards and pronouncements not yet effective Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement No.
151 SFAS 151 Inventory costs, issued in November 2004, provides guidance for accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight handling costs and spoilage and allocation of xed production overhead.
This accounting standard is applicable for accounting periods beginning after 15 June 2005 and will be adopted by the group from 1 April 2006.
Adoption of SFAS 151 is not expected to have a material impact on the groups financial position, results of operations or cash ows.

Adoption of SFAS 153 is not expected to have a material impact on the groups financial position, results of operations or cash ows.
123 Revised SFAS 123R Share based payment, issued in December 2004, requires compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions to be recognised in the financial statements.
Previously, a choice existed under US GAAP to account for these transactions either under APB 25 Accounting for stock issued to employees, or SFAS 123 Share based payment.
This accounting standard is applicable for accounting periods beginning after 15 December 2005 and will be adopted by the group from 1 April 2006.
The group has not determined the effect, if any, of SFAS 123R on the groups financial position, results of operations or cash ows.
47 FIN 47 Accounting for conditional aasset retirement obligations, issued in March 2005, claries the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No.

This interpretation will be effective as of 1 April 2005.
The group has not determined the effect, if any, of FIN 47 on the groups financial position, results of operations or cash ows.
q Classication differences between UK and US GAAP In addition to the differences between UK and US GAAP related to the recognition and measurement of transactions by the group, there are also a number of differences in the manner in which items are classied in the consolidated profit and loss account and consolidated balance sheet.
These classication differences have no impact on net income or shareholders equity.
Provisions for liabilities and charges Provisions for liabilities and charges under UK GAAP include 17.3 million 2004: 8.3 million that is due within one year and which would be reclassied to current liabilities under US GAAP.
Grants Under UK GAAP, grants other than capital contributions towards infrastructure assets are disclosed within deferred grants and contributions as creditors in the balance sheet.
Under US GAAP, these amounts are classied differently and would be set against the assets to which they relate.
Consequently 302.0 million 2004: 298.1 million would be classied within tangible xed assets under US GAAP, rather than as a long-term liability under UK GAAP.
Exceptional items Under UK GAAP, exceptional items are material items that derive from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of a reporting entity and which individually, or if of a similar type in aggregate, are required or expressly permitted to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to give a true and fair view.
Exceptional items under UK GAAP in the year ended 31 March 2005, amount to a net charge of 21.1 million and comprise 29.7 million business restructuring charges offset by 4.1 million profit on disposal of xed assets and 4.5 million profit on sale or termination of operations.
Exceptional items are discussed further on page 17.
In the years ended 31 March 2005, 2004 and 2003, the profit on sale or termination of operations was disclosed as an exceptional item, after operating profit.
In the years ended 31 March 2005 and 2004, the profit loss on disposal of xed assets was disclosed as an exceptional item, after operating profit.
Under US GAAP, all exceptional items would have been reected within operating profit.
Equity method investments Under UK GAAP, the share of joint ventures operating results excludes share of joint ventures interest and share of joint ventures tax.
These amounts are included within Interest payable and similar charges and Taxation charge respectively.
Under US GAAP, all of these amounts are included within Equity in earnings losses of afliates.
Under UK GAAP, investments in joint ventures are classied under the heading investments within xed assets.
Under US GAAP, investments in joint ventures are classied as investments in equity afliates.
r Cash ows Under UK GAAP, the group complies with FRS 1 Revised Cash ow statements, the objective and principles of which are similar to those set out in SFAS 95 Statement of cash ows.
The principal difference between the two standards is in respect of classication.
Under FRS 1 Revised, the group presents its cash ows for a operating activities: b returns on investments and servicing of finance: c taxation: d capital expenditure and financial investment: e acquisitions and disposals: f equity dividends paid: g management of liquid resources: and h nancing activities.
SFAS 95 is less prescriptive and recognises only three categories of cash ow activity a operating: b investing: and c nancing.
Cash ows arising from taxation and returns on investments and servicing of finance under FRS 1 Revised would be included as operating activities under SFAS 95: dividend payments would be included as a nancing activity under SFAS 95 and cash ows from capital expenditure, long-term investments, acquisitions and disposals would be included as investing activities under SFAS 95.
In addition, under FRS 1 Revised, cash represents cash at bank and in hand, less bank overdrafts: cash equivalents i. e. liquid resources are not included with cash.
Movements of liquid resources are included under a separate heading.
Under US GAAP, cash is not offset by bank overdrafts repayable within 24 hours from the date of the advance.
Such overdrafts are classied within nancing activities under US GAAP.

t Presentation of financial information In accordance with UK GAAP, the group uses a three-column format for its consolidated profit and loss account that separates exceptional items that meet the denition of exceptional items under FRS 3 Reporting financial performance, and amortisation of goodwill from other costs.
This presentation is permitted under UK GAAP and provides certain additional information in order to provide readers with an increased insight into the underlying performance of the business, in line with managements own view.
The presentation of such subtotals is not permitted on the face of the financial statements under US GAAP.
An explanation of these presentations is given below.
Total operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items and profit before tax before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items Total operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items is directly derived from the consolidated profit and loss account of the consolidated financial statements.
Management believes this financial measure provides useful information to investors as it represents the total of the operating profits losses for each segment, which is the measure that management uses to evaluate segmental trading performance.
It therefore aligns the performance measure reported to investors with that used by management to monitor performance and allocate resources within the business.
Management uses total segmental operating profits losses to evaluate the trading performance of each segment, because management believes that the exclusion of goodwill amortisation a non-cash item and exceptional items which, by virtue of their size or incidence, have been disclosed separately and may vary signicantly each year provides a more accurate comparison of annual segmental results, which in turn allows a better understanding of actual segmental trading performance.
In assessing the financial position and results of operations, management believes that providing additional measures under UK GAAP, which remove the positive and or negative impact of exceptional items and the non-cash impact of goodwill amortisation, gives a clearer understanding of the groups core trading activities, is of relevance in assessing the future direction of the group, and claries the trends in trading performance.
The inclusions of total operating profit and total operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items and profit before tax and profit before tax before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items allows a complete analysis of the core trading performance as well as the impact of these exceptional and non-cash items.
Under UK GAAP, exceptional items are material items that derive from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of a reporting entity and which, individually, or if of a similar type in aggregate, are required or expressly permitted to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to give a true and fair view.
Exceptional items, which are disclosed separately under UK GAAP in accordance with FRS 3 Reporting financial performance, are as follows: 2005 2004 2003 For the year ended 31 March m m m Operating exceptional items: Business restructuring 29.7 4.6 3.8 FRS 11 adjustment to carrying value of telecoms assets 25.5 Non-operating exceptional items: profit on sale or termination of operations 4.5 4.3 34.0 profit loss on disposal of xed assets 4.1 2.4 21.1 2.7 4.7 United Utilities Annual Report & Accounts 2005 91 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued Business restructuring costs in 2005 of 29.7 million mainly relate to the restructuring programmes in licensed multi-utility operations in preparation for meeting its 2005-10 efficiency challenges, in infrastructure management relating to the restructuring of the business units into market-facing business streams, focusing on their specic risks, and in business process outsourcing, a restructuring to form a divisionalised structure which better reects the markets in which the business operates.
Business restructuring costs in 2004 of 4.6 million related to costs arising from the integration of the Eurocall business acquired by Your Communications.
Business restructuring costs are considered to be exceptional items under UK GAAP as they are significant programmes for the businesses concerned.
FRS 3 therefore expressly permits disclosure of these costs as exceptional items within the income or expense heading to which they relate.
Under UK GAAP, the group performed an impairment review within its telecommunications business in accordance with FRS 11 in the year ended 31 March 2003.
This resulted in an adjustment to value of 25.5 million, which was considered to be an exceptional item by virtue of its size and nature.
FRS 3 therefore expressly permits disclosure of this adjustment as an exceptional item within the income or expense heading to which it relates.
The profit on sale or termination of operations relates to the groups withdrawal from various infrastructure management businesses.
In the year ended 31 March 2003, the group concluded it no longer had a participating interest in IEBA, the Argentine utility for which United Utilities had been technical operator, and in which the group had a minority interest.
It therefore ceased to account for the investment as a joint venture.
In 2004 and 2005, further credits were recognised relating to the withdrawal from infrastructure management in the Americas.
In 2005, the group disposed of its Green Energy business and reduced its shareholding in Manila Water Company through an initial public offering.
FRS 3 requires that profits or losses on the sale or termination of an operation be shown separately on the face of the profit and loss account after operating profit and before interest.
The profit and loss on disposal of xed assets in the years ended 31 March 2005 and 2004 respectively, relate to the disposal of xed asset investments.
FRS 3 requires that profits or losses on the disposal of xed assets be shown separately on the face of the profit and loss account after operating profit and before interest.
Although management uses these financial measures and the segmental analysis as shown in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements to analyse trading performance, total operating profit and profit before tax should also be considered.
Due to the presentation of these additional measures the condensed income statement in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation S-X based on UK GAAP amounts is presented below.
2005 2004 2003 For the year ended 31 March m m m Net sales and gross revenues 2,253.9 2,060.0 1,878.8 Costs and expenses applicable to sales and revenues 931.9 834.1 733.7 Depreciation and amortisation 381.4 376.1 356.9 Other operating costs 136.2 107.4 87.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 147.8 130.8 119.5 Provision for doubtful accounts and notes 40.8 52.8 52.1 Operating income 615.8 558.8 529.1 Non-operating income 16.0 13.2 14.9 Interest and amortisation of debt discount and expense 270.9 237.6 220.1 Income before income tax expense, minority interests and equity investees 360.9 334.4 323.9 Income tax expense 37.7 27.5 45.7 Minority interests in income of consolidated entities 1.8 1.6 2.3 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities and 50 per cent or less owned persons 11.7 0.7 1.9 Net income 333.1 361.0 277.8 Basic earnings per share 46.8p 54.5p 45.8p Diluted earnings per share 42.2p 52.1p 45.7p Net debt Net debt is a UK GAAP measure that is required to be disclosed in accordance with FRS 1 Cash ow statements revised 1996.
Net debt is dened as borrowings comprising debt, together with derivatives and obligations under finance leases less cash and liquid resources.
Management uses net debt, which is reconciled to gross debt in note 23 of the consolidated financial statements, to assess the groups liquidity position by reference to the groups committed level of funding.
The group seeks to ensure that sufficient funding is available to meet foreseeable requirements plus headroom for contingencies.
38 RESTATEMENTS TO EARNINGS PER SHARE As described in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements and note 37 o, earnings per share has been restated for all periods prior to the rights issue to reect the bonus element of the rights issue, as required by FRS 14 under UK GAAP.
The same adjustments are required under US GAAP.
