Share based payments continued b Equity-settled share option plan The group has two unapproved option plans to provide employees and executives with the opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the company as an incentive to attract and retain the services of employees.
The two plans are the UK Discretionary Option Scheme 1996 the UK Scheme and the 1998 US Share Option Plan the US Plan.
Under the terms of these plans, options are granted with exercise prices not less than the fair market value of the Companys shares, become exercisable as established by the Board of Directors generally three to four years, and generally expire seven years from the date of grant.
Vested options are exercisable following termination of employment for periods ranging from zero to 90 days.
The following tables summarize options outstanding as at 31 December 2005.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Share option exercise prices were automatically adjusted to reflect the changes in the companys share capital structure arising in connection with the companys December 2005 rights issue.
The effect of the adjustment was to ensure that employees were not unfairly discriminated against as company stakeholders following the dilution of the companys share price as a result of the rights issue.
No fair value adjustments arose as a result of this transaction.
