Certain of the companies acquired during 2005 participate in industry sponsored pension schemes.
A provision of 835,000 2004 - nil is included in long term provisions in respect of the groups obligations to these industry sponsored pension schemes.
Deferred Tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting period.
Deferred Tax continued Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2005 2004 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 386,994 296,697 Deferred tax assets 25,086 26,125 361,908 270,572 At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 11,940,000 2004 - 7,880,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates are insignificant.

From correspondence received in 2005 it is expected that the issue will be heard by the Special Commissioners later in 2006.
In the event of proven liability the Group holds a full tax indemnity from UBM and accordingly no provision for any liability is reflected in these financial statements.

Explanation of Transition to IFRS This is the first year that the Group has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The following disclosures are required in the year of transition.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 December 2004 and the date of transition to IFRS was 1 January 2004.
Differences between IFRS and UK GAAP Dividends - IAS 10, Events After the Balance Sheet Date Dividends proposed are disclosed but are not recognised as liabilities until they are appropriately approved by the shareholders.
Employee Option and Performance Share Schemes - IFRS 2, Share-based Payments All transactions within the scope of IFRS 2 are measured based on the fair value of the option or award at grant date and expensed to the Income Statement over the vesting period of the scheme.
Pension Costs - IAS 19, Employee Benefits Under IAS 19, the pension scheme liability is shown gross of the related deferred tax asset.
Holiday Pay - IAS 19, Employee Benefits IAS 19 requires the recording of a holiday pay accrual.
The holiday year of the Group is the calendar year and no holidays can be carried forward.
Consequently, no accrual is required at the year end but an accrual was made at 30 June 2004 and 30 June 2005.
Goodwill - IAS 38, Intangible Assets Under IAS 38 goodwill is not amortised.
Instead it is subject to an annual impairment review.
Associates - IAS 28, Investment in Associates IFRS requires the share of profit of Associates to be shown post tax IAS 1.
Under UK GAAP this amount is shown before tax with the tax charge included as part of the Group tax charge.
Deferred Tax - IAS 12, Income Taxes IAS 12 requires a deferred tax liability to be recognised on all temporary timing differences.
Under this methodology, a potential liability arises from the value attributed to publishing rights and titles from previous acquisitions, together with any properties that do not qualify for tax allowances.
As the Group has elected, under IFRS 1, not to restate prior acquisitions at transition date to an IFRS 3 basis then recognition is against equity reserves rather than against goodwill.
Cash Flow The cash flow differences between UK GAAP and IFRS are all either movements within a classification adjustments netting to zero or presentational.
There is no impact on the final cash position nor the movement in the period.
The IFRS cash flow with comparative information is presented on page 58.
The reconciliations of equity and profit below, together with the explanations of the changes, are provided to facilitate the understanding of changes arising from the adoption of IFRS.
