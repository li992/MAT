3 Demerger of South Staffordshire Plc and Related Transactions On 6 April 2004 the following transactions were effected: i South Staffordshire Water PLC and a number of related businesses were demerged from the continuing group by way of a dividend in specie.
ii The share capital of the Company was consolidated, with existing shareholders entitled to receive four shares in the continuing group for every five shares previously held.
iii The Company acquired the 24.98 per cent.
minority shareholding in the Homeserve domestic division in a share for share exchange resulting in the issue of 11,600,000 new shares in the Company.
The results of the demerged businesses have been reported within discontinued operations for the year ended 31 March 2005 and the previous year.
The amounts presented for discontinued operations take account of certain consolidation eliminations and adjustments which are necessary to fully reflect the results of the discontinued operations within Homeserve plc.
The total costs of completing these transactions amounted to 4,216,000 and were accrued in full at 31 March 2004 and were included in the profit and loss account as exceptional costs as they relate to a fundamental reorganisation of the activities of the Group.
No corporation tax relief on these costs has been assumed as the amount of any such deduction is currently uncertain.
These exceptional costs had no impact on the minority interest charge.
In addition to the exceptional transaction costs described above, an exceptional operating cost of 2,400,000 was incurred as a consequence of the decision to acquire the minority interest in the Homeserve domestic division.
The fair value of shares issued by the Company in 2001 in respect of a previous transaction in Homeserve was being amortised, in accordance with UITF 17, over a five year period ending on 31 March 2006.
The exceptional charge represents the write-off of the unamortised balance at 31 March 2004.
This exceptional charge is mirrored by an exceptional credit to the minority interest charge of 2,400,000 in connection with the same transaction.
The result of these two exceptional items is that there is no net impact on reported profit for the financial year or earnings per share.
Other operating costs for 2004 include exceptional costs of 2,400,000 within continuing operations as described in note 3.
Other operating costs include 4,013,000 2004: 4,497,000 in respect of operating lease rentals which relate principally to land and buildings and motor vehicles.

The principal differences between the total current tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of corporation tax are as follows: 2005 2004 000 000 Tax on loss profit at standard rate of corporation tax 2,587 11,352 Exceptional costs not deductible for tax purposes 11,745 1,248 Goodwill not deductible for tax purposes 2,966 2,119 Overseas losses not deductible for tax purposes 270 112 Other expenses not deductible for tax purposes 149 690 Depreciation in excess of capital allowances capital allowances in excess of depreciation 489 1,362 Adjustments in respect of prior years 137 105 Current corporation tax charge for the year 13,169 14,264 9 Dividends Paid and Proposed 2005 2004 000 000 Equity interests Interim dividend paid of 5.1p 2004: 6.1p per share 3,203 3,859 Proposed dividend of 10.9p 2004: 13.9p per share 6,830 8,874 10,033 12,733 A nominal dividend of 0.01 pence per share is proposed in respect of 1,191,314 shares held by the Homeserve Employee Trust in accordance with a Deed of Waiver dated 31 December 1992.
Due to the demerger, 4.5m of the final dividend in 2004 was paid by Homeserve plc and 4.4m by South Staffordshire Plc to shareholders on their respective registers.
As a result of the post year end share consolidation at Homeserve plc and share split at South Staffordshire Plc, the amounts payable were 8.8p per Homeserve share and 34.4p per South Staffordshire share held.
These combined payments are equivalent to 13.9p per share in the Company in issue on 31 March 2004.
10 Earnings per Share The calculation of earnings per share is based on profit after tax and minority interests divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the financial period.
Diluted earnings per share takes into account the dilution effect of the full exercise of all share options granted by the Company by comparing the difference between the weighted average exercise price of exercisable share options with the average share price over the period.
The underlying adjusted earnings per share has been calculated by excluding the amortisation of goodwill and exceptional costs.
This is considered to be a better indicator of the underlying performance by the Company.

The Group participates in the Water Companies Pension Scheme, by way of a separate sub-fund, which provides benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution Money Plan Pension Schemes.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group, being invested by discretionary fund managers.
The contributions to the defined contribution schemes are charged against profits as incurred.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account for the defined benefit scheme is the estimated regular cost of providing the benefits accrued in the year, adjusted to reflect variations from that cost.
The regular cost of the defined benefit scheme is calculated so that it represents a substantially level percentage of current and future pensionable payroll.
Variations from regular cost are charged or credited to the profit and loss account over 13 years, being the estimated average remaining working life of Scheme members.
The regular cost and the variations are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations, using the current unit method for death in service benefits and the projected unit method for other benefits.
The most recent actuarial valuation at 1 April 2002 showed the market value of the Groups sub-fund as 121.3 million, and that the actuarial value of those assets represented 113% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
As required by SSAP 24, the figures included in the accounts in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme are based on the 1 April 2002 actuarial valuation.
This does not take into account any impact of the fall in general stock market values since that date.
Any such impact will be reflected in the next SSAP 24 triennial valuation as at 1 April 2005 based upon which subsequent pension costs will be determined until the adoption of FRS 17.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries, wages and pensions.
The valuation at 1 April 2002 assumed that equity returns would be 7.2% per annum, that salary and wage increases would average 4.8% per annum and that present and future pensions would increase at the rate of 2.8% per annum.
In accordance with the recommendations of the actuary, the amount charged to the profit and loss account for the defined benefit scheme in 2005 was 575,000 2004: 1,890,000 representing an employers contribution rate of 16.3%.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account for the various defined contribution schemes in 2005 was 1,098,000 2004: 975,000.
Changes to pension arrangements following the demerger Following the demerger, a separate sub-fund has been established within the Water Companies Pension Scheme for Homeserve plc.
The rules and the benefit basis for employees has been replicated for the new sub-fund.
Homeserve plc is the designated employer.
Active members employed in the Homeserve group have been transferred into the new fund, as were deferred members.
All pensioners at 6 April 2004 remained in the existing South Staffordshire Water sub-fund.
68 active members were transferred to the new sub-fund along with 58 deferred members.
For the purposes of the allocation of assets and liabilities between the two sub-funds a valuation was carried out on an ongoing funding basis as at 30 November 2003.
This resulted in the new Homeserve sub-fund taking 8m of assets and 0.4m of the deficit leaving the South Staffordshire Water subfund with 113m of assets and 2.5m of the deficit.
The assets will first be allocated to pensioner liabilities and then in proportion to the non-pensioner liabilities.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 Additional disclosures regarding the Groups defined benefit pension scheme are required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement benefits and these are set out below.
The disclosures relate to the fourth year of the transitional provisions.
They provide information which will be necessary for full implementation of FRS 17 in due course.
The actuarial valuation described above has been updated at 31 March 2005 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of FRS 17.
Investments have been valued for this purpose at market value.
