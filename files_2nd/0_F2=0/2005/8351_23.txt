Notes to the consolidated accounts for the year ended 31 December 2005 Basis of preparation note Interserve Plc has prepared consolidated accounts and notes under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Commission.
That is those International Accounting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and related Interpretations SIC-IFRIC interpretations, subsequent amendments to those standards and related interpretations, future standards and related interpretations issued or adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB that have been endorsed by the European Commission.
The directors are not aware of any standards or interpretations that are in issue and not yet effective, and as such have not been applied in these accounts, that will have a material impact on the accounts of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and accounts when the relevant standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
IFRS 1 exemptions IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards sets out the procedures that the Group must follow when it adopts IFRS for the first time as the basis for preparing its consolidated accounts and notes.
The Group is required to establish its IFRS accounting policies as at 31 December 2005 and, in general, apply these retrospectively to determine the IFRS opening balance sheet at its date of transition, 1 January 2004.
This standard provides a number of optional exceptions to this general principle.
The most significant of these are set out below, together with a description in each case of the exception adopted by the Group.
1. Business Combinations that occurred before the opening IFRS balance sheet date IFRS 3 Business Combinations The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations that took place before the date of transition.
As a result, in the opening balance sheet, goodwill arising from past business combinations of 154.3 million remains as stated under UK GAAP at 31 December 2003.
Employee Benefits actuarial gains and losses IAS 19 Employee Benefits The Group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in relation to employee benefit schemes at the date of transition.
The Group has recognised actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they occur in a statement of recognised income and expense in accordance with the amendment to IAS 19, issued on 16 December 2004.
Share-based Payments IFRS 2 Share-based Payment The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2 to all relevant share based payment transactions granted after 7 November 2002.
Financial Instruments IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation The Group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 that enables the Group to only apply these standards from 1 January 2005.
58 Interserve Plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies The financial report has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
Interserve Plc the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
These accounts are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out below.
These accounts and notes have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
During the period the Group adopted IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 that enabled the Group to apply these standards from 1 January 2005 - accordingly comparatives are not restated.
The effect of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39, following the fair valuing of certain of the Groups financial assets and derivatives, is to increase shareholders funds at 1 January 2005 by 5.2 million net of deferred tax.
The particular policies adopted by the directors are set out below.
a Basis of consolidation The Group accounts incorporate the accounts of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included from the effective date of acquisition or until the effective date of disposal respectively.
Profits arising on trading between Group undertakings are excluded.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the accounts of the joint ventures to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
Where a Group company is party to a jointly controlled operation, that company proportionately accounts for its share of the income and expenditure, assets, liabilities and cash flows on a line by line basis.
Such arrangements are reported in the consolidated accounts on the same basis.
b Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition of IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP accounts value subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of shares in associated undertakings is included within investments in associated undertakings.
c Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.
These translation differences are dealt with in the profit for the year.
The financial results and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures are translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange for the year, the balance sheets are translated into sterling at the closing rate of exchange, and the difference arising from the translation of the opening net assets and financial results for the year at closing rate is taken directly to reserves.
Interserve Plc Annual Report 2005 59 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued d Revenue Revenue comprises the fair value of goods and services supplied to external customers and the value of work executed in respect of contracts, excluding VAT.
Revenue from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy on construction contracts see below.
Investment revenue is recognised on an accruals basis.
e Construction contracts Where the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
When the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is probable that it will be recoverable.
Expected losses are recognised immediately.
f Property, plant and equipment Tangible fixed assets are carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Properties in the course of construction are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their expected useful lives.
i Depreciation is provided on a straight line or reducing balance basis at rates ranging between: Straight line Reducing balance Freehold land Nil Freehold buildings 2% to 5% Leasehold property over the period of the lease Plant and equipment 10% to 50% 11.5% to 38% ii Fixed assets leased under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives.
The finance charges are allocated over the primary period of the lease in proportion to the capital element outstanding.
iii The costs of operating leases are charged to the income statement as they accrue.
g Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered impairment loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
h Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
i Borrowing costs Project-specific finance costs are capitalised until the asset becomes operational.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis or the effective interest method as appropriate.
60 Interserve Plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued j Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs are recognised as expenses as incurred, except that directly attributable costs are recognised as an asset when it is virtually certain that a contract will be obtained and the contract is expected to result in future net cash flows.
In the case of PFI bid costs, on financial close of the project the Group recovers bid costs by charging a fee to the relevant project company.
If the fee exceeds the amount held by the Group as an asset, the excess is credited to the balance sheet as deferred income and is released to the income statement over a period appropriate to the risks concerned.
k PFI projects The Group has determined the appropriate treatment of the principal assets of, and income streams from, PFI and similar contracts.
Where the balance of risks and rewards derived from the underlying assets is not borne by the Group, the asset provided is accounted for as a financial asset and is classified as available-for-sale.
Income is recognised on PFI projects both as operating revenue and interest income: a proportion of total cash receivable is allocated to operating revenue by means of a margin on service costs taking account of operational risks, and interest income on the financial asset is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
The residual element is allocated to the amortisation of the financial asset.
During construction the financial assets are carried at fair value which is assumed to be equivalent to cost, plus attributable profit to the extent that this is reasonably certain after making provision for contingencies, less any losses incurred or foreseen in bringing contracts to completion, and less amounts received as progress payments.
Costs for this purpose include valuation of all work done by subcontractors, whether certified or not, and all overheads other than those relating to the general administration of the relevant companies.
Once the project reaches its operational phase, the fair value of the financial asset is measured at each balance sheet date by computing the discounted future value of the cash flow allocated to the financial asset.
The movement in the fair value of the financial asset since the previous balance sheet date is taken to equity.
l Pensions The Groups principal pension scheme for the benefit of permanent members of staff is the Interserve Pension Scheme, which is both of the defined benefit and defined contribution type.
For defined benefit schemes the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount recognised in the income statement is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes during the year.
m Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences which arise on the difference between the carrying value of an asset or liability and the tax base of the same item.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable they will be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Interserve Plc Annual Report 2005 61 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued n Financial instruments Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are measured at fair value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Transactions in derivative financial instruments are for risk management purposes only.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk.
To the extent that such instruments are matched to underlying assets or liabilities, they are accounted for using hedge accounting.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows and net investments are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had been previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, or have not been designated as hedges, are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their economic risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised directly in equity, until the asset is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period.
From 1 January 2005 onwards, assets constructed by PFI concession companies are classified as available-for-sale financial assets.
o Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2004.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model.

Goodwill continued The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and margins during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using post-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on current Board approved budgets and forecasts and are extrapolated based on expectations of future changes in the market these growth rates vary between 2 per cent and 10 per cent per annum.
The Group produces 3-year plans and these are extrapolated for a further 17 years reflecting the long-term nature of the investments.
The rate used to discount the future cash flows is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital 8.2 per cent as adjusted for the specific risk profile of each division.

No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The Group had an interest rate cap hedging interest rate exposure on 20 million at 31 December 2005.
The strike price for the cap has not been triggered, whilst this remains the case fair value adjustments relating to the cap are accounted for through the income statement.
The fair value of this cap at 31 December 2005 was nil 2004: 0.1 million.

Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

Unsecured loan notes 2005 2004 million million Floating rate loan notes 2.2 3.9 The floating rate unsecured loan notes are redeemable at par by the noteholder giving not less than 30 days prior notice in writing to expire on or before any interest payment date.
Unless redeemed earlier, repayment will be made on 1 July 2008.
Interest is payable half-yearly on the loan notes at rates ranging between 0.5 per cent and 1.3 per cent below six-month LIBOR.
Derivative financial instruments a Currency exposures Gains and losses relating to monetary assets and liabilities of Group companies that are not denominated in their functional currency will be recognised in the income statement.
Taking into account the effect of forward contracts, Group companies did not have a material exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 31 December 2005.
Gains and losses arising on the re-translation of overseas net assets are recognised directly in equity.
Loans held by Interserve Plc denominated in the currency of the foreign operations are designated as hedging instruments in a net investment hedge.
Hedges were in place at the year end to hedge the translation exposure on 19.8 million of net assets in order to protect Group consolidated net worth.
Where these hedges were effective, gains and losses arising on the re-translation of these hedges were also recognised directly in equity.
b Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities For the whole Group, financial assets and liabilities have fair values not materially different to the carrying values.
c Market price risk The Group seeks to control its exposures to changes in interest rates by limiting their impact on the interest charge in the income statement.
This is achieved through the use of interest rate caps where appropriate.
An instantaneous 1 per cent increase across all relevant interest rates would increase the Groups interest charge by less than 0.5 per cent of consolidated Group profits before before tax.
d Gains and losses on hedges The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to eliminate the currency exposure that arises on sales or purchases denominated in foreign currencies immediately those sales or purchases are contracted.
It also uses interest rate derivatives to manage the interest rate profile.
Changes in the fair value of instruments which are effective as hedges are recognised directly in equity.
Gains or losses on hedges held within joint venture entities that were recognised in equity during the year amounted to 4.0 million net of deferred tax 2004: nil.
There were no unrecognised gains or losses on hedges at 31 December 2005 2004: nil.

The average lease term is three to four years.
For the year ended 31 December 2005, the average effective borrowing rate was 6.35 per cent.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
All lease obligations are denominated in sterling.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates their carrying amount.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.

The vesting period is generally three years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options lapse.
Furthermore, options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.

Retirement benefit schemes The principal pension schemes within the Group have been valued for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
For each of these pension schemes valuation information has been updated by Lane Clark & Peacock LLP, qualified independent actuaries, to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the various schemes as at 31 December 2005.
As permitted by IAS 19, actuarial gains and losses are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the various defined benefit obligations, as reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
The following table sets out the key IAS 19 assumptions used to assess the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
Assumptions: 2005 2004 Retail price inflation 2.6% pa 2.9% pa Discount rate 4.9% pa 5.5% pa Pension increases in payment: LPI RPI 2.5% 2.6% 2.7% 2.9% Fixed 5% 5.00% 5.00% 3% or RPI if higher capped at 5% 3.30% 3.70% General salary increases 3.35 4.1% pa 3.65 4.4% pa 82 Interserve Plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 29.
Retirement benefit schemes continued The expected rate of return on assets for the financial year ending 31 December 2005 was 7.6 per cent pa 2004: 7.7 per cent.
The rate is derived by taking the weighted average of the longterm expected rate of return on each of the asset classes that the pension schemes were invested in at 31 December 2005.
For 2005 a deduction of 0.3 per cent was then made from the expected return on assets for the expenses incurred in running the schemes where these were not met separately.
The postretirement mortality assumption used to value the benefit obligation allows for future improvements in mortality and implies for the majority of the obligation that associated with the Interserve Pension Scheme that a 65-year-old current pensioner is expected to live until age: male 84.0 2004: age 82.6 and female 86.9 2004: age 85.6.
A future pensioner who is aged 65 in 2025 is expected to live until age: male 85.1 2004: age 84.0 and female 87.9 2004: age 86.9.
The amount included in the balance sheet arising from the Groups obligations in respect of the various pension schemes is as follows: 2005 2004 million million Present value of defined benefit obligation 514.6 440.5 Fair value of scheme assets 382.0 311.6 Liability recognised in the balance sheet 132.6 128.9 The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2005 2004 million million Employers part of current service cost 9.6 10.4 Interest cost 24.2 22.6 Expected return on scheme assets 22.8 21.2 Total expense recognised in profit and loss 11.0 11.8 The actual return on scheme assets over the year was 65.5 million 2004: 32.9 million.

Explanation of transition to IFRS This is the first year that the Group has presented its accounts and notes under IFRS.
The following disclosures are required in the year of transition.
The last accounts and notes under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 December 2004 and the date of transition to IFRS was therefore 1 January 2004.
Reconciliation of equity at 1 January 2004 date of transition to IFRS UK GAAP Effect of transition to IFRS IFRS IAS 19 IAS 10 IAS 39 IAS 12 Reclass million million million million million million million Note i ii iii iv Goodwill 154.3 154.3 Property, plant and equipment 90.1 90.1 Associates and joint ventures 32.8 32.8 Deferred tax 38.3 8.0 30.3 Total noncurrent assets 277.2 38.3 8.0 307.5 Pension scheme 33.2 33.2 Inventories 12.5 12.5 Trade and other receivables 244.6 244.6 Cash and deposits 36.0 36.0 Total current assets 326.3 33.2 293.1 Total assets 603.5 5.1 8.0 600.6 Trade and other payables 316.8 10.6 306.2 Bank loans and overdrafts 52.0 52.0 Unsecured loan notes 6.1 6.1 Pension scheme 127.5 127.5 Provisions 24.8 24.8 Deferred tax liability 15.9 9.9 2.0 8.0 Total liabilities 415.6 117.6 10.6 2.0 8.0 516.6 Total assets less total liabilities 187.9 112.5 10.6 2.0 84.0 Issued capital 11.4 11.4 Share premium account 107.9 107.9 Capital redemption reserve 0.1 0.1 Merger reserve 16.4 16.4 Hedging reserve Own shares 0.5 0.5 Retained earnings 51.9 112.5 10.6 2.0 52.0 Minority interest 0.7 0.7 Total equity 187.9 112.5 10.6 2.0 84.0 Notes to the reconciliation of equity at 1 January 2004 i The Group has adopted IAS 19 Employee Benefits in respect of its defined benefit pension schemes.
The balance sheet impact of the implementation of this standard is to recognise a pension liability of 127.5 million in the Groups opening IFRS balance sheet in place of the 33.2 million SSAP 24 prepayment previously held under UK GAAP.
Net of the deferred tax associated with both of these balances, the net impact is to reduce consolidated net assets by 112.5 million.
ii As required by IAS 10 Events After the Balance Sheet Date no provision is made within the opening IFRS balance sheet for the final proposed dividend for 2003 because at the balance sheet date it was still subject to approval and is thus not considered to be an adjusting event.
The result is a 10.6 million increase in reported net assets due to the nonprovision for the 2003 final proposed dividend.
iii As permitted by IFRS 1 the Group has decided to apply UK GAAP in the comparative information in relation to financial instruments within the scope of IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Had the comparative information been prepared in full compliance with IAS 32 and IAS 39, the main adjustment would have been to the share of reserves consolidated in respect of PFI Joint Venture arrangements reflecting the fair value of availableforsale financial assets and interest rate swaps entered into within these special purpose companies.
This would result in a net increase in the net asset carrying value for these investments and an equal increase in consolidated reserves.
iv IAS 12 Income Taxes requires that a deferred tax liability be recognised for all noncontrollable taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates.
The Group has thus provided a deferred tax liability for the additional tax that would arise on the distribution of reserves held by its overseas associates.
It is estimated that at 1 January 2004 this would amount to 2.0 million and this is the consequent reduction in Group net assets.
Interserve Plc Annual Report 2005 85 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued Reconciliation of profit or loss for the year to 31 December 2004 UK GAAP Effect of transition to IFRS IFRS IAS 19 IFRS 3 IFRS 2 IAS 28 31 IAS 12 million million million million million million million Note iii iii iv v Revenue 1,238.2 1,238.2 Cost of sales 1,098.0 1,098.0 Gross Profit 140.2 140.2 Distribution costs 24.8 24.8 Administrative expenses 85.7 2.4 9.5 0.2 78.8 Other operating income 0.1 0.1 Share of associates and joint ventures 5.6 0.1 1.2 4.5 Profit on disposal of investment 1.9 1.9 Profit on disposal of properties 0.3 0.3 Profit from operations 37.6 2.4 9.6 0.2 1.2 43.4 Investment revenue 13.5 21.2 9.9 24.8 Finance costs 15.1 22.6 10.9 26.8 Profit before tax 36.0 3.8 9.6 0.2 0.2 41.4 Tax expense 13.3 1.2 0.2 0.2 12.1 Net profit loss 22.7 2.6 9.6 0.2 0.2 29.3 Notes to the reconciliation of profit or loss for the year to 31 December 2004 i IAS 19 Employee Benefits requires separate recognition of the operating and finance costs of defined benefit pension schemes in the income statement.
Any variations due to actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The impact of the transition to IFRS in 2004 is an additional charge of 2.4 million to profit from operations with a further 1.4 million charge to net interest and a related tax credit of 1.2 million.
The actuarial loss for the year of 2.1 million net of deferred tax of 0.6 million is taken directly to reserves.
ii IFRS 3 no longer permits the amortisation of goodwill.
Instead goodwill is carried at cost and is subject to regular impairment reviews.
Interserve has chosen, under the transitional arrangements of IFRS 1, to apply IFRS 3 prospectively from the transition date.
Hence all prior business combination accounting is frozen at the transition date and the value of goodwill is frozen at 1 January 2004 and amortisation previously reported under UK GAAP for 2004 is reversed for IFRS statements.
The impact in 2004 is a reduction in the amortisation charge of 9.6 million.
There are no associated tax impacts.
iii As required by IFRS 2 ShareBased Payment a charge of 0.2 million has been made to profit from operations recognising the fair value of outstanding share options granted since 7 November 2002.
The fair value has been calculated using the BlackScholes options valuation model and is charged to income over the relevant vesting periods, adjusted to reflect actual and expected levels of vesting.
There is no impact on net assets as a result of this charge.
iv As allowed within IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures Interserve has opted to equity account for its interests in joint ventures.
Whilst this is a continuation of the equity accounting adopted under UK GAAP, there is a presentational change under IFRS that requires the presentation of the net result after tax as part of the profit from operations.
There is no net profit impact but the result is to reduce Profit from Operations by 1.2 million, Finance Income by 9.9 million and Finance Costs by 10.9 million.
Tax expense reduces by 0.2 million.
v IAS 12 Income Taxes requires that a deferred tax liability be recognised for all noncontrollable taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates.
It is estimated that this would amount to a further 0.2 million on additional reserves accumulated during the year and this is the consequent reduction in Group net assets.

The balance sheet impact of the implementation of this standard is to recognise a pension liability of 128.9 million in the Groups IFRS balance sheet as at 31 December 2004 in place of the 37.7 million SSAP 24 prepayment previously held under UK GAAP.
Net of the deferred tax associated with both of these balances, the net impact is to reduce consolidated net assets by 116.6 million.
Consequently consolidated net assets increase by 9.6 million from those reported under UK GAAP.
iii As required by IAS 10 Events After the Balance Sheet Date no provision is made within these accounts for the final proposed dividend because at the balance sheet date it was still subject to approval and is thus not considered to be an adjusting event.
The result is an 11.0 million increase in reported net assets due to the nonprovision for the 2004 final proposed dividend.

It is estimated that at 31 December 2004 this would amount to 2.2 million and this is the consequent reduction in Group net assets.
