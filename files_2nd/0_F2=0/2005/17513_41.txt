Xstrata plc Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP has two elements: i A contingent award of free ordinary shares that vests after three years, subject to, and to the extent that, performance criteria determined at the time of grant have been satisfied: and ii A share option to acquire ordinary shares at a specified exercise price after the third anniversary of grant, subject to, and to the extent that, performance criteria determined at the time of grant have been satisfied.
No consideration will be payable on the vesting of an LTIP award of free ordinary shares.
On exercise of an option, a participant will be required to pay an exercise price which will not be less than the market value of an ordinary share on the date of grant.
Of the below options, 1.6 million options 2004: 1.4 million are accounted for as cash-settled share-based payments, whilst the remainder of the LTIP awards granted after 7 November 2002 are accounted for as equity-settled awards.

Share-based Payments continued The fair value of the share-based compensation plans including free shares and options are estimated using a binomial model at the date of grant and the fair value is updated at 31 December for a limited number of options that are permitted to be cash-settled.
The main weighted average assumptions used are: Date of Date of grant 31 December grant 31 December 2005 2005 2004 2004 Dividend yield % 3.14 3.16 3.25 3.23 Expected volatility % 31.18 29.25 37.57 36.19 Risk-free interest rate % 4.86 4.18 4.78 4.52 Earliest exercise date 11 Mar 2008 11 Mar 2008 4 Mar 2007 4 Mar 2007 Latest exercise date 10 Mar 2015 10 Mar 2015 4 Mar 2014 4 Mar 2014 Expected exercise date 10 Sep 2011 10 Sep 2011 4 Sep 2010 4 Sep 2010 Share price at date of grant GBP 10.48 10.48 7.33 7.33 Exercise price GBP 10.60 10.60 7.35 7.35 Free share fair value at date of grant GBP 9.54 9.54 6.37 6.37 Option fair value at date of grant GBP 3.05 3.05 2.34 2.34 The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historic volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The amount of 2004 and 2005 LTIP awards that vest are subject to the satisfaction of certain performance criteria being met over a three-year performance period.
Half of the options and Free Share Awards are conditional on Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to a peer group and half are conditional on the Groups real cost savings relative to targets set on a stretching scale over the three-year period.
For the awards conditional on TSR, 25% of the combined award will vest if TSR growth is at the median of the specified peer group, the full 50% of the combined award will vest for performance at or above the second decile with straight line vesting between these points.
No vesting will occur for below median performance.
For the remaining award, vesting is conditional on the Groups real cost savings relative to targets set on a stretching scale: 5% of the combined award will vest for 1% cost savings, 35% for 2% cost savings and 50% for 3% or more cost savings, with straight line vesting between these points.
No vesting will occur if cost savings are less than 1%.
Real cost savings will be measured in relation to operating costs after adjusting for the effects of inflation, excluding depreciation, commodity price linked costs, effects of currencies on translation of local currency costs and planned life of mine adjustments.
The 2003 LTIP awards are only subject to the TSR performance criteria.
No other features of the LTIP awards were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.

Deferred Bonus As detailed within the Remuneration Report on pages 102 to 115 of the Annual Review 2005, the maximum bonus payable under the Bonus Plan for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee is 300% of salary.
Bonuses are payable in three tranches as follows: the maximum bonus, which any one participant is eligible to receive in cash, will be limited to 100% of the individuals base salary: any additional bonus up to a further 100% of base salary will be deferred for a period of one year: and any remaining bonus will be deferred for a period of two years.
The deferred elements will take the form of awards of Xstrata shares conditional on the participant remaining in employment throughout the deferral period.
The number of shares awarded will be determined by reference to the market value of the shares at the date the bonus payment is determined.
The deferred element has been treated as an equity-settled share-based payment in accordance with FRS 20.
In 2005 the Xstrata Remuneration Committee resolved that during the bonus deferral period dividend equivalents would accrue in relation to the deferral, to be delivered at the end of the deferral period and subject to the deferral award vesting.
As dividend equivalents are receivable on the deferred amounts, the fair value of the deferral is technically equal to the value of the bonuses deferred.
The total value of 2005 bonuses deferred was US$7.5 million 2004 US$5.4 million or 258,242 shares 2004 271,987 shares.
Directors Added Value Plan AVP The first cycle of the AVP began on 9 May 2005.
A description of the performance requirements and the vesting schedule of the plan are detailed within the Remuneration Report on pages 102 to 115 of the Annual Review 2005.
The fair value of the equity-settled share-based payment under FRS 20 was US$6.9 million, estimated at 9 May 2005, using a Monte Carlo simulation model to incorporate the market based features of the plan.
