25 Financial instruments Details of managements policies for controlling the risks associated with financial instruments, including policies on matters such as hedging of risk exposures and avoiding undue concentrations of credit risk are given in the section on Financial Risk Management on pages 51 and 52.
Derivative financial instruments The group adopted IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 January 2004.
However, the group only achieved hedge accounting from 1 January 2005 when the hedge documentation requirements of IAS 39 were in place.
Interest rate risk At 31 December 2005, the group held interest rate swaps covering unsecured oating rate bank borrowings of 412 million, effectively xing the associated cost of interest at rates between 4.01% and 6.43%.
In addition, the group held caps and collars covering a further 70 million in total, tranches of which are allowed to oat at rates between oors of 4.25% and 5.00% and caps of between 4.75% and 6.25%.
The groups caps and collars are not designated as hedging instruments, however all of the groups interest rate swaps, were designated as cash ow hedges from 1 January 2005.
The gains and losses deferred in equity will be recorded in the income statement during the next 10 years being the lives of the instruments.
In anticipation of raising additional funds around the year end, the group entered into a pre-hedge arrangement during the first half of 2005.
This enabled the group to lock into the interest rates on offer at that time, avoiding the risks of rate movements up to the date the funding would be agreed.
Funding, by way of a US Private Placing, was subsequently negotiated in December 2005 with the funds being made available on 1 February 2006.
To the extent that it is effective, the value of the pre-hedge can be deferred in the balance sheet and recorded in the income statement over the life of the funding.
Foreign currency risk All foreign currency denominated borrowings are immediately swapped into Sterling at the commencement of the facility agreement and, hence, the group is not exposed to currency rate uctuations.
The groups cross-currency swaps were designated as fair value hedges to hedge against interest and foreign currency risk from 1 January 2005.
As a consequence, the change in the fair values of these swaps are recorded in the income statement within finance costs, together with the change in the fair value of the US Dollar denominated Private Placing which the swaps have hedged.

Fair values of non-derivative financial instruments The following table summarises the carrying values and fair values of those financial assets and liabilities not recognised in the balance sheet of the group and company at fair value: 2005 2004 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair value value value value Group 000 000 000 000 Loans and receivables 1,673,712 1,673,712 1,484,232 1,481,832 Bank borrowings 709,628 713,872 583,602 587,226 Debenture loans and other borrowings 634,950 661,285 631,693 624,107 Obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts 6,048 6,048 5,700 5,700 Company Intra-group loans and receivables 1,558,429 1,558,429 1,530,497 1,530,497 Bank borrowings 709,628 713,872 583,602 586,685 Debenture loans and other borrowings 630,336 656,652 626,433 618,823 Obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts 220 220 400 400 Intra-group borrowings 29,804 29,804 156,821 156,821 The fair value of loans and receivables is shown as their carrying value, except for the loans and receivables of Cattles Commercial as at 31 December 2004 whose fair value equates to the value at which the receivables were sold in January 2005 after adjusting for the deferred consideration provision.
The carrying value of loans and receivables and, hence, the fair value represents the discounted amount of estimated future cash ows expected to be received.
The discount rate used is the original EIR, which is consistent with the rates on new loans being written.
The fair values of bank borrowings, debenture loans and other borrowings are calculated by discounting expected future cash ows at appropriate market interest rates prevailing at each balance sheet date and at estimated future exchange rates.
The fair value of obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts equates to their carrying values as the interest rates being paid on these obligations are substantially the same as those prevailing in the current open market.
The fair values of intra-group loans and receivables and borrowings equates to their carrying values as the interest rates being earned and charged on these items are based upon prevailing market rates.
The carrying values of trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts and trade and other payables approximate to fair value due to their relatively short maturity and are not shown in the above table.

The weighted average effective interest rate on the groups cash and bank overdraft are based on the prevailing UK base rate less 0.5% and plus 1% respectively.
The weighted average effective interest rates in relation to the companys financial assets and liabilities are the same of those of the group, except for loans and receivables which was 7.0% at 31 December 2005 2004: 7.3%.
Bank facilities The committed bank facilities available to the group, all of which are at oating interest rates, at 31 December 2005 were: Total Undrawn facility facility Type Maturity period Established 000 000 Overdraft Renewable annually 13,350 6,805 Syndicate July 2006 2001 100,000 48,000 Syndicate July 2006 2003 154,000 Syndicate July 2008 2003 139,000 91,000 Syndicate July 2009 2004 500,000 113,000 Bilateral July 2011 2004 75,000 15,000 Loan April 2012 2005 9,408 990,758 273,805 Utilisation from each syndicated facility is by money market renewable term loans or acceptances which are rolled over in one year or less.
The company uses a number of banks and syndicates to provide finance to avoid an unnecessary concentration of borrowing.
Principal covenants The group must comply with principal lending covenants in respect of the ratio of total borrowings to tangible net worth and the ratio of profit before interest and tax to net interest payable.
At 31 December 2005 neither of these covenants had been breached.
