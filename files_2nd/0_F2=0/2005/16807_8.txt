Performance | 51 793529 1110 3 6 05 10:40 Page 52 Non-GAAP Information Cash ow measures In presenting and discussing the Groups reported results, free cash ow and operating free cash ow are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with UK GAAP.
The Group believes that it is both useful and necessary to communicate free cash ow to investors and other interested parties, for the following reasons: free cash ow allows the Company and external parties to evaluate the Groups liquidity and the cash generated by the Groups operations.
Free cash ow does not include items determined independently of the ongoing business, such as the level of dividends, and items which are deemed discretionary, such as cash ows relating to acquisitions and disposals or nancing activities.
In addition, it does not necessarily reect the amounts which the Group has an obligation to incur.
However, it does reect the cash available for such discretionary activities, to strengthen the balance sheet or to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends or share purchases: free cash ow facilitates comparability of results with other companies, although the Groups measure of free cash ow may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies: it is used by management for planning, reporting and incentive purposes: and it is useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community and the debt rating agencies.
The Group believes that the presentation of operating free cash ow is useful and necessary for investors and other interested parties as it provides the quantitative basis for the cash ow targets of the One Vodafone initiatives outlined on page 13.
This measure may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
A reconciliation of net cash inow from operating activities, the closest equivalent GAAP measure, to free cash ow and operating free cash ow, is shown below: Years ended 31 March 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 m m m m m Net cash inow from operating activities 12,713 12,317 11,142 8,102 4,587 Purchase of intangible xed assets 59 21 99 325 13,163 Purchase of tangible xed assets 4,890 4,508 5,289 4,145 3,698 Disposal of tangible xed assets 70 158 109 75 275 Operating free cash ow 7,834 7,946 5,863 3,707 11,999 Dividends received from joint ventures and associated undertakings 2,020 1,801 742 139 353 Taxation 1,616 1,182 883 545 1,585 Net cash outow for returns on investments and servicing of finance 391 44 551 936 47 Free cash ow 7,847 8,521 5,171 2,365 13,278 Organic growth The Group believes that organic growth, which is not intended to be a substitute, or superior to, reported growth, provides useful and necessary information to investors and other interested parties for the following reasons: it provides additional information on underlying growth of the business without the effect of factors unrelated to the operating performance of the business: it is used by the Group for internal performance analysis: and it facilities comparability of underlying growth with other companies, although the term organic is not a dened term under UK or US GAAP, and may not, therefore, be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

The Group believes that it is both useful and necessary to report these measures for the following reasons: these measures are used by the Group for internal performance analysis: the presentation by the Groups reported business segments of these measures facilitates comparability with other companies, although the Groups measures may not be comparable with similarly titled profit measurements reported by other companies: and it is useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community and debt rating agencies.
Reconciliation of these measures to the closest equivalent GAAP measure, Total Group operating loss, is provided in note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Presentation of other revenue in discussion of trading results The discussion of the trading results of the Group and principal markets on pages 33 to 44 presents the cost of sales related to acquisition and retention costs net of revenue attributable to these activities.
The Group believes that this basis of presentation provides useful information for investors for the following reasons: it provides trends in net subsidies with respect to the acquisition and retention of customers: and it facilitates comparability of results with other companies operating in the mobile telecommunications business.
This performance indicator is commonly used in the mobile telecommunications industry and by Vodafone management to compare net subsidies provided to acquire and retain customers to prior periods and internal forecasts.
Net other revenue, Net acquisition costs and Net retention costs as used in the trading results are dened on page 29.
