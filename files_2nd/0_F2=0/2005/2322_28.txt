Brands acquired by the company or by its subsidiaries, namely Clearasil and Dobendan and its derivatives are well known and well positioned in their markets and Boots Healthcare International BHI plans to improve this position from a programme of continued investment.
BHI have therefore concluded that these brands have an indefinite useful economic life and they are not being amortised.
As a consequence, an annual impairment review is undertaken.
The valuation of these brands is in excess of latest carrying value of 248.7m.
The majority of the other product rights are where the group has a licence to market other peoples brands in specific countries.
