Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 1.
General information Johnston Press is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given on the back page.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 4 and in the Chief Executive Officers Review and the Financial Review on pages 12 to 23.
Application of IFRS 1 The Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 are the first financial statements to be prepared in accordance with IFRS.
These financial statements have been prepared as described in notes 1 and 2 including the principles set out in IFRS 1.
Under the first time adoption procedures set out in IFRS 1, the Group is required to establish its IFRS accounting policies as at 1 January 2005 and to apply these retrospectively in the determination of prior period comparatives from 1 January 2004, the date of transition.
There are a number of optional exemptions to this general principle, the most significant of which are set out below.
IFRS 3, Business Combinations The Group has elected not to restate business combinations prior to the date of transition.
IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment The Group has elected, where appropriate, to use book values at the date of transition as the deemed cost of plant, property and equipment.
Consequently any historic asset revaluations will not be updated.
IAS 19, Employee Benefits The Group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in relation to employee benefit schemes at the date of transition.
In subsequent periods all actuarial gains and losses will be recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Group statement of recognised income and expense.
IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement The Group has elected to adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005 and not to restate prior period comparatives.
Consequently the comparative financial information in respect of financial instruments is presented in accordance with UK GAAP.
Preference shares qualify as equity with effect from 1 January 2005.
IFRS 2, Share-Based Payments The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2 to all share-based awards and options granted post 7 November 2002 but not vested at 31 December 2004.
Tables setting out the reconciliation of opening UK GAAP balances to IFRS, together with the effect on the Groups equity, net income and cash flows, are provided in note 34.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a lease IFRIC 5 Right to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when the relevant standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 59 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 - continued 2.
Significant Accounting Policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for the first time.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 34.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain properties and financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Group income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, including publishing titles, are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discounted Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Investments Listed investments are shown as available for sale, initially recorded at cost in the period of acquisition and subsequently measured at fair value.
Gains and losses on the fair value of available for sale investments are recognised in equity.
On disposal or impairment of the investment, all relevant gains and losses are included in the income statement.
Other investments are shown at cost less provisions for impairment, except for investments in associates.
In the Group financial statements, investments in associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method and therefore the Group financial statements include the Groups share of the profit and net assets of associates.
Publishing titles The Groups principal intangible assets are publishing titles.
The Group does not capitalise internally generated goodwill or publishing titles.
Titles separately acquired after 1 January 1989 are stated at cost and titles owned by subsidiaries acquired after 1 January 1996 are recorded at directors valuation at the date of acquisition.
These publishing titles have no finite life and consequently are not amortised.
Every six months impairment tests are undertaken, as outlined with goodwill, to determine any diminution in the recoverable amount below carrying value.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
Any impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
60 Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least every six months.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment every six months, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit, second to the value of publishing titles and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Advertising revenue is recognised on publication and circulation revenue is recognised at the point of sale.
Printing revenue is recognised when the service is provided.
The Group prepares financial statements to complete publishing weeks and once every five or six years the trading in a year comprises 53 weeks.
2005 was a 52 week trading year compared to 53 weeks in 2004.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups hedging and translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.

Significant Accounting Policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment balances are shown at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
In certain cases the amounts of previous revaluations of properties conducted in 1996 or 1997 or the fair value of the property at the date of the acquisition by the Group have been treated as the deemed cost on transition to IFRSs.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, excluding land, at varying rates calculated to write-off cost over the useful lives.
The principal rates employed are: Heritable and freehold property excluding land 2.5% on written down value Leasehold land and buildings equal annual instalments over lease term Web offset presses excluding press components 5% straight line basis Pre-press systems 20% straight line basis Other plant and machinery 15% on written down value 6.67%, 10%, 20%, 25% and 33% straight line basis Motor vehicles 25% straight line basis Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value as follows: Cost incurred in bringing materials to their present location and condition comprises: a raw materials and goods for resale at purchase cost on a first-in first-out basis: and b work in progress at cost of direct materials, labour and certain overheads.
Net realisable value comprises selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
Assets held under the finance leases are capitalised within property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the Income Statement over the period of the leases on the effective interest method.
All other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Development grants Development grants for revenue expenditure are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs and are deducted in reporting the related expense.
Grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the Income Statement over the expected useful lives of the related assets.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring or other non-recurring costs and after the share of the results of associates but before investment income and finance costs.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of that instrument.
The Groups activities and funding structure give rise to some exposure to the financial risks of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the Income Statement as they arise.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the Income Statement.
62 Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Borrowings Interest-bearing loans and bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premia payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are charged to the Income Statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
On transition to IFRS, a deferred tax liability has been recorded in respect of publishing titles and properties that do not qualify for any tax allowances that were acquired through business combinations.
Given that the Group has elected, under IFRS 1, not to restate pretransition business combinations under IFRS 3, this pre-transition deferred tax element has been charged against retained earnings.
Any such fair value on future business combinations will form part of the goodwill on acquisition and both the goodwill and related deferred tax liability will be included in any impairment test in relation to the relevant cash generating unit.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the relevant requirements of IAS12 are satisfied.
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 63 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 - continued 2.
Significant Accounting Policies continued Retirement benefit costs The Group provides pensions to employees through various schemes.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged to the Income Statement as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the Income Statement and presented in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity settled share-based benefits to certain employees.
Subject to the transition arrangements set out above, these share-based payments are measured at their fair value at the date of grant and the fair value of expected shares is expensed to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes model, as amended to take account of the Directors best estimate of probable share vesting and exercise.
Dividends Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recorded as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved.
In the Companys financial statements, dividends receivable from subsidiaries are recognised as assets in the period in which the dividends are approved.
Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty Critical judgements in applying the groups accounting policies In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 2, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below.
Deferred tax balances on publishing titles and properties not eligible for tax allowances Deferred tax amounting to 369,730,000 at 31 December 2005 2004 - 283,595,000, has been provided pursuant to IAS 12 Income Taxes on the values of the publishing titles in the Groups balance sheet and the value of properties that are not eligible for tax allowances.
Management has considered it appropriate to provide this balance in order to comply with the technical requirements of IAS 12 despite the fact that management cannot foresee any circumstances in which such a tax liability would arise.
Management has no intention at the present time to dispose of any of the assets concerned but even if such a decision was to be taken at some future date, it is unlikely that the titles or properties would be sold separately from the legal entities that own the assets.
As such, management is confident that this tax provision will never be required to be paid.
Representations have been made to the IASB on this matter, but in the meantime the deferred tax balance has been provided in order to comply with the standard.
64 Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 3.
Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty continued Valuation of publishing titles on acquisition During the year the Group completed the acquisitions described in note 28.
The Groups policies require that a fair value at the date of acquisition be attributed to the publishing titles owned by each acquired entity.
The Groups management uses its judgement to determine the fair value attributable to each acquired publishing title taking into account the consideration paid, the earnings history and potential of the title, any recent similar transactions, industry statistics such as average earnings multiples and any other relevant factors.
The fair values attributed to the titles acquired in 2005 are set out in note 28 and these values will be reviewed for impairment at a minimum twice annually in the future.
Valuation of share-based payments The Group estimates the expected value of share-based payments and this is charged through the Income Statement over the vesting periods of the relevant payments.
The cost is estimated using a Black Scholes valuation model.
The Black Scholes calculations are based on a number of assumptions that are set out in note 31 and are amended to take account of estimated levels of share vesting and exercise.
This method of estimating the value of the share-based payments is intended to ensure that the actual value transferred to employees is provided in the share-based payments reserve by the time the payments are made.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and publishing titles Determining whether goodwill or publishing titles are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which these assets are allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the Group to identify appropriate cash generating units, to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from each cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amount of goodwill was 101,635,000 at 31 December 2005 and the carrying amount of publishing titles was 1,213,186,000 at the same date.
No impairment losses have been identified or provided.
Details of the impairment reviews that the Group performs are provided in note 14.
Valuation of pension liabilities The Group records in its balance sheet a liability equivalent to the deficit on the Groups defined benefit pension schemes.
This liability is determined with advice from the Groups actuarial advisers each year and can fluctuate based on a number factors some of which are out-with the control of management.
The main factors that can impact the valuation include: the discount rate used to discount future liabilities back to the present date.
This is determined each year based on the yield on corporate bonds the actual returns on investments experienced as compared to the expected rates used in the previous pension scheme valuation the actual rates of salary and pension increase as compared to the expected rates used in the previous valuation mortality assumptions.
Details of the assumptions used to determine the liability at 31 December 2005 are set out in note 23.
Bad debts provisions The trade debtors balances recorded in the Groups balance sheet comprise large numbers of comparatively small balances.
The Groups policy is that all debts over 90 days are provided in a doubtful debts provision unless local conditions determine otherwise.
At the end of each half year local management undertake a full line by line review of all trade debtors.
The judgements made locally are also reviewed by the Groups senior financial management.
Whilst every attempt is made to ensure that the bad debts provisions are as accurate as possible, there remains a risk that the provisions may not match the level of debts which ultimately prove to be uncollectible.
4. Business and Geographical Segments For management purposes the Group has two business segments, newspaper publishing in print and online and contract printing.
The business operates in two geographical segments which are the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.
Revenue and the carrying value of assets in the Republic of Ireland are less than 10 per cent in the current year and so have not been disclosed seperately.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following 20 years based on estimated growth rates that do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
No residual value or perpetuity factor is currently assumed in the value of these calculations.

An allowance has been made for the estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods and services of 7,517,000 2004 - 6,360,000.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Group with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Credit Risk The Groups principal assets subject to credit risk are bank balances and cash, trade and other debtors and investments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade debtors.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debtors.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

In the early part of 2006 additional hedge arrangements were entered into totalling 150 million.
Other borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Directors estimate that the fair value of the Groups borrowings is not significantly different from the balance sheet values for all borrowings except the US dollar denominated 10 year senior notes.
The directors estimate that the fair value of this debt was 66,829,000 which is 5,956,000 less than the value shown in the balance sheet 2004 - 58,255,000 which was 14,530,000 less than the value shown in the balance sheet.
The floating rate overdrafts and loans bear interest at Libor plus or minus an agreed margin fixed at maturity intervals which can be monthly, quarterly or half yearly.
The margin is based on the following: a Overdraft 1% above Libor b Loan Stock 1999 2006 0.5% c Loan stock 2000 2010 Libor d Revolving Credit Facilities.
1% above Libor with adjustments dependent on financial ratios.
The hedging arrangements described in note 22 all relate to the Revolving Credit Facility and the Private Placement of 10 Year Senior Notes.
They were a requirement of the Revolving Credit Facility.
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 77 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 - continued 21.
Borrowings continued At 31 December 2005, the Group had Revolving Credit Facilities of 550 million with a number of banks maturing in 2010, together with a 30 million overdraft facility and a Private Placement of 10 year Senior Notes amounting to 133 million.
The undrawn element of the Facilities at 31 December 2005 amounted to 45 million.
The Loan Stock 1999 2006 is part of the 550 million Revolving Credit Facilities and any redemptions over 1 million are funded from additional drawdowns from the Term Loan Facility.
The Private Placement of Senior Notes is made up of 60 million at a fixed rate of 6.3% and $115 million at a fixed rate of 5.75% maturing in 2013.
Using hedging agreements, the latter tranche was swapped back into floating sterling to ensure the Group has no exposure to interest rates outside the UK.
In addition, the Group had negotiated temporary facilities of 160 million to purchase The Scotsman Publications Ltd, which completed on 4 January 2006.
The term of this facility is six months and it will be replaced by permanent facilities in the first half of 2006.
Derivative Financial Instruments Adoption of IAS 32 & 39 IAS 32 & 39 were adopted by the Group on 1 January 2005.
The foreign exchange element of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is now presented and measured separately from the private placement loans to which they relate.
The Group has elected not to restate comparative periods and so comparative periods are disclosed and measured based on UK GAAP.
The Group has applied hedge accounting in accordance with the provisions of IAS 39.

The Group is a party to a number of foreign currency forward contracts and options in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups overseas subsidiaries and in US dollars in order to hedge the risks associated with the US dollar denominated senior loan notes.
At the balance sheet date, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed are as below: 2005 2004 000 000 Forward foreign exchange contracts 72,785 72,785 78 Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 22.
Derivative Financial Instruments continued In addition, the Group had options to purchase Euros and Swiss francs equivalent to amounts of approximately 10,211,000 and 4,132,000 as hedges against exchange losses on future purchases of plant.
The hedging arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures related to the senior loan notes and other commitments that exist at 31 December 2005.
The arrangements are regularly reviewed and updated as required.
At 31 December 2005 the fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be a liability of approximately 7,566,000 2004 - liability of 14,530,000.
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of currency derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges amounting to 7,566,000 2004 - liability of 14,530,000 has been recognised directly in equity.
No amounts have been transferred to the income statement in respect of contracts matured during the period or in respect of changes in the fair value of non-hedging currency derivatives 2004 - nil.
The Group does not currently designate its foreign currency denominated debt as a hedging instrument for the purpose of hedging the translation of its foreign operations.
Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
Contracts with nominal values of 190 million have fixed interest payments at an average rate of 5.15 per cent for periods up until 2007.
In addition, at the balance sheet date, the Group had entered into further interest rate swaps with a nominal value of 100 million with fixed interest payments at an average of 4.49 per cent for the period from 2007 to 2010.
The fair value of swaps entered into at 31 December 2005 is estimated at a liability of 1,668,000 2004 - liability of 1,739,000.
All of these interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof has been recognised directly in equity.
An amount of 678,000 2004 - 1,579,000 has been offset against hedged interest payments made in the period.

Retirement Benefit Obligation In 2005, the Group operated the Johnston Press Pension Plan JPPP, together with the schemes it inherited in the businesses acquired.
The JPPP is in two parts, a defined contribution scheme and a defined benefit scheme.
The latter is closed to new members.
The Group has offered the UK based employees in the acquired businesses the option of transferring to the JPPP and is in the process of establishing a Group wide defined contribution scheme in the Republic of Ireland.
The assets of the schemes are held seperately from those of the Group.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of a triennial valuation using the projected unit method.
The financial information provided below relates to the defined element of the JPPP.
The defined contribution scheme provides for employee contributions between 2-4% dependent on age, with higher contributions from the Group.
In addition, the Group bears the majority of the administration costs and also life cover.
There are also executive sections of the scheme with increased contribution rates from both the employee and employer.
The pension cost charged to the Income Statement was as follows: 2005 2004 000 000 Defined benefit schemes 4,161 4,942 Defined contribution schemes 4,867 3,182 9,028 8,124 Major assumptions: Valuation at Valuation at 2005 2004 Discount rate 4.7% 5.3% Expected return on scheme assets 6.5% 7.0% Expected rate of salary increases 3.5% 3.5% Future pension increases 2.5% 2.5% Amounts recognised in the Income Statement in respect of defined benefit schemes: Year ended Year ended 2005 2004 000 000 Current service cost 4,161 4,942 Interest cost 16,505 14,969 Expected return on scheme assets 17,026 13,997 3,640 5,914 Of the current service cost for the year, 3,287,000 2004 - 3,904,000 has been included in cost of sales and 874,000 2004 - 1,038,000 has been included in operating expenses.
