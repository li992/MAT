This embedded derivative component represents the fair value of the option the Group had to cash settle any conversion option exercised by the bond holders.
The embedded derivative is only recognised upon adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 as at 1 January 2005.
The Group waived this cash settlement option on 17 January 2005, at which date the embedded derivative was transferred to reserves.
The interest charged for the year is calculated by applying an effective interest rate of 3.62% to the liability component for the period since the convertible US dollar bond was issued.
This is in addition to the coupon interest rate of 3.75% per annum.
The Directors estimate the fair value of the liability component of the convertible US dollar bonds at 31 December 2005 to be approximately 125 million 31 December 2004: 115 million.
This fair value has been determined by reference to the market price at 31 December 2005.
