Share-based payments The Group recognised a total expense of 4.5 million 2004: 3.8 million in respect of all share-based payments in the year.
Share-based payments include share options and conditional share awards.
Share options The Group issues share options to certain employees.
The grant price for share options is equal to the average quoted market price of the Company shares on the date of grant.
The vesting period is typically three years.
If share options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Share options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest and are subject to EPS performance conditions.
Further details are provided in the Remuneration Report.

The fair value per option granted weighted average in the year was 0.28 2004: 0.27.
The fair value of share options was determined using a stochastic model using the assumptions given in the table below: 2005 2004 Weighted average share price 1.02 0.97 Weighted average exercise price 1.03 0.96 Expected volatility 25% 25% Risk free rate 4.7% 4.7% Expected dividend yield 1.4% 1.4% Expected volatility was determined by considering the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years with certain periods where the share price was particularly volatile for specific reasons, being disregarded as these were not considered to be indicative of expected future volatility.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised a total expense of 2.3 million 2004: 2.2 million in respect of share options in the year.
Conditional share awards The Group issues conditional share awards to certain employees.
The extent to which awards vest is determined partly by reference to the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to a group of similar businesses and partly by reference to the Companys EPS growth relative to RPI.
The fair value of conditional share awards was determined using a stochastic model using the assumptions given in the table above.
The Group recognised a total expense of 2.2 million 2004: 1.6 million in respect of conditional share awards in the year.
