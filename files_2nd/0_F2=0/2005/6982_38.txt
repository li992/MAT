Financial instruments Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge certain transaction exposures to foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Credit risk The Group sets credit limits for customers based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references.
Credit limits are reviewed by credit controllers on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history.
The credit risk on derivative financial instruments is very limited as the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by independent international credit rating companies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
Interest rate risk Hedging The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that at least 50% of its exposure to changes in interest rates on fixed term borrowings is hedged.
At 31 December 2005, the Group had entered into two interest rate cap and collar transactions.
The cap on both financial instruments is US dollar LIBOR rate of 4.75% and the collars are 4.19% and 3.96% respectively.
Both instruments mature over the next five years consistent with the maturity of the related $250 million loan.
At 31 December 2005 the Group had interest rate hedges with a notional contract amount of $187,500,000 2004: $nil.
The Group classifies interest rate hedges as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value at 31 December 2005 was 864,000 2004: nil comprising a financial asset of 864,000.
This amount was recognised as a non-trade receivable in other current assets.
Liability bears interest at a fixed rate.
Foreign currency risk The Group incurs foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The currency primarily giving rise to this risk is the US dollar.
The Group hedges at least 80% of the anticipated US dollar cash flows for net anticipated receivables payables in the first three months forward, at least 50% in months four to six forward and at least 25% in months seven to twelve forward.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
All of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year later than the balance sheet date with the exception of one forward contact for US$375,000 which has a term which expires on 31 January 2007.
When financing material asset purchases or acquisitions the Groups policy is to create a natural hedge, as far as possible, in respect of any borrowings used for such purposes.
In respect of the American Cystoscope Makers Inc ACMI acquisition, the Group applied this policy by raising the loan facility in US dollars, being the principal currency of the assets acquired and the trade of ACMI.
The Group designates its forward foreign exchange contracts of the variability of cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value of these forward exchange contracts used as hedges of firm commitments and forecasted transactions at 31 December 2005 represented a liability of 147,000 that is recognised in non-trade payables.
The exchange rate for the transaction will be dependent upon the prevailing spot rate three working days prior to the settlement date.
If the spot rate is greater than 1.7880, then the exchange rate used for conversion to sterling will be 1.7880.
If the spot rate is between 1.6750 and 1.7880, then the exchange rate used will be the spot rate, and if the spot rate is less than 1.6750, then the exchange rate used will be 1.7385.
The fair value of this hedging contract on a mark to market basis was 23,000.
This has been recognised as a financial liability and is contained within non-trade payables.
