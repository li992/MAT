4 Tax on capital gains 4.1 For the purposes of tax on capital gains, the price of an ordinary share in the company on 31 March 1982 was 130.50p.
When adjusted for the 1 for 5 scrip issue in 1986, the 5 for 2 share split in 1993, the 1 for 1 bonus issue in 1996 and the share capital consolidation in 1998, this gives a figure of 22.54p.
4.2 Shareholders for whom the price of ordinary shares at 31 March 1982 is relevant should note that their allowable expenditure in relation to future disposals of ordinary shares may also be affected by other factors, such as indexation and or the disposal of fractional entitlements pursuant to the share capital consolidation of the company in April 1998.
5 Tax on dividends 5.1 A UK resident individual shareholder who receives a dividend is entitled to a tax credit in respect of the dividend.
5.2 The tax credit is 1 9th of the dividend corresponding to 10% of the dividend and the associated tax credit.
5.3 A UK resident individual shareholder is therefore treated as having paid tax at 10% on the aggregate of the dividend and the associated tax credit: as starting, lower and basic rate taxpayers are liable to tax on the dividend and associated tax credit at 10%, they will have no further liability to tax in respect of the dividend.
UK resident individuals cannot claim a refund of the 10% tax credit.
5.4 The tax liability on dividends for UK resident higher rate taxpayers is 32.5% on the aggregate of the dividend and the associated tax credit, so that their liability for additional tax is equal to 22.5% on the aggregate of the dividend and the associated tax credit.
5.5 Arrangements can be made for a shareholders dividends to be paid directly into a nominated bank account.
