Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 123 8 Longer term investment return continued c The longer term investment return is calculated separately for each principal general insurance and health business unit.
In respect of equities and properties, the return is calculated by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, by the longer term rate of investment return.
The longer term rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return.
The allocated longer term return for other investments is the actual income receivable for the year.
