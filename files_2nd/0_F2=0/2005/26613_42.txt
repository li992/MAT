Accordingly, the amount of loans to funds will vary from one period to the next as a consequence of the net effect of the level of sales in the period less the quantum of the external re-financing initiative in the period.
This external re-financing is typically in the form of total return swaps.
On these swaps the Group often enters into a committed purchase agreement and in some instances gives a first risk of loss guarantee to the external provider.
The probability of the Group incurring a loss as a result of giving these guarantees is remote as discussed in the Credit risk section of the Financial Review.
b Included within prepayments falling due within one year and after more than one year are unamortised sales commissions of $92 million and $240 million respectively 2004: $72 million and $200 million respectively.
c Certain Group companies in Brokerage are involved as principal in the purchase and simultaneous commitment to sell securities between third parties.
The gross amount of the settlement payables and receivables in respect of such outstanding transactions at 31 March 2005 was $366 million 2004: $1,358 million.
Substantially all of these transactions have now settled.
In addition, certain Group companies in Brokerage are involved in collateralised stock borrowing and lending transactions acting as an intermediary between counterparties.
The gross amount of payables and receivables in respect of such outstanding transactions at 31 March 2005 was $6,695 million 2004: $2,201 million.
Segregated balances As required by the United Kingdom Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and by the US Commodity Exchange Act, the Group maintains certain balances on behalf of clients with banks, exchanges, clearing houses and brokers in segregated accounts totalling, at 31 March 2005, $8,173 million 2004: $7,081 million.
These amounts and the related liabilities to clients, whose recourse is limited to the segregated accounts, are not included in the Group balance sheet.
The reason for their exclusion from the Group balance sheet is that the Group does not have a liability to its clients in the event that a third party depository institution, where the segregated funds are held, does not return all the segregated funds.
The corresponding asset, which is not co-mingled with the Groups funds and over which the Groups control is severely restricted, is therefore not recognised on the Group balance sheet.
