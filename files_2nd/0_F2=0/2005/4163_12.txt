The core element of the Group's borrowing requirement is provided by long term fixed interest loan notes.
The Group has limited its use of financial instruments to derivatives designed to protect the Group from fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.
The remaining borrowing requirement is funded principally through a revolving credit facility with variable interest rates.
This policy has remained in force during the year ended 31st October 2005.
All debtors and creditors due within one year have, as permitted, been excluded from the disclosure requirements of FRS13.
Financial liabilities The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the Group was: Financial Floating rate Fixed rate liabilities financial financial carrying no liabilities liabilities interest Total Sterling m m m m At 31st October 2005 Bank borrowings, loan notes and long term creditors 96.9 120.1 93.7 310.7 Preference shares - 38.0 - 38.0 96.9 158.1 93.7 348.7 At 31st October 2004 Bank borrowings, loan notes and long term creditors 69.2 120.1 225.3 414.6 Preference shares - 38.0 - 38.0 69.2 158.1 225.3 452.6 Fixed rate financial liabilities are stated after cross currency swaps which had the effect of reclassifying $166m 2004 $166m US dollar borrowings into 110.1m 2004 110.1m sterling borrowings.
The fixed rate financial liabilities are at a weighted average of 7.43% 2004 7.43% fixed for an average of 3.3 years 2004 4.8 years.
The preference shares have been redeemed on 2nd November 2005.
The floating rate financial liabilities are subject to interest rates referenced to LIBOR.
These rates are for a period between one and twelve months.
For financial liabilities which have no interest payable, consisting of land creditors, the weighted average period to maturity is 20 months 2004 33 months.
The fair value of these liabilities at 31st October 2005 is 84.0m 2004 192.2m.
The discount rate applied is equivalent to the Group's current incremental borrowing rate.
There are no other material differences between book value and fair value of the Group's financial assets and liabilities.
The Company has a number of guarantees in place as described in Note 22 which are contingent liabilities and therefore have no book value and it is not practical to estimate their fair value.
The maturity of the financial liabilities is: 2005 2004 m m Repayable within one year 51.0 3.2 Repayable between one and two years 95.0 97.4 Repayable between two and five years 128.1 243.7 Repayable after five years 74.6 108.3 348.7 452.6 Financial assets Financial assets of the Group at 31st October 2005 consisted of sterling cash deposits of 57.0m 2004 10.9m placed overnight, with solicitors and on current account.

The repayment terms of the facilities are set out in Note 12.
In addition there were undrawn guarantee and bonding facilities of 39.6m 2004 55.8m.
Crest Nicholson Annual Report 2005 43 Notes to the accounts 21 Pensions Defined contribution scheme The Group operates a defined contribution scheme for new employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund.
The service cost of this scheme for the year was 0.6m 2004 0.4m.
At the balance sheet date there were no outstanding or prepaid contributions 2004 Nil.
Defined benefit scheme The Group operates contributory defined benefit pension schemes which are closed to new entrants.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group, being invested in managed funds.
Contributions to the schemes are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees' working lives with the Group.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of a market-based triennial valuation using the attained age method.
The most recent funding valuation of the main scheme was carried out as at 1st February 2004 and the most significant assumptions adopted were: Investment returns before retirement 6.75% per annum Investment returns after retirement 6.00% per annum Salary increases 4.00% per annum Pensions increases in respect of benefits earned before 6th April 1997 3.00% per annum Pensions increases in respect of benefits earned after 5th April 1997 2.40% per annum After taking account of the above assumptions, the actuarial value of the scheme's assets represented 80% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The market value of these assets was estimated at 49m excluding pensions in payment secured by purchasing annuities from an insurance company.
The assumptions used for SSAP24 purposes were the same as those shown above with the following exceptions: Investment returns after retirement 6.75% per annum Salary increases 3.75% per annum The combined pension charge for the year was 4.1m 2004 2.8m.
The actual contribution paid by the Company was 3.9m 2004 2.6m which resulted in a prepayment at the year end of 2.1m 2004 2.3m.
The method used for spreading the deficit was the Level Percentage Method.
Additional disclosure required by FRS17 In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS17, a full actuarial valuation update of the defined benefit schemes was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 31st October 2005 using the projected unit method.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2005 2004 2003 2002 Discount rate 5.0% 5.4% 5.5% 5.6% Inflation 2.9% 2.9% 2.7% 2.3% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.9% 3.9% 3.7% 3.3% Rate of increase in pensions in payment: Earned before 6th April 1997 3.0% 3.0% 3.0% 3.0% Earned after 5th April 1997 2.6% 2.6% 2.4% 2.0% As the scheme is closed to new members, under the projected unit method, the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

In addition the total pension prepayment of 2.1m would have been deducted from shareholders' funds.
Some of the above items expressed as a percentage of the assets or liabilities are as follows: 2005 2004 2003 2002 Actual return less expected return as a percentage of scheme assets 6% 2% 9% 17% Experience gains and losses as a percentage of scheme liabilities - 6% 2% 2% Actuarial loss gain as a percentage of scheme liabilities 4% 3% 9% 12% If the above amounts had been recognised in the financial statements, the Group's net assets and profit and loss reserve at 31st October 2005 would be as follows: 2005 2004 m m Net assets excluding pension deficit 367.4 328.4 Adjustment for pension prepayment 2.1 2.3 Pension deficit 24.7 21.3 Net assets including pension deficit 340.6 304.8 Profit and loss reserve excluding pension deficit 260.5 222.3 Adjustment for pension prepayment 2.1 2.3 Pension deficit 24.7 21.3 Profit and loss reserve including pension deficit 233.7 198.7 22 Contingent Liabilities There are performance bonds and other engagements, including those in respect of joint venture partners, undertaken in the ordinary course of business from which it is anticipated that no material liabilities will arise.
