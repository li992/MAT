Principal accounting policies Basis of preparation the principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 december 2005 and 2004 the consolidated financial statements are set out below.
the text below describes how, in preparing the financial statements, the directors have applied International Financial Reporting standards as adopted in the eu IFRs under the first-time adoption provisions set out in IFRs 1 and the assumptions they have made about the standards and interpretations effective and the policies adopted in the 2005 financial statements.
these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRs and IFRIc interpretations and with those parts of the companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRs.
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities as described later in these accounting policies.
Basis of accounting the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRs requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the Balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best estimate of the amount, event or actions, these results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
the areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in note 4.
Accounting policies adopted in preparing these consolidated financial statements have been selected in accordance with IFRs.
IFRs 1, First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting standards sets out the procedures that the Group must follow when it adopts IFRs for the first time as the basis for preparing its consolidated financial statements.
the Group is required to establish accounting policies in line with the version of IFRs valid as at 31 december 2005 and, in general, apply these policies retrospectively to prepare the IFRs opening balance sheet assuming a transition date of 1 January 2004.
In the first year of adoption under IFRs, there are a number of exemptions from the retrospective application.
the exemptions adopted by the Group include: a.
Business combinations that occurred before the opening iFRS balance sheet date iFRS 3, Business combinations the Group has not applied IFRs 3 retrospectively to business combinations that took place before the date of transition.
As a result in the opening balance sheet for IFRs, the carrying amount of goodwill under uK GAAp, arising from past business combinations of us$402.9 million is deemed to be the cost of the asset on transition.
the carrying amount of goodwill at 1 January 2004 under uK GAAp consisted of the original value of goodwill of us$403.5 million arising on the acquisition of Inmarsat Ventures limited at 17 december 2003 less amoritsation of us$0.6 million for the financial year 2003. b. employee benefitsactuarial gains and losses iaS 19, employee benefits All cumulative actuarial gains and losses in relation to employee benefit schemes have been recognised by the Group at the date of transition.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense in accordance with the amendment to IAs 19 issued on 16 december 2004.
INMARSAT PLC AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2005 44 UNiqUely placed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements c. cumulative translation differences the Group has applied the exemption which allows the cumulative translation difference to be set to zero at the date of transition for all foreign subsidiary undertakings.
As at 31 december 2004, the Group had not adopted the following standards or interpretations which under the provisions of IFRs1 do not need to be applied until financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2005. the Group adopted these standards as at 1 January 2005. a.
Financial instruments iaS 39, Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement and iaS 32, Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation the impact on the Group of IAs 39 and IAs 32 is to recognise the Groups interest rate swap and forward exchange contracts on the balance sheet at fair value.
b. Non-current assets held for sale iFRS 5, Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations under IFRs 5 the Group would have had to reclassify the Groups head office from land and buildings to non-current assets held for sale effective from July 2004 and the date the company committed to sell the building and cease depreciating the asset from then until the effective date of the sale in november 2004. this would have resulted in a us$1.2 million decrease to depreciation and an equivalent decrease to the gain on disposal of property included in the consolidated Income statement for the 2004 financial year.
c. international Financial Reporting interpretations committee Standards iFRics 2-9 the Group has considered the potential impact of IFRIcs 2-9, and has decided not to adopt these standards.
Basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its domestic and overseas subsidiary undertakings.
All intercompany transactions and balances with subsidiary undertakings have been eliminated on consolidation.
subsidiary undertakings include all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting rights.
the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
the results of subsidiary undertakings established or acquired during the period are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of establishment or acquisition of control.
the results of subsidiary undertakings disposed of during the period are included until the date of disposal.
on the acquisition of a company or business, fair values reflecting conditions at the date of acquisition are attributed to the identifiable separable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Where the fair value of the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the identifiable separable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill.
Fees and similar incremental costs incurred directly in making an acquisition are included in the cost of the acquisition and capitalised.
Internal costs, and other expenses that cannot be directly attributed to the acquisition, are charged to the Income statement.
comparatives the Group previously disclosed foreign exchange gains and losses within employee benefit costs, network and satellite operations costs and other operating costs.
Management believes that their inclusion as part of other operating costs, is a fairer representation of the Groups activities and, as a result, us$5.7 million of foreign exchange losses were reclassified to other operating costs in the 2004 financial year.
the Group has reclassified the 2004 current and deferred income tax balances to reflect the treatment of pension and post-retirement benefits under IAs 19 employee Benefits.
the effect of this reclassification is to increase the current income tax liability as at 31 december 2004 by us$3.3 million, with a corresponding decrease in the deferred tax liability consisting of a us$2.2 million adjustment to opening balances and us$1.1 million reclassification within the 2004 financial year tax charge between deferred and current tax.
the impact on net assets is us$nil.
INMARSAT PLC AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2005 45 UNiqUely placed Restatements the Group has restated the 2004 income tax expense to account for a us$4.2 million asset recorded incorrectly on interest deductions in the prior year.
the effect of this restatement is to increase the total income tax expense by us$4.2 million, with a corresponding increase to the current tax liability of us$4.2 million for the 2004 financial year.
the impact reduces net assets in the 2004 financial year from us$2.7 million to a net liability balance of us$1.5 million.
Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency the functional currency of the company and most of the Groups subsidiaries and the presentation currency of the Group is the us dollar, as the majority of operational transactions are denominated in us dollars.
the exchange rate between us dollars and pounds sterling as at 31 december 2005 was us$1.72 1.00 2004: us$1.92 1.00. b Transactions and balances transactions not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiary undertakings of the Group during the year have been translated using the spot rates of exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions.
differences on exchange arising on both settlement of the transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currency at year end rates are recognised in the Income statement.
c Group companies the Groups interests in the underlying net assets of non us dollar subsidiary undertakings are translated into us dollars as follows: i assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end rate: ii transactions in the Income statement are translated at average exchange rates: and iii all resulting differences on exchange are recognised in shareholders equity.
Financial instruments and hedging activities Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.
Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value.
subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument.
non-derivative financial assets are classified as either short-term deposits or cash and cash equivalents.
they are stated at amortised cost using the effective-interest method, subject to reduction for allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
For interest-bearing assets, their carrying value includes accrued interest receivable.
cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and bank time deposits, together with other short-term highly liquid investments.
In the cash Flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts, which are included as current borrowings in liabilities on the balance sheet.
non-derivative financial liabilities are all classified as other liabilities and stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
For borrowings, their carrying value includes accrued interest payable, as well as unamortised issue costs.
the Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational and financing activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAs 39 are accounted for as trading instruments.
derivatives are initially recognised and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value.
the gain or loss on remeasurement is taken to the Income statement except where the derivative is a designated cash flow hedging instrument.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
the Group is also required to document the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument and demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
this effectiveness testing is reperformed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
INMARSAT PLC AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2005 46 UNiqUely placed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Gains or losses on cash flow hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity.
Where the forecast transaction results in a financial asset or liability, gains or losses previously recognised in equity are reclassified to the Income statement in the same period as the asset or liability impacts income.
If the forecasted transaction or commitment results in future income or expenditure, gains or losses deferred in equity are transferred to the Income statement in the same period as the underlying income or expenditure.
the ineffective portions of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument are recognised immediately in the Income statement.
Where a hedge no longer meets the effectiveness criteria, any gains or losses deferred in equity are only transferred to the Income statement when the committed or forecasted transaction is recognised in the Income statement.
However, where the Group has applied cash flow hedge accounting for a forecasted or committed transaction that is no longer expected to occur, then the cumulative gain or loss that has been recorded in equity is transferred to the Income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Income statement.
Revenue recognition Mobile satellite communications services revenue results from utilisation charges that are recognised as revenue over the period in which the services are provided.
deferred income attributable to mobile satellite communications services revenues represents the unearned balances remaining from amounts received from customers pursuant to prepaid lease contracts.
these amounts are recorded as revenue on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms, which are typically for periods of one month to twelve months.
the Groups revenues are stated net of volume discounts which increase over the course of the financial year as specific volume thresholds are met by distribution partners resulting in lower prices.
Revenues in respect of long-term service contracts of the Groups subsidiary Invsat limited are calculated in a manner appropriate to the stage of completion of the contracts.
Revenue also includes income from services contracts, rental income, conference facilities and income from the sale of Regional BGAn R-BGAn terminals.
the costs of acquiring these terminals are included in other operating costs when the sale is recognised.
employee benefits Wages, salaries, social security contributions, accumulating annual leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are performed by the employees of the Group.
termination benefits are payable whenever an employees employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.
the Group recognises termination benefits when it has demonstrably committed to either terminate the employment of current employees or to provide termination benefits, as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
the Group recognises liabilities relating to defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement healthcare benefits in respect of employees in the uK and overseas.
the Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement healthcare benefits are calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
the calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses as at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRs, are recognised in the opening IFRs balance sheet.
All actuarial gains and losses that arise subsequent to 1 January 2004 in calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are immediately recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
the Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes in its principal locations.
pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are charged to the Income statement as incurred when the related employee service is rendered.
INMARSAT PLC AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2005 47 UNiqUely placed deferred income tax deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary deductible differences or tax loss carry forwards can be utilised.
deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Research and development Research expenditure is expensed when incurred.
development expenditure is expensed when incurred unless it meets criteria for capitalisation.
development costs are only capitalised once a business case has been demonstrated as to the technical feasibility and commercial viability.
capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life.
property, plant and equipment Space segment assets space segment assets comprise satellite construction, launch and other associated costs.
expenditure charged to space segment projects includes invoiced progress payments, amounts accrued appropriate to the stage of completion of contract milestone payments, external consultancy costs and direct internal costs.
Internal costs, comprising primarily staff costs, are only capitalised when they are directly attributable to the construction of an asset.
progress payments are determined on milestones achieved to date together with agreed cost escalation indices.
deferred satellite payments represent the net present value of future payments dependent on the future performance of each satellite and are recognised in space segment assets when the satellite becomes operational.
the associated liability is stated at its net present value and included within liabilities.
these space segment assets are depreciated over the life of the satellites from the date they become operational and are placed into service.
assets in course of construction Assets in course of construction relate to the next generation Inmarsat-4 satellites and BGAn services.
these assets will be transferred to space segment assets and depreciated over the life of the satellites once they become operational and placed into service.
no depreciation has been charged on these assets.
Other fixed assets other fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
depreciation depreciation is calculated to write off the historical cost less residual values, if any, of fixed assets, except land, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
the Group selects its depreciation rates carefully and reviews them annually to take account of any changes in circumstances.
When setting useful economic lives, the principal factors the Group takes into account are the expected rate of technological developments, expected market requirements for the equipment and the intensity at which the assets are expected to be used.
the lives assigned to significant tangible fixed assets are: space segment 515 years Fixtures and fittings, and other building-related equipment 10 years Buildings 50 years other fixed assets 35 years As a result of managements regular reassessment of useful economic lives, the useful lives of the Groups Inmarsat-3 satellites and space segment assets were prospectively changed from 1 october 2004. the changes were made to better reflect the economic life of Inmarsat-3 satellites resulting from improvements in satellite technology as supported by engineering analysis.
As a result depreciation periods were extended for the Inmarsat-3 satellites from 10 years to 13 years.
INMARSAT PLC AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2005 48 UNiqUely placed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements the financial impact of the change in the useful economic lives of the Inmarsat-3 satellites is a decrease in depreciation expense in 2005 and 2006 of approximately us$44.5 million and us$33.3 million, respectively.
the carrying amounts of assets in the Balance sheet is higher as a result of these revised estimates.
After 2006 there will be an increase to depreciation expense in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 of approximately us$7.5 million, us$34.4 million, us$31.7 million, us$13.2 million and us$2.1 million, respectively.
the carrying values of these assets will be written down proportionately in the Balance sheet as a result.
effective 1 october 2005, the Group prospectively changed the useful economic lives of the Inmarsat-4 satellites from 13 years to 15 years to better reflect the design life of the spacecraft, the better-than-expected performance of the launch vehicles and the adoption of an optimal mission strategy which are expected to extend the orbital lives of these satellites.
the satellite and space segment assets depreciable lives primarily range from 10 to 15 years, with the exception of R-BGAn assets for which they are 5 years.
the first of the Inmarsat-4 satellites has now been placed into service and the Group is currently depreciating this asset over 15 years.
the financial impact of the change in the useful economic lives of the Inmarsat-4 satellite currently being depreciated is a decrease in depreciation expense in 2005 of approximately us$0.8 million and in 2006 through 2017 of approximately us$3.3 million each year respectively.
the carrying amounts of assets in the Balance sheet will be proportionately higher as a result of these revised estimates.
After 2018 there will be an increase to depreciation expense in 2018, 2019, 2020 of approximately us$11.2 million, us$21.7 million, and us$9.1 million, respectively.
Gains and losses on disposals of tangible and intangible assets Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing net proceeds with the carrying amount.
these are included in the Income statement.
Gains and losses on termination of subsidiary undertakings Gains and losses on termination of subsidiary undertakings are determined by comparing net proceeds with the carrying amount.
intangible assets Intangible assets comprise goodwill, patents, trademarks, software and terminal development costs.
the amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed each financial year.
a Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid on the acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units cGus for the purpose of impairment testing.
b patents and trademarks patents and trademarks are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which are 7 and 20 years respectively.
c Software development costs development costs directly relating to the development of new services are capitalised as intangible assets.
costs are capitalised once a business case has been demonstrated as to a technical feasibility and commercial viability.
such costs are amortised over the estimated sales life of the services.
d Terminal development costs the Group capitalises development costs associated with the development of user terminals.
For R-BGAn and BGAn services terminal development costs are amortised using straight line method over their estimated useful lives which is between 5 and 10 years.
impairment of non-financial assets Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
the impairment review comprises a comparison of the carrying amount of the fixed asset or goodwill with its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Fair value less costs to sell is calculated by reference to the amount at which the asset could be disposed of.
Value in use is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows obtainable as a result of the assets continued use, including those resulting from its ultimate disposal, at a market-based discount rate on a pre-tax basis.
INMARSAT PLC AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2005 49 UNiqUely placed An impairment loss is recognised in the Income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
the carrying amount will only be increased where an impairment loss recognised in a previous period for an asset other than goodwill either no longer exists or has decreased, up to the amount that it would have been had the original impairment not occurred.
Any impairment to goodwill recognised in a previous period will not be reversed.
For the purpose of conducting impairment reviews, cash generating units are identified as groups of assets, liabilities and associated goodwill that generate cashflows that are largely independent of other cashflow streams.
the assets and liabilities include those directly involved in generating the cashflows and an appropriate proportion of corporate assets.
For the purposes of impairment review space segment assets are treated as one cash generating unit.
Goodwill was tested for impairment at 1 January 2004, 31 december 2004 and 31 december 2005: no evidence of impairment was found.
leases leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases by the lessee.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Income statement in equal amounts over the term of the lease.
interest and finance costs Interest is recognised in the Income statement using the effective yield method on a time proportion basis.
transaction and arrangement costs of borrowings are capitalised as part of the carrying amount of the borrowings and amortised over the life of the debt.
Facility fees are expensed as incurred.
the accretion of the discount on the principal on the subordinated preference certificates and senior discount notes is accounted for as an interest expense.
inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
cost is determined by the average cost method.
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents, measured at fair value, includes cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings as current liabilities on the Balance sheet.
Short-term deposits Includes deposits held on call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturity between three and 12 months, with highly rated counter parties.
Restricted cash Restricted cash is primarily held in a charged account for capital expenditure in association with the Inmarsat-4 programme.
Following the refinancing of the senior credit Facilities during 2005, no cash is restricted.
provisions provisions, other than in respect of pension and post-retirement healthcare benefits, are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to transfer economic benefits arising from past events and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
provisions are not recognised unless the outflow of economic benefits to settle the obligation is more likely than not to occur.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised as proceeds received, net of transaction and arrangement costs incurred.
transaction and arrangement costs of borrowings and the difference between the proceeds and the redemption value are recognised in the Income statement over the life of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
INMARSAT PLC AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2005 50 UNiqUely placed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the Balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs for the construction of assets are not capitalised.
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation eBiTda eBItdA is defined as profit before income tax, plus net interest payable, depreciation, amortisation, impairments of assets and when applicable gains losses from disposal of fixed assets and termination of subsidiary undertakings.
Financial risk management Financial risk factors the Groups operations and significant debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices and foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates.
the Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using an interest rate swap and forward exchange contracts to limit exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risks.
the Board of directors has delegated to a sub-committee, the treasury Review committee, the responsibility for setting the risk management policies applied by the Group.
the policies are implemented by the central treasury department that receives regular reports from all the operating companies to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
the treasury department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines for managing foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk by using financial instruments.
see note 30. a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk the functional currency of Inmarsat plc is us dollars and the Group generates most of its revenue in us dollars.
the vast majority of capital expenditure is denominated in us dollars.
Approximately 60% of the Groups operating costs are denominated in sterling.
this exposure therefore needs to be carefully managed to avoid variability in future cash flows and earnings caused by volatile foreign exchange rates.
As a guide the Groups sterling operating cost base, excluding rental payments, has been relatively constant at approximately 5 million per month.
the foreign currency hedging policy of the Group is to economically hedge a minimum of 50% of anticipated sterling denominated operating expenses for the next 12 months and up to a maximum of 100% for the next three years on a rolling basis.
As at 31 december 2005, it is estimated that a movement of the us dollar sterling exchange rate of 1% would have impacted the 2005 profit before tax by approximately us$1.1 million.
ii price risk the Group is not exposed to significant equity securities price risk or commodity price risk.
b interest rate risk the Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities.
the policy of the Group, because of the high level of debt, is to ensure certainty of the interest charge by fixing interest rates on a high proportion of debt.
Both the senior notes and the senior discount notes are at fixed rates.
the risk management objective is to eliminate the variability in the interest payments for us$150 million of the outstanding borrowings under the senior credit Facility, the sole source of which is due to changes in the three-month us dollar lIBoR rate.
changes in the cash flows of the interest rate swap are expected to exactly offset the changes in the cash flows of the borrowings.
As a result 88% of total debt is fixed.
the amount of debt that is floating is partially offset by surplus cash.
As at 31 december 2005, on the basis of past net cash balances, it is estimated that a 1% movement in interest rates would have impacted 2005 profit before tax by approximately us$0.6 million.
INMARSAT PLC AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2005 51 UNiqUely placed c credit risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, shortterm deposits and trade receivables.
All cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits are deposited with high credit quality financial institutions.
the directors consider credit risk is small on trade receivables as these balances are primarily with telecoms companies who are also distribution partners.
For 2005, four distribution partners comprised approximately 82.3% of Group revenues.
these same four customers comprised 84.1% of the trade debtor balance as at 31 december 2005. d liquidity risk the Group maintains long-term revolving credit committed facilities of us$300 million that are designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds for operations.
none of these facilities had been drawn as at 31 december 2005.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the Balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
the more significant estimates are discussed below: a estimated impairment of goodwill the Group annually undertakes tests to determine whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2. the carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets are given in note 15.
For the purpose of testing for impairment, goodwill is specifically allocated to cGus and tested by comparing the carrying amount of the cGu with its recoverable amount.
the recoverable amounts of cGus have been determined based on fair value less costs to sell.
two cGus have been identifiedthese are Mobile satellite services and other.
It has been determined that goodwill that arose on the acquisition of Inmarsat Ventures limited represented goodwill of the Mobile satellite services cGu only.
therefore, goodwill has been tested for impairment on the Mobile satellite services cGu only.
In June 2005, the company listed as a public company on the london stock exchange raising approximately us$670 million of gross primary proceeds on Admission with the issue of 150 million shares at a nominal value of 0.0005 and a price of 2.45 per share.
In light of the significance of the Mobile satellites services cGu to the Group as a whole, and that the Ipo occurred during 2005 the directors considered that the Ipo provided an appropriate measure of the fair value of the Mobile satellite services cGu, and have therefore used the companys market capitalisation at that time as the basis for the goodwill impairment test.
using this measure, no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill was recognised and since the Ipo, the company has successfully launched its second Inmarsat-4 satellite and has seen a significant increase in the market value of its shares on the london stock exchange.
In the opinion of the directors, there have been no changes in the business strategy that would result in the carrying value of goodwill exceeding its recoverable amount.
b pension assumptions the Group has applied a rate of return on assets of 7.31% p. a. which represents the expected return on asset holdings going forward.

Facilities comprised one us$400 million facility term loan A, two separate us$200 million facilities term loan B and term loan c, respectively, one us$100 million senior capital expenditure Facility and a multi-currency Working capital Facility of us$75 million.
the capital expenditure and multi-currency Working capital Facility were undrawn at 31 december 2004. the senior Facility required a mandatory-repayment of 50% of the net proceeds of the sale and leaseback of 99 city Road.
Accordingly us$62.5 million was repaid in november 2004. the amounts drawn at 31 december 2004 were as follows: us$368.7 million term loan A and us$184.4 million under both term loan B and c. on 24 May 2005 Inmarsat Investments limited signed a new us$550 million credit agreement.
the new senior credit Facility in combination with Ipo proceeds was used to repay the previous senior credit Facility.
b prior to the cancellation of the previous senior credit Facilities, term loan A was to mature on 17 december 2009, the sixth anniversary of the date of the closing of the acquisition of Inmarsat Ventures limited, being 17 december 2003, and was repayable in incremental instalments from 2.5% payable 18 months after the date of the closing of the acquisition, to 17.5% on the sixth anniversary after the closing of the acquisition.
term loan A bore interest at lIBoR plus 2.5%, payable semi-annually.
the margin on term loan A was subject to a margin ratchet depending on the Group achieving certain ratios of total borrowings to eBItdA, to a minimum margin of 2.125% per annum.
c prior to the cancellation of the previous senior credit Facilities, term loan B was to be repaid in two equal instalments.
the first instalment on a date 180 days prior to the second instalment and the second instalment on the seventh anniversary of the date of the closing of the acquisition, being 17 december 2003. term loan B bore interest at lIBoR plus 3% and was payable semi-annually.

e the capital expenditure Facility was undrawn at 31 december 2004 and was cancelled on 24 May 2005. f the Working capital Facility was undrawn at 31 december 2004 and was cancelled on 22 June 2005 when Facilities A, B and c were repaid in full with proceeds from the new facility.
g the Bridge loan facility was entered into to cover excess funding requirements between the date of the acquisition and the issue of the senior notes being finalised.
the Bridge loan facility bore interest at 9.16% payable monthly.
In February 2004 proceeds of the us$375 million 7.625% senior notes were used to redeem the Bridge loan facility.
the senior notes were issued by Inmarsat Finance plc, a 100% owned subsidiary of Inmarsat Group limited.
the senior notes mature on 30 June 2012.
Interest is payable semi-annually in February and August.
In May 2004 a further issue of senior notes for us$102.5 million was completed bringing the total amount to us$477.5 million.

In december 2005 Inmarsat Investments limited purchased $10 million of the senior notes for $10.5 million.
Inmarsat Investments limited paid a premium of us$0.3 million and prepaid interest of us$0.2 million which will later be received back.
taking into account the Groups short-term cash surplus, the total payment of us$10.5 million results in an overall economic benefit to the Group when the premium paid is compared to future net interest charges discounted back to todays values.

prior to repayment the subordinated preference certificates were revalued at 31 december 2004 to us$348.5 million creating a non-cash exchange loss of us$43.3 million.
In addition, a foreign exchange gain of us$15.3 million was recognised in 2004 from partial redemption of the subordinated preference certificates.
A foreign exchange gain of us$39.3 million was recognised from the full redemption of outstanding subordinated preference certificates on 22 June 2005.

the notes Mature on 15 november 2012. the net proceeds of us$291 million were used to redeem subordinated preference certificates in 2004 discussed in h above.
k on 24 May 2005, Inmarsat Investments limited signed a new us$550 million senior credit Facility led by Barclays capital, InG Bank n. V. and the Royal Bank of scotland plc.
the facility is for general corporate purposes including the repayment of the previous senior credit Facility in note a above and was arranged in connection with the Ipo in June 2005. the us$550 million five-year senior credit Facility consists of a us$250 million amortising term loan and a us$300 million revolving credit facility.

the us$300 million revolving credit facility is undrawn at 31 december 2005. the new senior credit Facility, in combination with existing surplus cash and the proceeds of the Ipo, was used to repay the previous senior credit Facility of us$728.0 million, the outstanding balance of the euro-denominated subordinated preference certificates 272.7 million and 35% repayment of the senior notes in note g. As at 31 december 2005 us$250 million was drawn down at 3 month usd lIBoR plus a margin of 0.9%.
However, this is offset via the interest rate swap of us$150m principal where 3 month usd lIBoR is received but a fixed rate of 3.21% is paid.
the year-end borrowing rate of 4.62% represents a blended rate from the floating draw-down rate and the related interest rate swap.

Employee share options In november 2004, the company adopted the staff Value participation plan 2004 plan.
219,020 A ordinary shares were granted under the 2004 plan to any director or employee of the Group.
options under the 2004 plan vest as follows: i 25% granted and held by optionholders have vested and became exercisable in July 2005: ii 37.5% of the options granted under the 2004 plan and held by optionholders have vested and became exercisable in March 2006: and iii all remaining options granted under the 2004 plan and held by optionholders will vest and become exercisable on 1 december 2006.
Whenever options are exercised under the 2004 plan the holder must pay a charge of 1 for each tranche of options exercised.
the options expire 10 years from the date of grant.
A second grant of options over 7,140 A ordinary shares was made under the 2004 plan to employees in January 2005. this was made on equivalent terms to the initial grant in november 2004.
A third grant of options over 1,175,240 ordinary shares of 0.005 each was approved in May 2005 under the 2004 plan and granted to employees in June 2005. this was made on equivalent terms to the initial grant in november 2004.

In line with IFRs2, share-Based payment, the company recognised us$6.5 million and us$0.1 million respectively in share compensation costs for the 2005 and 2004 financial years.
total share-based compensation costs will be recognised over the vesting period of the options ranging from one to four years.
prior to the company being publicly quoted, the exercise price of the options under the A ordinary shares issued in the 2004 plan of the company is fide minimis in nature, the fair value of each option is equivalent to the fair value of the underlying share at the date of the grant.
this fair value of us$12.50 per share before any adjustment for the share split in June 2005 was estimated with the assistance of independent advisers, who calculated a range of potential values using analysis of comparable quoted shares, discounted cash flows and comparable transactions.
the fair value within this range was then selected by the directors using the independent analysis which had been prepared.
For the options granted under the 2004 plan in June 2005 before share split, the fair value was estimated by the directors to be us$30.00 per share.
the us$30.00 was calculated using a similar methodology to the independent advisers as the directors of the company continued to believe that the discounted trading multiple approach was the most appropriate.
INMARSAT PLC AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2005 66 UNiqUely placed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements the company also operates a Bonus share plan Bsp and awards were granted on 31 May 2005 but were only awarded after the announcement of the 2005 financial results in March 2006. there was an additional grant under this scheme in september 2005 with the same conditions as the original grant.
these awards were made in the form of a conditional allocation of shares.
the performance conditions attached to the annual bonus plan are non-market based performance conditions.
details of the operation of the Bsp can be found in the directors Remuneration Report.
the awards will vest in three equal tranches following the announcement of the final results for each of the financial years 2006, 2007 and 2008, subject to continued employment.
the rules of the Bsp provide that the Remuneration committee has the discretion to satisfy the awards using cash instead of shares.
It is the intention, however, of the company to satisfy the awards using shares only.
As the Bsp provides free share awards with no market based performance condition attached, and which carry an entitlement to dividends paid in cash or shares during the vesting period, the fair value of the awards is the value of the grant.
this is due to the fact that regardless of the market price at the time the award or shares is made, the total value of shares to be awarded will not change.
A total number of 215,542 shares have been awarded at a share price of 3.83 in respect of the two grants made under the Bsp.
In addition to the Bsp the company also operates a performance share plan psp where awards were granted on 31 May 2005 in the form of a conditional allocation of shares.
the number of shares subject to the award was determined by reference to the price at which the shares were offered for sale on Admission of 2.45 per share.
participants are entitled to receive the value of any dividends that are paid during the vesting period in the form of cash or additional shares.
there was an additional grant in september 2005 with the same requirements except the reference price in determining the number of shares was 3.24 market value of shares on the date of grant.
the psp shares will not normally be transferred to participants until the third anniversary of the award date.
the transfer of shares is dependent upon the performance condition being satisfied over the three consecutive financial years starting in the financial year the award date falls which is 2005. the rules of the psp provide that the Remuneration committee has the discretion to satisfy the awards using cash instead of shares.
options under the psp were valued using the deloitte option pricing tool.
the performance condition is based on the Groups total shareholder Return tsR relative to constituents of the Ftse 350 index excluding investment trusts and a non-market based condition, based on eBItdA measured over a three-year period.
the vesting schedule for psp awards is structured so that the shape of the tsR vesting schedule is determined by eBItdA performance.
the market based performance condition has been incorporated into the valuation.
the fair value of the allocation and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: performance share plan Grant date 31 May 2005 29 september 2005 Grant price 1.96 3.24 exercise price nil nil Bad leaver rate 0% 0% Vesting period 3 years 3 years expected correlation between any pair of shares in psp comparator group 12% 10% Volatility 36% 34% Fair value per share 1.34 2.20 Both the Bsp and psp share awards expire 10 years after date of grant.
the weighted average of the remaining contractual life for Bsp and psp share awards is 9.7 years and 9.4 years, respectively.
the company also operates a uK sharesave scheme for which the first invitation was made in June 2005. the sharesave scheme is an Inland Revenue approved scheme open to all uK pAYe-paying permanent employees.
the maximum that can be saved each month by an employee is 250. savings over the period plus interest may be used to acquire shares at the end of the savings contract.
the options have been granted at a 20% discount to market value of the shares on the invitation date 23 June 2005. the scheme operates with a three year savings contract.
options are exercisable for a period of up to six months following the end of the three year savings contract.
no dividends are accumulated on options during the vesting period.
the company also operates an International sharesave scheme which mirrors the operation of the uK sharesave scheme as closely as possible.
However, instead of receiving a share option, participants receive the spread between the share price at the end of the vesting period and the exercise price, delivered at the companys discretion in cash or shares.
It is the companys intention to satisfy the awards using shares only.
INMARSAT PLC AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2005 67 UNiqUely placed options under the uK and International sharesave schemes expire after a maximum of 3.5 years following the initial savings payment having been made.
the weighted average of the remaining contractual life for both the uK and International sharesave schemes is 3.1 years.
options under both the uK and International sharesave schemes have been valued using the Black scholes model with the following assumptions: sharesave sharesave scheme scheme uK Int Grant date 21 July 2005 19 october 2005 Market price date of Grant 3.14 2.80 exercise price 2.24 2.24 Bad leaver rate 5%pa 5%pa Vesting period 3 years 3 years Volatility 35% 34% dividend yield assumption 3.6% 2.8% Risk free interest rate 4.25% 4.25% Fair value per option 1.10 0.90 the historic volatility is based on the constituents of the Ftse 350 telecoms service Index, which was measured over three years to each of the grant dates.

Pension arrangements and post-retirement healthcare benefits the Group provides both pension fund arrangements and post-retirement medical benefits for its employees.
the Group operates pension schemes in each of its principal locations.
the uK scheme has two plans: a defined benefit scheme, which is closed to new employees, and a defined contribution plan.
the defined benefit scheme is funded and its assets are held in a separate fund administered by a corporate trustee.
us$2.0 million and us$4.5 million was charged in the Income statement in the 2005 and 2004 financial year in respect of the defined benefit scheme.
the defined benefit plan was valued using the projected unit credit method with the formal valuation undertaken by professionally qualified and independent actuaries as at 31 december 2002. the actuarial valuation of the assets of the scheme at that date, net of liabilities, was us$9.3 million.
the results of the valuation have been updated for any material transactions and material changes in circumstances including changes in market prices and interest rates up to 31 december 2005. the results of this updated valuation as at 31 december 2005, for the purposes of the additional disclosures required by IAs 19, are set out below.
the post-retirement healthcare benefits are the provision of healthcare to retired employees and their dependants who were employed before 1 January 1998. employees who have 10 years of service at the age of 58 and retire are eligible to participate in the post-retirement healthcare benefit plans.
the plan is self-funded and there are no plan assets from which the costs are paid.
the cost of providing retiree healthcare is actuarially determined and accrued over the service period of the active employee group Membership of this plan is multi-national, although most staff are currently employed in the united Kingdom.
the obligation under these plans was determined by the application of the terms of medical plans, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates.
the long-term rate of medical expense inflation used in the actuarial calculations is 4.0% and 3.0% per annum in excess of the rate of general price inflation of 2.85% and 2.75%.
the discount rate used in determining the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was 4.75% and 5.3% at 31 december 2005 and 2004. the principal actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension and post-retirement healthcare benefits liabilities under IAs 19 are: As at 31 As at 31 December december 2005 2004 discount rate 4.75% 5.30% expected return on plan assets 7.31% 7.47% Future salary increases 4.85% 4.75% Medical cost trend rate 6.85% 5.75% Future pension increases 2.85% 2.75% the assets held in respect of the defined benefit scheme and the expected rates of return were: As at 31 December 2005 Long-term Percentage rate of return Value of total expected US$ in plan assets % millions % equities 7.60 25.3 90.85 cash 3.85 0.1 0.3 Bonds 4.45 2.5 8.85 Fair value of scheme assets 27.9 INMARSAT PLC AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2005 70 UNiqUely placed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements As at 31 december 2004 long-term percentage rate of return Value of total expected us$ in plan assets % millions % equities 7.75 19.7 90.34 Gilts 4.60 0.9 4.07 Bonds 5.30 1.1 4.95 cash 3.75 0.1 0.64 Fair value of scheme assets 21.8 Amounts recognised in the Balance sheet are: As at As at 31 December 31 december us$ in millions 2005 2004 present value of funded defined benefit obligations pension 46.6 37.6 present value of unfunded defined benefit obligations post-retirement healthcare 18.5 13.3 Fair value of defined benefit assets 27.9 21.8 Net defined benefit liability recognised in balance sheet 37.2 29.1 Analysis of the movement in the present value of the defined benefit obligations is as follows: defined postbenefit retirement pension medical us$ in millions plan benefits At 1 January 2004 25.4 10.1 current service cost 3.4 0.5 Interest cost 1.4 0.6 Actuarial loss 4.1 1.6 Foreign exchange loss 2.3 0.6 Benefits paid 0.1 0.1 contributions by pension participants expensed as salaries 1.1 At 31 December 2004 37.6 13.3 current service cost 3.4 0.5 Interest cost 1.9 0.7 Actuarial loss 6.9 5.7 Foreign exchange gain 4.1 1.5 Benefits paid 0.1 0.2 contributions by pension participants expensed as salaries 1.0 At 31 December 2005 46.6 18.5 Analysis of the movement in the fair value of the assets of the defined benefit section of the uK scheme is as follows: us$ in millions 2005 2004 At 1 January 21.8 15.7 expected return on plan assets 1.6 1.3 Actuarial gain 3.9 0.2 contributions by employer 2.1 2.3 contributions by pension participants expensed as salaries 1.0 1.1 Benefits paid 0.1 0.1 Foreign exchange gain loss 2.4 1.3 At 31 December 27.9 21.8 INMARSAT PLC AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2005 71 UNiqUely placed Amounts recognised in the Income statement in respect of the plans are as follows: 2005 2004 Defined Postdefined postbenefit retirement benefit retirement pension healthcare pension healthcare us$ in millions plan benefits plan benefits current service cost 3.4 0.5 3.4 0.5 Interest cost 1.9 0.7 1.4 0.6 expected return on pension assets 1.6 1.3 Foreign exchange gain loss 1.7 1.5 1.0 0.7 2.0 0.3 4.5 1.8 Actual return on plan assets 5.6 1.5 the charge for the year has been included in employee benefit costs.

the healthcare cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Income statement in respect of the post-retirement medical benefits.
Increasing the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point would have increased the post-retirement medical benefit obligation as of 31 december 2005 and 2004 by us$4.2 million and us$2.8 million and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost by us$0.3 million and us$0.3 million, respectively.
decreasing the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point would have reduced the post-retirement medical benefit obligation as of 31 december 2005 and 2004 us$3.3 million and us$2.2 million, and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost by us$0.2 million and us$0.2 million, respectively.

Financial instruments Treasury management and strategy the Groups treasury activities are managed by its corporate finance department under the direction of a treasury Review committee whose chairman is the chief Financial officer, and are consistent with Board-approved treasury policies and guidelines.
the overriding objective of treasury activities is to manage financial risk.
Key features of treasury management include: ensuring that the Group is in a position to fund its obligations in appropriate currencies as they fall due: maintaining adequate undrawn borrowing facilities: economically hedging both contracted and anticipated foreign currency cash flows on a minimum twelve-month rolling basis with the option of covering exposures up to a maximum of three years forward: and maximising return on short-term investments.
treasury activities are only transacted with counter parties who are approved relationship banks.
treasury policy is implemented primarily through the use of forward purchases of foreign currencies.
the treasury department is, however, authorised to use purchased options, futures and other derivative instruments, but only to the extent that such instruments form part of the hedging policy so as to establish a known rate of exchange.
Having arranged the purchase of foreign currency in line with the anticipated requirement for that currency over each financial year, an average rate of exchange is calculated from the agreed currency deals.
this average rate is applied for accounting purposes.
the policy is designed to minimise the impact of currency gains and losses in the profit and loss account: gains and losses will arise to the extent that the level of actual payments in the period is different from those that were forecast.
adoption of iaS 32 and iaS 39 the Group adopted IAs 32 Financial Instruments: presentation and disclosure and IAs 39 Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement from 1 January 2005.
In the preparation of its financial statements in accordance with IFRs for the 2004 financial year, the Group continued to apply the accounting rules of uK GAAp, taking advantage of the exemption available within IFRs 1 First time adoption of IFRs.
the Group is required to recognise transitional adjustments in accounting for its financial instruments in accordance with the measurement requirements of IAs 39 at 1 January 2005. the Group qualifies to hedge account for a number of its hedging arrangements.
IFRs 1 requires the Group to recognise various transitional adjustments to account for those hedging relationships at 1 January 2005. the accounting for those hedging relationships at transition depends on the nature of the hedged item and the hedged risk.
detailed below is a reconciliation between the IFRs restated Balance sheet as at 31 december 2004, applying uK GAAp accounting, and the Balance sheet after the adoption of both IAs 32 and IAs 39.
INMARSAT PLC AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2005 73 UNiqUely placed the Groups interest rate swap and forward exchange contracts were previously not accounted for as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions under uK GAAp and as such were not previously measured at fair value.
on transition, the derivatives fair values have been recognised on the Balance sheet and directly in reserves.
Any deferred gains or losses will be recognised in future earnings at the time at which the hedged forecasted transaction is recognised.
All derivative instruments will continue to be recognised on the Balance sheet at fair value with future gains and losses being recognised immediately in earnings, except when the hedging requirements of IAs 39 are met.

INMARSAT PLC AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2005 74 UNiqUely placed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Net fair values of derivative financial instruments the Groups derivative financial instruments consist of an interest rate swap, forward foreign currency contracts and forward accrual contracts.
the interest rate swap and approximately 80% of forward foreign currency contracts are designated cash flow hedges.
the net fair values at the Balance sheet date were: As at As at 31 December 31 december us$ in millions 2005 2004 contracts with positive fair values: Interest rate swap designated cash flow hedge 2.3 1.6 Forward foreign currency contracts designated cash flow hedges 10.7 Forward foreign currency contracts undesignated 1.7 contracts with negative fair values: Forward foreign currency contracts designated cash flow hedges 2.9 Forward foreign currency contracts undesignated 1.0 1.6 14.0 Less non-current portion Interest rate swap designated cash flow hedge 1.6 Forward foreign currency contracts designated 0.3 3.1 Forward foreign currency contracts and designated cash flow hedges 1.7 Current portion 1.3 7.6 the fair value of the interest rate swap is based upon a valuation provided by the counter-party.
the fair value of foreign exchange contracts are based upon the difference between the contract amount at the current forward rate at each period end and the contract amount at the contract rate, discounted at a variable risk free rate at the period end.
Forward foreign exchange As at 31 december 2005 the face value of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts was 97.7 million net fair value us$3.9 million with the balance of 30.0 million face value maturing in 2007 us$0.7 million net fair value.
during 2005 the Group transacted spot and forward foreign exchange contracts as well as two forward accrual contracts whereby the Group agreed to buy a strip of 12 monthly forward contracts at a fixed rate and at an agreed knock out rate.
If the spot exchange rate trades at or above the knock out rate at any time from the trade date and final determination date then each contract expiring on or after such date will automatically terminate.
interest rate swap the notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contract as at 31 december 2005 was us$150 million 2004: us$536 million.
under the interest rate swap the Group receives quarterly floating interest three month usd lIBoR to offset floating interest payable on the three month facility rollovers and pays quarterly interest at a fixed rate of 3.21% p. a. the gain deferred in equity will reverse in the Income statement when the swap expires in december 2006.
Non derivative financial assets and financial liabilities non derivative financial assets consist of cash at bank, short term and long-term investments, trade debtors and other debtors.
non derivative financial liabilities consist of bank overdrafts, deferred satellite payments, senior credit Facilities, senior discount notes, senior notes, accrued and accreted interest on borrowings, trade creditors and other creditors.
Fair value of non derivative financial assets and financial liabilities With the exception of senior discount notes and senior notes, the fair values of all non derivative financial instruments approximate to the carrying value in the Balance sheet.

this carrying amount approximately equals fair value: d senior notes and senior discount notes are reflected in the Balance sheet as at 31 december 2005 net of unamortised arrangement costs of us$10.6 million and us$8.7 million, respectively 2004: us$18.9 million and us$9.7 million, respectively.
the fair value of the senior notes and the senior discount notes is based on the market price of the bonds as at 31 december 2005: e senior credit Facilities are reflected in the Balance sheet as at 31 december 2005 net of unamortised arrangement costs of us$2.3 million 2004: us$21.7 million.
the fair value approximates the carrying value: f the fair value of the subordinated preference certificates repaid in 2005 was based on the accreted principal and currency revaluation of the book value of the certificates at the year end as this was the best approximation of fair value given that these certificates were not traded.
Capital commitments the Group had authorised and contracted but not provided for capital commitments as at 31 december 2005 and 31 december 2004 of us$119.2 million and us$246.6 million respectively.
these amounts primarily represent commitments in respect of the construction of the Inmarsat-4 satellites.

the cumulative actuarial loss of us$5.7 million for the 2004 financial year in relation to the above pension scheme and post-retirement medical plan was charged to the Groups equity in line with the amendment to IAs 19. the Groups IFRs Balance sheet reflects the liabilities of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme and post-retirement medical plan totalling us$15.8 million and us$13.3 million respectively.
the Group recognised a transitional adjustment from uK GAAp to IFRs of us$2.0 million to opening reserves at 1 January 2004 of the net liabilities of the Groups post-retirement medical plan.
the Group also recognised a charge to the Income statement of us$1.9 million and a corresponding us$0.6 million tax credit for the 2004 financial year from the adoption of IAs 19. the Groups pension and post-retirement medical plan liabilities are recognised gross of tax on the Balance sheet.
b Foreign currency translation In applying IAs 21, the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates the Group is required to translate all outstanding foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities on the Balance sheet at the closing rate.
under uK GAAp, all hedged assets and liabilities were recorded at the 2005 hedged rate as at 31 december 2004.
Accordingly, the Group grossed up all hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities outstanding as at 31 december 2004 from their 2005 hedged rate to the closing year-end exchange rate.
the corresponding hedge asset or liability has been recognised on the Balance sheet as at 31 december 2004, resulting in no impact on the Income statement.
c intangible assets In adopting IAs 38, Intangible assets the Group does not amortise goodwill, instead it is subject to an annual impairment review.
under uK GAAp goodwill is amortised over 20 years.
As the Group has elected not to apply IFRs 3 retrospectively to business combinations prior to transition date under IFRs, the uK GAAp goodwill balance at 31 december 2003 has been included in the opening IFRs consolidated Balance sheet and is not subject to amortisation but to an annual impairment review.
the credit arising from the adoption of IAs 38 on the Groups consolidated Income statement in respect of goodwill amortisation is us$20.4 million for the 2004 financial year.
d computer software under uK GAAp, all capitalised computer software is included within tangible fixed assets on the Balance sheet.
under IFRs, only computer software that is integral to a related item of hardware should be included as property, plant and equipment.
All other computer software should be recorded as an intangible asset.
Accordingly, an adjustment has been made in the Balance sheet as at the date of transition and as at 31 december 2004 of us$18.3 million and us$31.2 million, respectively, between property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.
e deferred income tax the scope of IAs 12, Income taxes is wider than the corresponding uK GAAp standards, and requires deferred tax to be provided on all temporary differences rather than just timing differences under uK GAAp.
As a result, the Groups IFRs opening Balance sheet at 1 January 2004 includes additional deferred tax liabilities of us$46.9 million in respect of differences between the carrying value and tax written down value of the Groups assets.
In addition a GAAp difference arises on the calculation of deferred tax on foreign subsidiaries, resulting in a us$7.2 million income tax expense for the year 2004. f Fair value adjustment on acquisition of subsidiary Adjustments to provisional fair values in 2004 have been adjusted in the uK GAAp Balance sheet as at 1 January 2004. g cumulative translation reserve the Group has applied the exemption, which allows the cumulative translation difference to be set to zero at the date of transition, for all foreign subsidiary undertakings.
INMARSAT PLC AnnuAl RepoRt And Accounts 2005 80 UNiqUely placed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements h explanation of material adjustments to the cash Flow Statement for 2004 Income taxes of us$1.1 million received during the year are classified as a part of operating cash flows under IFRs, but were included in a separate category of tax cash flows under uK GAAp.
deposits maturing after more than three months of us$100.6 million have been included in investing activities under IFRs and under uK GAAp are included in a separate line for management of liquid resources.
Arrangement costs of us$30.2 million together with the bridge rebate of us$5.5 million have been classified as financing activities under IFRs.
under uK GAAp these items are included separately under returns on investments and servicing of finance.
Interest paid of us$64.8 million together with the bridge interest paid of us$3.1 million have been classified as financing activities under IFRs.
cash and cash equivalents includes short term deposits maturing within three months of us$107.0 million under IFRs, under uK GAAp the same has been included in the management of liquid resources category.
there are no other material differences between the cash Flow statement presented under IFRs and the cash Flow statement presented under uK GAAp.
i Restatement and reclassification the Group has reclassified the 2004 current and deferred tax balances to reflect the treatment of pension and post retirement benefits under IAs 19 employee Benefits.
the impact on net assets is nil.
the Group has restated the 2004 IFRs income tax expense to account for a us$4.2 million asset recorded incorrectly on interest deductions in the prior year.
the effect of this restatement is to increase the income tax expense by us$4.2 million, with a corresponding increase to the current tax liability of us$4.2 million for the 2004 financial year.
