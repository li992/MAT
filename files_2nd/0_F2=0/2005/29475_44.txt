SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS During the year ended 31 December 2005 the Group operated a number of different equity settled share-based payment arrangements, which are aggregated as follows: SAYE plan this is a standard Inland Revenue approved scheme that is available to all employees where individuals can contribute up to 250 per month over three or five years to purchase shares at a price not less than 80% of the market price at the date of the invitation to participate.
Executive deferred bonus schemes under these plans the deferred element of the annual bonus is used to purchase shares at market value in the Company to be held in an employee trust.
The shares vest after three years and in addition to the performance targets which apply prior to any entitlement being granted, further performance conditions may also apply on vesting.
Executive performance share plan under this plan, which was introduced in 2005, two-thirds of shares are subject to an earnings growth condition of the Group and one-third of shares are subject to a comparative total shareholder return condition, both measured over a single three year period.
Further information regarding the vesting conditions of the earnings growth and total shareholder return dependent portions of the award is given in the Remuneration Report on page 40.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED Financial assumptions underlying the calculation of fair value The fair value expense has been based on the fair value of the instruments granted, as calculated using appropriate derivative pricing models.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED Notes: 1 Expected volatility is based on an analysis of the Companys historic volatility over a period typically 3 or 5 years which is commensurate with the expected term of the options or the awards.
2 Typically the vesting periods for the SAYE plan are 3 or 5 years and this results in having two fair values in the table above for awards made in 2004 and 2005.
These vesting periods may be extended by up to six months in order to catch up on missed contributions up to a maximum of 6.
3 There are two populations of the executive deferred bonus schemes, one of which is subject to performance conditions on vesting as well as the initial performance criteria which apply prior to any entitlements being granted to both populations.
There are therefore two fair values in the table above with the lower value in each case being relevant to the portion subject to further performance criteria on vesting.
4 Dividends payable on the shares during the vesting period are paid out during the vesting period for the executive deferred bonus schemes and so no dividend yield assumption is required.
5 The awards made under the executive performance share plan are dependent upon earnings growth in the Company two-thirds of the award and a total shareholder return of a comparator group of companies one-third of the award.
This results in having two fair values for each of the awards made in the table above, the first being in relation to the comparator total shareholder return and the second relating to the Companys earnings growth.
6 Awards were made under the executive performance plan on two separate occasions during 2005.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED The average share price during the year was 239.64 pence.
The SAYE plan options outstanding at 31 December 2005 had exercise prices of 72 pence, 144 pence and 194 pence and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.5 years.
The options outstanding under the executive share option schemes had exercise prices ranging from 85.5 pence to 257 pence and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.8 years.
The options outstanding under the sales management share option schemes at 31 December 2005 had exercise prices ranging from 80 pence to 248.5 pence and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.7 years.
The options outstanding under the Partner share option schemes at 31 December 2005 had exercise prices ranging from 75 pence to 253.25 pence and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.3 years.
Early exercise assumptions The following allowance has been made for the impact of early exercise once options have vested: 1 SAYE plan all option holders are assumed to exercise half-way through the six month exercise window 2 Executive, sales management and partner share option schemes it is assumed that 10% of option holders are forced to exercise their options each year irrespective of the level of the share price.
For the remainder it is assumed that one-half will exercise their options each year if the share price is at least 33% above the exercise price.
Allowance for performance conditions The executive performance share plan includes a market based performance condition based on the companys total shareholder return relative to an index of comparator companies.
The impact of this performance condition has been modelled using Monte Carlo simulation techniques, which involve running many thousands of simulations of future share price movements for both the Company and the comparator index.
For the purpose of these simulations it is assumed that the share price of the Company and the comparator index are 25% correlated and that the comparator index has volatilities ranging between 20% pa and 65% pa.
The performance condition is based on the companys performance relative to the comparator index over a three year period commencing on 1 January each year.
The fair value calculations for the awards that were made in 2005 therefore include an allowance for the actual performance of the companys share price relative to the index over the period between 1 January 2005 and 17 May 2005, the award date.
Charge to profit and loss account The table below sets out the charge to the profit and loss account in respect of the share-based payment awards that have been made since 7 November 2002: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2005 2004 Million Million Share option expense 3.0 2.3 91
