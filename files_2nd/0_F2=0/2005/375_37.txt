Aegis R&A 2005 Finance 73-100 12 4 06 7:11 am Page 4 Aegis Annual Report 2005 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 20.
Financial instruments The Group has established objectives concerning the holding and use of financial instruments which are discussed in further detail in the Treasury Management section of the Financial Review on page 22.
The key objective is to manage the financial risks faced by the Group, which are discussed below.
Formal policies and guidelines have been set to achieve this objective and it is the responsibility of Group Treasury to implement these policies using the strategies set out below.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments nor engage in speculative arrangements and it is the Groups policy not to use any complex financial instruments, unless, in exceptional circumstances, it is necessary to cover defined risks.
The Group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005.
Therefore it should be noted that the comparative information provided in this note is not comparable with the 2005 information.
Management of financial risk The Group considers its major financial risks to be currency risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.
The Groups policies with regard to these risks and the strategies concerning how financial instruments are used to manage these risks are set out below.
Currency risk A significant portion of the Groups activities take place overseas.
The Group therefore faces currency exposures on transactions undertaken by subsidiaries in foreign currencies and upon consolidation following the translation of the local currency results and net assets liabilities of overseas subsidiaries.
The Groups foreign currency management policy requires subsidiaries to hedge all transactions and financial instruments with material currency exposures.
The Group is a party to a number of foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
These are held at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The total notional amounts of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed are shown below.
2005 2004 m m Forward foreign exchange contracts 21.2 10.5 The fair values of currency derivatives included in the balance sheet are based on market values supplied by the banks through which the currency derivatives were acquired.
Movements in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts are taken to the income statement.
It is the Groups policy not to hedge exposures arising from the translation of profits or net assets as these represent an accounting rather than cash exposure.
The Groups policy is to borrow locally wherever possible to act as a natural hedge against the translation risk arising from its net investments overseas.
A currency analysis of borrowings is given below.
It is estimated that a strengthening of Sterling by 1% would reduce 2005 profit before tax by 1.2 million.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective of ensuring that adequate funding is in place is achieved by having agreed sufficient committed bank facilities.
The Group also seeks to manage its working capital requirement by requiring clients to pay for media in advance whenever possible.
At 31 December 2005, the Group had net debt before issue costs of new debt of 194.9 million 2004: 52.1 million.
The Group had cash and cash equivalents of 280.7 million at 31 December 2005 2004: 276.0 million and gross borrowings of 475.6 million 2004: 327.9 million.
The Groups principal debt instruments are subject to certain financial covenants.
Included within gross borrowings is 121.5 million 2004: 122.6 million of 2 per cent convertible bonds due in 2006.
These bonds were issued on 15 May 2002.
Also included within gross borrowings is 92.9 million US$160 million 2004: 83.0 million US$160 million of unsecured loan notes issued on 20 November 2000, which are repayable in full between 2006 and 2008, and 198.5 million US$342 million 2004: nil of unsecured loan notes issued on 28 July 2005, which are repayable in full between 2012 and 2017.
In addition to the net debt at 31 December 2005, the Group has undrawn committed facilities of 294.9 million 2004: 231.6 million.

Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Groups convertible bond and the unsecured loan notes referred to above are at fixed rates.
All other borrowings are at floating rates.
The Group has entered into long-term hedging arrangements to swap the interest relating to US$160 million of unsecured loan notes Private Placement Debt - November 2000 from fixed into floating rates.
The Group has in place cash pooling arrangements in a number of territories.
These enable the Group to minimise the interest paid on short-term borrowings and overdrafts, whilst allowing net surplus funds to be invested in interest bearing accounts.
Credit Risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and cash balances.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet in respect of trade receivables are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Trade credit risk is managed in each territory through the use of credit checks on new clients and individual credit limits, where considered necessary.
In some instances clients are required to pay for media in advance.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
Short-term debtors and creditors and currency disclosures Short-term debtors and trade creditors have been excluded from all disclosures provided in this note.
Group companies do not have material, unhedged monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currencies.
Hence, no currency risk disclosures have been provided.
Convertible bond On 15 May 2002, the Group issued 165 million of convertible bonds, due in 2006.
The bonds may be redeemed, at the option of the Company, at any time on or after 29 May 2005.
Unless previously redeemed, the bonds are convertible into ordinary 5p shares, at the option of the holder, between 25 June 2002 and 8 May 2006.
Unless previously redeemed or converted, the bonds will be redeemed on 15 May 2006 at 107.95% of their principal amount.
The initial conversion price was 149.8 pence per ordinary share and is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances relating to changes in the capital structure of the Company or a change of control.
If all the bonds were to be converted at the initial conversion price, 67.5 million ordinary shares would be issued.
Interest is payable on the bonds at 2 per cent per annum with a 1.875 per cent premium payable.
The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible bond have been split between the host contract liability element and an equity conversion component, representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group.
The equity conversion component is separately included within liabilities.
This component is then marked to market at each balance sheet date with changes in fair value being taken through the income statement.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the host contract liability component was valued at 91.1 million, excluding unamortised issue costs, and the equity conversion component was 11.9 million.
At 31 December 2005, the host contract liability component was 121.5 million 1 January 2005: 122.6 million, excluding unamortised issue costs, and the equity conversion component was nil 1 January 2005: 0.3 million.
Exchange differences arising on the re-translation of the convertible bond are taken directly to reserves as the convertible bond is used to provide a hedge against Euro-denominated investments.
Issue costs are deducted from the amount of funds received and amortised over the term of the debt.
Private Placement Debt November 2000 On 20 November 2000, the Group issued US$160 million of unsecured loan notes, repayable between 2006 and 2008.
These loan notes are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.
Interest rate swaps have been entered into for the duration of the loan notes to convert this fixed rate borrowing into floating rate based upon the US six-month LIBOR rate.
These interest rate swaps are designated as hedging instruments of interest rate risk in respect of this debt.
When the hedge relationship is effective, the carrying value of this debt is adjusted by the changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk at the balance sheet date.
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk in respect of the above borrowings being at floating rates.

Financial instruments continued Interest rate swaps The fair value of the interest rate swaps entered into at 31 December 2005 and included in the balance sheet is 3.1million 2004: nil.
The fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model and market interest yield curves applicable and represents unrecognised profits which the Group expects to realise as a result of lower variable interest payments under the swap compared with the fixed interest rate applicable on the underlying loan notes.
1.9 million of this is expected to be realised in 2006.
The interest rate swaps are designated and effective as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of the debt caused by changes in interest rates.
Movements in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are taken to the income statement where they offset against very similar but opposite movements in the fair value of the debt caused by movements in interest rates.
Private Placement Debt July 2005 On 28 July 2005, the Group issued US$342 million of unsecured loan notes, repayable between 2012 and 2017.
On 9 November 2005 cross currency swaps were entered into for US$142 million of the loan notes due in 2012 and US$50 million of the loan notes due in 2015 to convert this US$ fixed rate borrowing into EUR fixed rate borrowing.
These loan notes are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries and are used to provide a hedge against US dollardenominated investments.
To the extent that this hedging relationship is effective, exchange differences arising on the re-translation of the US$150 million of debt not impacted by the cross currency swaps are taken directly to reserves.
Cross currency swaps The fair value of the cross currency swaps entered into at 31 December 2005 is 1.6 million.
The fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model and market interest yield curves applicable and represents movements in the Euro US$ foreign exchange spot rate and in Euro and US$ interest rate yields.
The cross currency swaps are synthetically split for accounting purposes, to reflect the Groups functional currency of Sterling.
The US$ Sterling leg of the swaps act as cash flow hedges against the Groups US$ loan notes and the Euro Sterling leg of the swaps act as net investment hedges in respect of certain of the Groups Euro-denominated investments.
