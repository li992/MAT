24 Share based payments The Senior Executive Share Option Scheme was approved in 1994.
Under the scheme the remuneration committee was able to grant options over shares in the Company to senior executives of the Group, although the scheme lapsed in May 2004.
Options were granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under the option at the date of grant.
The contractual life of an option is ten years.
Options granted under the scheme will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the Groups earnings per share exceeding, by at least 3% per annum, the increase in the UKs retail price index over a period of three years beginning not earlier than the Companys last financial year before the date of an option grant.
The exercise of an option is subject to continued employment or other circumstances per the scheme rules.
Options granted since November 2002 were valued using Black-Scholes option model.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP was introduced in 1999 as an appropriate method to incentivise executives and senior management.
The LTIP consists of a right to acquire shares at nominal price of 1 which will be exercisable after a period of three years at the earliest.
The actual percentage of shares that can be acquired depends on two performance criteria.
The first of these is a comparison of the Companys total shareholder return TSR with the TSR of companies in the engineering-general sector of the FTSE All Share Index and the second is that the remuneration committee determines that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company see remuneration report for further details.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 56 57 Notes to the accounts 24 Share based payments continued The fair value per option of the LTIPs granted in the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: Grant date 27th April Share price at grant date 307p Exercise price 1 Number of employees 42 Shares under option 272,022 Vesting period years 3 Expected volatility 34.9% Option life years 10 Expected life years 3 Correlation of pair of shares in comparator group 9.7% Expected dividend expressed as a dividend yield 2.9% Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 0% Expectations of meeting performance criteria 90% Fair value per option 1.69 The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over ten years.
The expected life is the average expected to exercise.
Deloittes TSR Pricing Model was used to value TSR performance conditions for the LTIP.
The total charge for the year relating to employee share based payments plans was 0.4m 2004: 0.3m before tax and 0.3m post tax.

1.7m of brands have been transferred from goodwill in respect of acquisitions since the transition date.
b Retirement benefit schemes - Accounting for pensions in accordance with IAS 19 requires the pension asset liability to be brought onto the balance sheet.
At 31st December 2003 the Groups defined benefit pension schemes were in deficit under IAS 19 requiring a pension liability of 27.9m to be shown on the balance sheet.
At 31st December 2004 the Aga Pension Scheme showed a surplus of 1.2m which is included in assets and the other schemes deficits of 7.8m are shown in liabilities in the restated balance sheet.
At 31st December 2004 the SSAP 24 pension prepayment of 28.6m 2003: 23.3m which was included in the balance sheet has been removed under IAS 19.
Retirement benefit provisions for overseas businesses of 2.3m at 31st December 2004 2003: 2.3m were transferred from provisions to retirement benefit liabilities.
The related deferred tax has been adjusted accordingly.
The operating profit is reduced by 2.3m in the year to 31st December 2004 the IAS 19 service cost of 6.3m and net finance income of 4.0m for the full year.
c Dividends - Under UK GAAP, companies were required to provide for their final dividend in the closing balance sheet and in advance of the dividend being declared and approved by the Annual General Meeting.
Under IAS 37, Provisions the dividend cannot be provided in the year end balance sheet as, at that date, the dividend did not represent a liability.
At 31st December 2004 accrued dividends of 7.3m 2003: 6.5m were removed from other payables.
d Tax - In accordance with IAS 12, provision has been made for deferred tax on revalued assets.
This was not required under UK GAAP unless there was a binding commitment to sell the asset.
The increase in the deferred tax liability at 31st December 2004 was 0.9m 2003: 1.2m.
A deferred tax asset has also been included in respect of the IAS 19 pension liability and the deferred tax liability has been removed in relation to the SSAP 24 pension prepayment, a total pensions related tax adjustment of 10.6m on 31st December 2004 2003: 15.4m.
The total deferred tax adjustment is therefore 9.7m, split between 5.6m of deferred tax assets and 4.1m of deferred tax liabilities which are now shown gross on the face of the balance sheet.
e Goodwill - The operating profit is increased by 8.0m in the year to 31st December 2004 as goodwill amortisation is no longer required under IFRS 3 as these assets are subject to annual impairment testing.
The goodwill in the balance sheet has been frozen at 31st December 2003.
On restatement of the balance sheet under IFRS, goodwill has been adjusted by 1.7m in relation to brands on recent acquisitions that were transferred to intangibles.
f Share options - No adjustment has been made to the profit and loss charge of 0.3m in the year to 31st December 2004, under UK GAAP, in relation to share option schemes.
This is because one of the two Executive LTIP schemes is excluded from the IFRS 2 calculation, as it was granted before 7th November 2002, and one of the employee share option schemes, granted after 7th November 2002, is included, both of which have similar valuations of 0.3m.
g Share of result of associate - The share of the result post tax and after adding back goodwill amortisation under IFRS is not materially different from that shown in the profit and loss account under UK GAAP.
h Revenue recognition - Revenue has been adjusted by 1.3m to ensure settlement discounts have been presented in accordance with IAS 18, these costs were previously reported as an operating cost rather than a deduction from revenue.
