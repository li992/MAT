Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 109 iii 2002 Performance Share Plan Under this Plan, Directors and certain senior managers of the Group are awarded conditional awards over Ordinary Shares in the Group.
These conditional awards may vest three years after the awards have been made subject to the satisfactory performance of a performance condition determined at the time that the conditional awards are made.
In 2003 the Group granted to the Trustee of the International Power Employee Share Ownership Trust an option to acquire 3,807,057 Ordinary Shares in the Group at an option price of 84 pence per share.
Following the Rights Issue in 2004, the number of shares under option was increased to 4,276,215 and the option exercise price was adjusted to 74.79 pence per share.
This option can only be exercised to the extent required to satisfy conditional awards made under the Performance Share Plan.
These conditional awards can only vest after the end of the relevant performance period and only to the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied.
The above option of 4,276,215 on the Ordinary Shares remained outstanding and unexercised at 31 December 2003, 2004 and 2005 at an exercise price of 74.79 pence per share.
The life of this option is open-ended.
It is anticipated that this share option will be utilised to satisfy the release of awards made under the 2002 Performance Share Plan from 2006 onwards.
Assuming full vesting of the awards made as at 31 December 2005, it is estimated that this option will have been fully exercised by the end of 2008. b Fair value of options under Share Option Plans i Sharesave plans No savings related options were awarded during the current or prior year.
ii Executive Share Options Plans The estimated fair value of the options granted during the year was 47 pence 2004: 32 pence.
These fair values were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs into the model were as follows: 2005 2004 Weighted average share price 179p 124p Weighted average exercise price 179p 124p Expected volatility 30% 30% Expected life 4 years 4 years Risk free rate 4.84% 4.55% Expected dividend yield 1.94% 1.94% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous six years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

c Managers share bonus arrangements During 2004, 571,710 shares in International Power were acquired in respect of a project incentive arrangement for staff excluding Executive Directors for a consideration of 887,497.
