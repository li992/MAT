If sufficient suitable profits arise in the future, then these losses could be utilised and hence reduce the future tax charge.
There are certain tax credits which may be available to reduce future tax charges but which have not been recognised.
If subsequently these credits are actually available then this would lead to reductions in future tax charges.
A discussion of the Groups tax charge can be found in the Financial Review on pages 10 to 12.
