6 Harcourt Education Shelly Arneson, School Principal, manages the formative education of hundreds of children.
We help Shelly and her team with Stanford Learning First, an online assessment tool that shows how well they are doing, diagnoses specific learning difficulties and provides extra tuition and advice as needed.
Giving young minds the right start in learning has made her school one of the best in Florida.
Harcourt Education Stanford Learning First provides integrated online assessment, reporting, and professional development.
As a web-based formative assessment system it helps teachers bridge the gap between assessment and instruction and gives immediate feedback about student performance, which helps teachers develop effective instructional strategies to target those areas where students need most help.
