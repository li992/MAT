Annual Report & Accounts 2005 128 Kazakhmys PLC Technical description of facilities in Kazakhstan Zhezkazgan Complex operations The Zhezkazgan operations comprise five underground mines Stepnoy commenced in 2005 and one operating unit of open pit surface mines North mine, including the open pit mines in the Zhilandy Licence area.
The Zhaman-Aybat mine is well developed underground and is on schedule to commence production during 2006, requiring only the completion of the rail spur.
All underground mines utilise room-and-pillar methods with pillar extraction.
The ore feeds the Satpaev and the two Zhezkazgan concentrators and is subsequently processed to final product in the form of cathode copper in the smelter at Zhezkazgan and copper rod in the Kazkat plant.
The slimes containing silver are sent to the Balkhash Complex for processing to final product.
Balkhash Complex operations The Balkhash Complex operations comprise two surface mines and two underground mines.
One of the open pits employs conventional shovel and truck with rail haulage Kounrad and one with hydraulic excavators and trucks Nurkazgan.
The two underground mines employ continuous retreat sub-level caving Shatyrkul and multi-lift room-and-pillar methods of mining Sayak I and Sayak III.
Kounrad is scheduled to suspend production from 2006 through to 2009, to accommodate a major push-back of the pit walls, which will enable long-term production plans from 2009.
Two new surface projects are also planned to come into production subject to completion of feasibility studies, Aktogay and Boschekul.
Both are open pits with concentrators.
The ore is railed to the Balkhash concentrator and is subsequently processed to final product in the form of cathode copper and a small quantity of copper wire in the smelter at Balkhash.
The smelter and refinery also process all copper concentrate railed from the East Region operations.
The zinc concentrates from the East Region are treated at the newly commissioned hydrometallurgical plant which has still to ramp up its capacity during 2006.
The slimes, containing gold and silver, from the refining process are processed in the precious metals plant.
East Region operations The East Region operations comprise five underground mines employing cemented rock fill mining Orlovskoe, Artemyevskoe, shrinkage stoping Belousovskoe, Irtyshskoe, room-and-pillar Belousovskoe and sub-level caving mining  methods and two shovel and truck open pit mines Nikolaevskoe, Abyz.
These operations feed five copper zinc concentrators Orlovskoe mine to Orlovskoe: Belousovskoe mine to Belousovskoe: Irtyshskoe mine to Irtyshskoe: Nikolaevskoe mine and  mine to Nikolaevskoe, Abyz mine to Karagaily.
Planned production from the new Kosmurun surface mine has been brought forward and will be introduced during 2006, and the adjacent Akbastau mine is planned to come into production in 2007, both feeding the Karagaily concentrator.
In both these new mines initial production is planned from surface mining, but in both cases underground operations will be developed to secure long-term production plans.
The East Region concentrate is railed to Balkhash and blended with that from Balkhash.
Other operations in Kazakhmys Kazakhmys LLC also produces sulphuric acid at Zhezkazgan.
On completion of the new plant at Balkhash in 2006, sulphuric acid will be produced in noticeable quantities for a ready market.
Kazakhmys LLC has been buying copper concentrate for processing and sale, and also has been toll-smelting copper concentrate.
Kazakhmys LLC will continue to purchase quantities of copper concentrate in the future to optimise the throughput of the smelter.
When projects come on stream later this decade, Kazakhmys LLC is expected to become a net seller of concentrate.
Kazakhmys LLC has been selling zinc in concentrate to KazZinc in the past but this will be treated in Balkhash in the future.
A proportion of the zinc in concentrate, excess to the zinc plant capacity, will continue to be sold.
Kazakhmys LLC is also involved in toll-processing precious metals.

In practice, this means that the statements of reserves and resources developed by Kazakhmys LLC and the mining plans to which they relate must be submitted for approval to the corresponding committees of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources for which adherence to the standardised national system of reserves and resources estimation is mandatory.
As part of the exploitation licence for each mineral deposit, a set of Conditions for Estimation of Reserves were prepared by the corresponding national design institute and were approved within the national formerly USSR State Plan.
The Conditions apply a well-defined process of classifying the specific deposit into one of five major deposit categories, subject to which, the principles for exploration and classification of reserves and resources have been established.
The Conditions for Estimation of Reserves for each deposit specify the method of computation of reserve blocks, the minimum thickness for exploitation of the ore body and cut-off grades, plus special considerations which may apply where the conditions for mineral extraction are exceptional or present difficulties.
Reserves and resources have been estimated by Kazakhmys LLC according to the FSU Classification and Estimation Methods for Reserves and Resources.
Further details on the estimation methodology of reserves and resources adopted by Kazakhmys LLC can be found in the Price Range Prospectus.
IMC has reviewed the reserves and resources statements of Kazakhmys LLC and has restated the reserves and resources in accordance with JORC.
A copy of IMCs report addressed to the Directors relating to the scope and result of their review can be found on page 145.
All reserves quoted in the following tables are discounted for ore losses and dilution.
Resources are not discounted for losses and dilution and are inclusive of reserves.
All figures in reserves and resources are in metric tonnes and are dated 31 December 2005.

Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Kazakhmys PLC 143 Changes in the reserves and resources base during 2005 T The total measured and indicated resources of Kazakhmys LLC have increased during 2005 to a total of 2,957 M, as compared to T 2,790 M as at 31 December 2004.
This increase is primarily due to the working up and refinement of resource definition data at three sites.
Relevant reserve categories under the Kazakhstan national system have been approved by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.
New underground mining projects in the Zhilandy area of the Zhezkazgan region have now been included, further resources have been defined at the Aktogay project and, as a result of on-going exploration, further resources have been identified at Nurkazgan mine.
Changes in reserves and resource totals for the mining operational regions are summarised in tables 1 and 2.
This reflects an important redistribution of reserves between some of the major mining units and a revised treatment of those reserves categorised as inactive, which are situated in protection pillars under surface structures and shafts, or are otherwise not available for immediate extraction without geomechanical studies and decisions on potential damage to surface and mine infrastructure.
The redistribution of reserves has been undertaken for operational reasons to allocate reserve blocks to those mines which have the T best developed infrastructure for efficient extraction.
The most important transfer has been of 13.4 M from South mine to Stepnoy mine.
However, for long-life underground operations such as Stepnoy mine, it has been considered prudent to consider as reserves only that tonnage which falls within the current long-term production schedule through to 2025.
As a consequence, an important part of the newly increased resource base of Stepnoy mine represents previously assessed reserves which, due to the long-term perspective for working, are reallocated only as resources.
A review of the status of inactive reserves has taken the conservative view that these are not available for extraction at the present time and should be considered only as resources until the conditions for their extraction are confirmed by near-term operational planning, at which stage they will transfer to reserve status.
The review of inactive reserves has impacted reserves totals in Annensky, East, Stepnoy and West mines.
T The total resource base for the Zhezkazgan Complex has increased by 106.8 M. This reflects the inclusion in the resource base of the Zhilandy underground mine prospects.
This group of projects includes the East Saryoba deposit currently under construction.
The new resources have been defined through detailed evaluation of exploration data and have been categorised within the Kazakh national reserves classification under the standard procedure which requires approval by committees of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.
Balkhash Complex T The total of proven and probable reserves has increased by 61 M over the 12 month period.
This is due to increases in the reserves of Nurkazgan mine and the Aktogay project.
All other units in the Balkhash Complex have undergone depletion of their reserves in line with the level of production in the period.
Exploration at Nurkazgan has continued through the period and plans for development have undergone review.
Important long-term production is now planned from an underground operation beneath the current open pit and an access decline is under construction.
Open pit reserves now under extraction through to the end of 2007 have been reallocated to the proved reserve category.
Reserves are incorporated for new open pit areas and for those blocks which are sufficiently known and planned for underground working.
The greater T part of the new resource base relates to new areas for open pit working.
An overall increase is recorded in the resource base of 52.5 M. T Aktogay project, currently undergoing feasibility studies, has been the subject of continuing review and a further 16 M of probable reserves have been defined on the basis of existing exploration data and current mine planning.
East Region The depletion of reserves and the overall resource base is in direct relation to the ore extraction and production achieved by each of the operating mines during the 12 month period.
