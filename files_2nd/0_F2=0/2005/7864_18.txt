Significant accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the financial statements, except as noted below.
In these financial statements the following new standards have been adopted for the first time: FRS20 Share-based payments: FRS21 Events after the balance sheet date: FRS25 Financial instruments: presentation and disclosure: and FRS26 Financial instruments: measurement.
The accounting policies under these new standards are set out below.
The effects of adopting these new standards are set out in note C10.
The corresponding amounts in these financial statements are restated in accordance with the new policies.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
The Company has not presented a separate profit and loss account as permitted by Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1, the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that the Company is included in its own published consolidated financial statements.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions contained in FRS8 Related party disclosures and has not disclosed transactions or balances with entities which form part of the Group.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation included in the profit and loss account.
Taxation Except where otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for the tax on all timing differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.

Basis of accounting continued Pensions and post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of pension plans throughout the world which cover the majority of group employees.
With certain exceptions referred to in the notes relating to the financial statements the funds of the plans are administered by Trustees and are separate from the Group.
Valuations are normally carried out every three years by independent actuaries and annual contributions are paid to the plans in accordance with their recommendations.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated so as to spread the cost of pensions over the average remaining service life of the employees in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
The amount charged in respect of defined contribution plans is in accordance with the rules of the plans.
The Company participates in a pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the company.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS17 Retirement benefits: accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contribution payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Financial instruments To qualify as a hedge, a financial instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or to a probable commitment.
It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
Gains and losses arising on these contracts are deferred and recognised in the profit and loss account, or as adjustments to the carrying amount of fixed assets, only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in the Groups accounts.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at that time.
Equity and equity-related compensation benefits The Company operates an Executive Share Option Scheme, a SAYE Share Option Scheme and a Performance Share Plan.
For options granted on or after 7 November 2002, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense each year.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, profitability and sales growth targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
The fair value of the options is determined based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Dividends or shares presented within shareholders funds Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
Remuneration of directors The detailed information concerning directors emoluments, shareholdings and options are shown in the Remuneration Report on pages 38 to 46.
All directors of the Company are also directors of the Group.
Staff numbers and costs With the exception of the directors, the number of people employed by the Company during the year was nil 2004: nil.

Under FRS21: Events after the balance sheet date, dividends are not reflected in the financial statements until approved by shareholders.
Shareholders equity at 1 January 2004 has therefore been adjusted, for the 2003 final dividend which had not been approved at that date.
The impact of FRS25: Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, reflects the adjustment to fair value at the 1 January 2004 balance sheet date of certain financial instruments.

Contingencies The European Commission is investigating allegations of anti-competitive behaviour among certain manufacturers of copper fittings.
Notwithstanding IMI's disposal of its Copper Fittings businesses in 2002, it retains responsibility in relation to the European Commission's investigations in respect of those businesses.
A Statement of Objections was issued by the Commission in September 2005.
It is not possible to give any reliable estimate of the likely level of fine, a decision on which is not expected until 2006.
Group contingent liabilities relating to guarantees in the normal course of business and other items amounted to 45.5m 2004:41.2m.
There is a right of set-off with four of the Company's bankers relating to the balances of the Company and a number of its wholly-owned UK subsidiaries.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the financial statements for the period commencing 1 January 2006.
Acquisitions On 6 March 2006 the Company acquired the whole share capital of Truflo Group for an enterprise value of 113m.
