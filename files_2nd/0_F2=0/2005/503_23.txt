Company Accounting Policies Accounting convention These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modied by the revaluation of certain financial instruments in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards.
A summary of the more important Company accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
Changes in accounting policies The Company has adopted FRS 17, Retirement benets, FRS 20, Share-based payment, FRS 21, Events after the balance sheet date, FRS 23, The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, FRS 25, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, FRS 26, Financial Instruments: Measurement and FRS 28, Corresponding amounts, in these Accounts.
The adoption of each of these standards represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative gures have been restated accordingly except where the exemption to restate comparatives has been taken.
Details of the effect of the prior year adjustments are given in Note 46.
Tangible xed assets Tangible xed assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes purchase price, and directly attributable costs of bringing the assets into the location and condition where it is capable for use.
Borrowings costs are not capitalised.
Fixed assets are depreciated on a straight line basis at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of each asset over its useful life from the date it is available for use.
The principal period of depreciation used is as follows: Vehicles, plant and equipment 4 to 15 years.
Impairment of tangible xed assets Tangible xed assets are depreciated and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is calculated using estimated cashows.
These are discounted using an appropriate long-term pre tax interest rate.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiable cash ows cash-generating units.
Foreign currencies At individual company level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the day the transaction occurs.
At the year end, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets are translated at the historical rate.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Companys financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys presentational currency.
Derivative financial instruments The accounting policy is identical to that applied by the consolidated Group as set out on page 65.
The Company is taking advantage under FRS 25 to apply FRS 25 prospectively from 1 January 2005.
Cash ow statement and related party disclosures The Company is included in the Group Accounts of Aggreko plc, which are publicly available.
Consequently, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash ow statement under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 1 Cash Flow Statements revised 1996.
The Company is also exempt under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 8 Related Party Disclosures from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of the Group.

Company Accounting Policies continued Taxation The charge for ordinary taxation is based on the profit loss for the year and takes into account full provision for deferred tax, using the approach set out in FRS 19, Deferred Tax in respect of timing differences on a non discounted basis.
Such timing differences arise primarily from the differing treatment for taxation and accounting purposes of provisions and depreciation of xed assets.
Pensions The Company operates both a dened benefit pension scheme and a dened contribution pension scheme.
The accounting policy is identical to that applied by the consolidated Group as set out on page 67.
Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the balance sheet of the Company at cost, or nominal value of the shares issued as consideration where applicable, less provision for any impairment in value.
Share-based payments recharged to subsidiary undertakings are treated as capital contributions and are added to investments.
Leases Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Company are classied as operating leases.
Rentals under operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Grants Capital grants in respect of additions to xed assets are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the estimated operational lives of the related assets.
Share-based payments The accounting policy is identical to that applied by the consolidated Group as set out on page 68 with the exception that shares issued by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries for which no consideration is received are treated as an increase in the Companys investment in those subsidiaries.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends approved by the Companys shareholders.

Financial instruments i Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Companys financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2005.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.

Current borrowings and overdrafts Liquid resources The fair value of liquid resources and current borrowings and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Non-current borrowings In the case of bank loans and other loans, the fair value approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are oating rate where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.

Prior year adjustment and impact of new standards The prior year adjustment relates to the implementation of FRS 17, FRS 20 and FRS 21, while FRS 23, FRS 25 and FRS 26, do not affect comparatives and are only applied to the current period.
The Company is taking advantage of the transitional rules under FRS 25 to apply FRS 25 prospectively from 1 January 2005.
The adoption of FRS 17 has resulted in an increase in staff costs 0.1 million 2004: 0.3 million, a minimal impact on the tax charge in the current year 2004: 0.1 million decrease, a decrease in profit for the year by 0.1 million 2004: 0.2 million and a decrease in total recognised gains and losses by 5.5 million 2004: 1.0 million.
As at 1 January 2004 the pension scheme deficit of 5.9 million net of the related deferred tax asset of 2.5 million was brought on balance sheet.
At the same time the SSAP 24 prepayment of 0.6 million and related deferred tax liability of 0.3 million were transferred to profit and loss reserve.
The adjustment to opening shareholders funds as at 1 January 2005 comprises the pension scheme deficit of 7.1 million net of deferred tax of 3.1 million as well as the SSAP 24 prepayment of 0.6 million and related deferred tax liability of 0.3 million.
An analysis of the impact of FRS 17 on prior year results and net assets is shown below: million Adjustment to opening shareholders funds at 1 January 2004 6.2 Adjustment to profit and loss for the year ended 31 December 2004 0.2 Adjustment to statement of total recognised gains and losses for the year ended 31 December 2004 1.0 Adjustment to opening shareholders funds at 1 January 2005 7.4 The adoption of FRS 20 has resulted in a reclassication of 1.8 million 2004: 0.8 million from amounts due from subsidiary undertakings to investments.
This reclassication relates to share-based payments recharged to subsidiary undertakings which are treated as capital contributions and are added to investments.
Previously these were included in amounts due from subsidiary undertakings.
The adoption of FRS 21 has resulted in an increase in shareholder funds of 9.5 million at 1 January 2005 2004: 9.2 million due to the write back of the final dividend proposed at 31 December 2004.
The adoption of FRS 25 has no impact on reported profits although, the prospective application of the standard results in two balance sheet reclassications.
Firstly, a non-interest bearing intercompany receivable amounting to 47.0 million has been reclassied from intercompany to investments in 2005 and secondly, authorised preference shares have been disclosed as debt rather than equity.
However, as the Companys preference shares are not issued at 31 December 2005, this second presentational change has no impact on reported shareholders funds.
The adoption of FRS 23 has no material impact on the Accounts.
To reect the adoption of FRS 26, there is an adjustment of 0.2 million to equity on 1 January 2005 to bring the fair value of the derivative financial instruments on balance sheet.
