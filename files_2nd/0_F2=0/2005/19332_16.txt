Pillar Property PLC Annual report and accounts 2005 Notes to the financial statements 36 1 Accounting policies Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost accounting rules as modied by the revaluation of investment properties and investment in subsidiaries and in accordance with applicable accounting standards consistently applied in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 except as noted below under investment properties.
Basis of consolidation The group accounts include the accounts of the company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 March 2005.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the group has a long-term interest and over which it exercises joint control.
The groups share of the profits less losses of joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
Purchased goodwill both positive and negative arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions before 1 April 1998, when FRS10 Goodwill and intangible assets was adopted, was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition.
When a subsequent disposal occurs any related goodwill previously written off to reserves is written back through the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Purchased goodwill representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given and associated costs over the fair value to the separable net assets acquired arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions since 1 April 1998 is capitalised.
Positive goodwill is amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful life, normally 20 years.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business acquired since 1 April 1998, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging the unamortised amount of any related goodwill.
Investment properties Completed investment properties are revalued annually on the basis of open market value.
Investment properties under development are revalued annually by the directors based on formal external assessments of gross development value given to the directors by the groups valuers.
Surpluses and deficits on revaluation are taken to the revaluation reserve, except for those deficits expected to be permanent, which are included in the profit and loss account for the year.
In accordance with SSAP 19, no depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties.
Leasehold investment properties are not depreciated where the unexpired term is over 20 years.
This treatment for certain of the companys investment properties represents a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 concerning depreciation of xed assets.
However, these properties are not held for consumption but for investment and the directors consider that systematic annual depreciation would be inappropriate.
The accounting policy adopted is therefore, in the opinion of the directors, necessary for the accounts to give a true and fair view.
Depreciation or amortisation is only one of the factors reected in the annual valuation, and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identied or quantied.
Purchases and sales of investment properties and properties held for resale are recorded when contracts have been exchanged by the year end, and are wholly unconditional by the date of approval of the accounts.
Surpluses and deficits realised on sales of properties, calculated by comparing net sales proceeds with book values, are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Gains arising in the current year on the sale of the groups properties to unit trusts are recognised in the profit and loss account pro rata to that proportion of the total proceeds received in cash.
The gains relating to that proportion received in units are taken to the revaluation reserve.
Investment in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at directors valuation which represent the underlying net asset value.
Development properties Development properties are included at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost includes directly attributable costs together with interest on specic external debt.
profits on sales are recognised when the overall profitability of the development can be reasonably foreseen.
Depreciation Tangible xed assets are depreciated by equal instalments over their expected lives.
The rates used are: Vehicles and equipment 25% Furniture and ttings 10% Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS19.
Operating Lease Incentives Rent frees given to tenants are amortised over the earlier of either the period of the lease, or, to when the rent is adjusted to the prevailing market rate, usually the first rent review.
Capital contributions given to tenants are shown as a debtor, and amortised over the earlier of either the period of the lease, or, to when the rent is adjusted to the prevailing market rate, usually the first rent review.
The valuation of the properties is reduced by the total of the unamortised capital contributions and rent frees.
On the disposal of properties, the unamortised rent incentives are charged against rental income and the balance of the unamortised capital contributions are charged to the disposal of investment properties.
Foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in sterling at the rates ruling on the date of those transactions.
Exchange differences arising in the ordinary course of trading are included in the profit and loss account.
For the purposes of consolidation, the balance sheet and profit and loss accounts of subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures and where appropriate their branches, that are denominated in foreign currencies, are translated at the rates of exchange ruling on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising on these translations are taken to the revaluation reserve, net of exchange differences arising on related foreign currency borrowings.
Pillar Property PLC Annual report and accounts 2005 37 1 Accounting policies continued Leasing Rentals on operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Turnover Turnover, which is stated net of VAT, is derived from sale proceeds of development properties, together with net rental income from operations in the United Kingdom and Europe.
Hedging costs Hedging costs are amortised over the life of the hedging instruments and the element not amortised is included within prepayments.
Pension costs The company makes payments to individual pension schemes on behalf of certain employees on a xed percentage contribution basis.
Interest Interest incurred on loans specic to properties in the course of development is capitalised.
Interest is capitalised only during the development phase and ceases to be capitalised once the development is completed and ready for occupation.
All other interest is charged to the profit and loss account.

KPMG LLP has been appointed as the groups tax adviser and agent as this is considered to be the most cost-efficient means to access the specialist tax advice which Pillar requires, given the size and complexity of the transactions which the group undertakes: such advice necessarily requires a detailed knowledge of the groups structure and corporate history.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the level of the fees paid to the auditors and its afliates, to ensure that the auditors independence is not compromised.

On a diluted basis, the weighted average number of ordinary shares was 100,084,479 2004 109,932,190.
The difference between weighted average number of shares on a basic and diluted basis is due to the effect of unexercised share options.
