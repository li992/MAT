The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2005 of 21p per share which will absorb an estimated 152m of shareholders funds.
It will be paid on 25 May 2006 to shareholders who are on the register on 3 March 2006.

Accordingly, the cost is spread over the three years of the performance period.
Other share awards have contractual lives of either three, five or seven years.
Performance criteria: Executive Share Awards are subject to performance criteria based on compound average annual growth CAAG rates in earnings per share over the performance period.
Other Share Awards are generally not subject to any criteria other than the employees continued employment.
Executive Share Awards included in the above table vest as follows: CAAG of 6%: 40% of awards vest: 7% CAAG: 60%: 8% CAAG: 80%: 9% CAAG: 100%.
The assumptions made within the valuation calculation with respect to the achievement of performance criteria are based on the Directors expectations in light of the Groups business model and relevant published targets.
Under the terms of the Plans, early exercise is not permitted therefore the effect of early exercise is not incorporated into the calculation.
The calculation also asssumes that there will be no leavers in the following year.
No material modifications have been made to the Plans in 2004 or 2005 for the purposes of the valuation.
Volatility: An estimate of future volatility is made with reference to historical volatility over a similar time period, to the performance period or the contractual life as appropriate.
Historical volatility is calculated based on the annualised standard deviation of the Groups daily share price movement, being an approximation to the continuously compounded rate of return on the share.
Income statement charge: the income statement charge may not exactly equal one third of the total fair value included in the table above due to adjustments for in-year lapses or award revisions.
The weighted average share price for the year was 17.00 2004 14.44.
