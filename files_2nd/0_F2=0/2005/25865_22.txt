Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31st January 2005 A SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN APPLIED CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, IS SET OUT BELOW.
Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of investments.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act and with applicable accounting standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial statements of investment trust companies, as issued by the Association of Investment Trust Companies in January 2003. ii.
Valuation of investments Quoted investments are valued at middle market prices.
Where trading in the securities of an investee company is suspended, the investment is valued at the Boards estimate of its net realisable value.
Unlisted investments are valued by the Board.
In making their valuations, the Board have taken into account, where appropriate, latest dealing prices, valuations from reliable sources, asset values and other relevant factors, with consideration given to the latest British Venture Capital Association guidelines.
Realised surpluses or deficits on the disposal of investments and permanent impairments in the value of investments are taken to capital reserve realised, and unrealised surpluses and deficits on the revaluation of investments are taken to the capital reserve unrealised.
Year end exchange rates are used to translate the value of investments which are denominated in foreign currencies.
Income Dividends from equity shares are included in the revenue account on an ex-dividend basis.
UK dividends are accounted for net of any tax credits and of any tax credit on overseas income.
Overseas dividends are shown gross of withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in capital reserve unrealised.
Special dividends are recognised on an ex-dividend basis and might be considered to be capital items.
The facts and circumstances of each dividend are considered on a case-by-case basis before a conclusion on such an allocation is reached.
Interest receivable on fixed interest stocks, underwriting commission, deposit interest and interest payable is recognised in the revenue account on an accruals basis.
Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of Financial Reporting Standard 4 Capital Instruments.
Finance costs of debt insofar as they relate to the financing of the Companys investments or to financing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Companys investments are allocated 50% to capital reserve realised and 50% to revenue account, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns in the form of capital gains and income respectively from the investment portfolio of the Company.
v. Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged wholly to the revenue account except as follows: expenses which are incidental to the acquisition of an investment are included within the cost of the investment: expenses which are incidental to the disposal of an investment are deducted from the disposal proceeds of the investment: and expenses are charged to capital reserve realised where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the management fee has been allocated 50% to capital reserve realised and 50% to revenue account, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the investment portfolio of the Company.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the capital reserve realised or in the revenue account depending on whether the gain or loss is capital or revenue in nature.
Taxation Deferred tax is provided in accordance with FRS19 on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Deferred tax is recognised, in accordance with FRS19, in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred that result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less, tax in the future.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.

Financial instruments The Companys financial instruments comprise: Investments including equity shares with international exposure.
These are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies: Bank loans, debenture stocks and interest rate swaps none open at 31st January 2005 2004: same in sterling, for which the main purpose is to raise finance for the Companys operations: Short-term debtors, creditors and cash amounts arising directly from its operations: As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long-term.
Accordingly it is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no short-term trading in investments or other financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments is market price risk which incorporates both foreign currency and interest rate risk.
The Boards policy for managing these risks is summarised over the page.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the preceeding year to which these financial statements relate.
Market Price Risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential gain or loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets at least quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio in order to manage the risk associated with particular countries or industry sectors.
An individual fund manager has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk-reward profile.
Interest Rate Risk The Company finances its operations through bank borrowings and retained profits.
The Company borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then can use interest rate swaps to both generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
At the year end, the Companys borrowings were at fixed rates.
Foreign Currency Risk The value of the Companys investments can be affected by exchange rate movements as some of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys reporting currency.
The Board has identified two principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affect the value of investments: and Movements in rates affect short-term timing differences.
The Company may be subject to short-term exposure to exchange rate movement, for instance where there is a difference between the date an investment purchase or sale is entered into and the date when settlement of the proceeds occurs.
