63 Notes to the accounts continued 30 Interest rate sensitivity gap analysis Interest rate risk emanates from the Groups loan investments and the Groups funding.
The Groups policy is that fixed rate lending is matched with fixed rate borrowings and the interest rate resetting profile of variable rate lending is matched with that of variable rate borrowings through gearing the portfolio.
Financial instruments including interest rate swaps are used as part of this matching process.
Equity investments, which are mainly funded by shareholders funds but also partially by borrowings in similar currencies, give rise to an interest rate sensitivity gap as a result of the equity investments being non-interest bearing and having no fixed maturity date.
The interest rate sensitivity gap at 31 March 2005 was: More than More than More than three months six months one year but not but not but not Not more than more than more than more than More than Non-interest three months six months one year five years five years bearing Total 2005 2005 2005 2005 2005 2005 2005 Assets m m m m m m m Treasury bills and other eligible bills 1 1 Loans and advances to banks 909 110 1,019 Debt securities held for treasury purposes 154 25 179 Debt securities and other fixed income securities held as financial fixed assets Loan investments 262 41 29 256 705 1,293 Fixed income shares 107 107 Equity shares 2,901 2,901 Other assets 201 201 1,325 176 29 256 706 3,209 5,701 Liabilities Deposits by banks 208 208 Debt securities in issue 142 37 27 349 892 1,089 Convertible bonds 378 378 Other liabilities 339 339 Subordinated liabilities 50 5 0 Shareholders funds 3,637 3,637 66 37 27 727 942 3,976 5,701 Interest rate sensitivity gap 1,259 213 2 471 236 767 Cumulative gap 1,259 1,472 1,474 1,003 767 More than More than More than three months six months one year but not but not but not Not more than more than more than more than More than Non-interest three months six months one year five years five years bearing Total 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 as restated as restated as restated as restated as restated as restated as restated Assets m m m m m m m Treasury bills and other eligible bills 1 1 Loans and advances to banks 419 65 50 534 Debt securities held for treasury purposes 244 40 284 Debt securities and other fixed income securities held as financial fixed assets Loan investments 424 39 59 301 489 1,312 Fixed income shares 150 150 Equity shares 2,864 2,864 Other assets 185 185 1,087 144 109 301 490 3,199 5,330 Liabilities Deposits by banks 215 215 Debt securities in issue 174 24 21 388 917 1,128 Convertible bonds 367 367 Other liabilities 345 345 Subordinated liabilities 45 4 5 Shareholders funds 3,230 3,230 41 24 21 755 962 3,575 5,330 Interest rate sensitivity gap 1,046 168 88 454 472 376 Cumulative gap 1,046 1,214 1,302 848 376 As restated to reflect the adoption of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits and UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts.
3i Report and accounts 2005 64 31 Currency exposures Currency rate risk emanates from the Groups international operations.
The policy regarding currency risk is set out in the Operating and financial review on pages 25 and 26.
Currency swaps are used as part of applying that policy.
The Groups structural currency exposures at 31 March 2005 were as follows: Variable Fixed Other Other net Short-term Other rate loan rate loan investment assets before variable rate variable rate Fixed rate investments investments assets borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings Net assets 2005 2005 2005 2005 2005 2005 2005 2005 Currency m m m m m m m m Sterling 198 478 1,360 852 717 215 1,196 2,624 Euro 75 291 930 115 448 93 583 473 US dollar 13 83 396 32 146 378 Swiss franc 50 93 2 41 104 Swedish krona 189 233 7 126 151 53 Other 15 48 1 53 6 5 Subtotal 89 528 1,700 157 814 58 589 1,013 Total 287 1,006 3,060 1,009 97 157 1,785 3,637 Variable Fixed Other Other net Short-term Other rate loan rate loan investment assets before variable rate variable rate Fixed rate investments investments assets borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings Net assets 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 as restated as restated as restated as restated as restated as restated as restated as restated Currency m m m m m m m m Sterling 341 429 1,622 556 60 223 1,132 2,099 Euro 102 256 862 28 72 60 595 785 US dollar 32 47 268 7 120 234 Swiss franc 41 68 3 21 91 Swedish krona 152 185 26 133 144 13 Other 11 41 7 12 13 34 Subtotal 135 407 1,424 71 214 84 608 1,131 Total 476 836 3,046 627 154 139 1,740 3,230 As restated to reflect the adoption of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits and UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts.
32 Liquidity The Groups liquidity policy is based on a maturity ladder approach with all mismatch limits of cash flows between cumulative assets and cumulative liabilities over various time periods approved by the Board.
The limits for shorter periods are also agreed with the Financial Services Authority.
33 Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities The Group does not have a trading book and it holds all assets and liabilities in a non-trading book.
Financial assets Quoted and unquoted equity investments and quoted fixed income shares are included in the consolidated balance sheet at market value or Directors valuation which equates to fair value.
Unquoted fixed income shares and loan investments are included in the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost or recoverable amount.
No liquid and active market exists, either for the unquoted fixed income shares or loan investments or their component parts.
The fair value of other financial assets equates to their book value in the consolidated balance sheet.
Financial liabilities The Groups borrowings finance loan investments, fixed income shares and equity shares.
As stated above, these unquoted loan and fixed income share investments are included in the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost or recoverable amount.
These investments are not shown at an estimated market value as no active and liquid market exists for them.
The Report and accounts therefore do not include any recognition of the effect of their yield being above or below current market yields.
However, Financial Reporting Standard 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures requires disclosure of the fair value of those elements of the Groups borrowings that are listed even though, in some cases, the market for those borrowings is not particularly active.
The remainder of the Groups borrowings, which are unlisted, do not have a liquid or active market.
The fair value of the listed element of financial liabilities at 31 March 2005 was 1,440 million 2004: 1,424 million, which compares with a book amount of 1,379 million 2004: 1,367 million.
These borrowings are used to fund investments which, in general, yield a net margin to the Group and which would therefore have a higher fair value than the fair value of the borrowing.
The fair value of other financial liabilities equates to their book value in the consolidated balance sheet.
Derivatives The Group does not trade in derivatives.
The derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
The book value of derivatives represents net interest receivable payable on such instruments at the balance sheet date.
The fair value represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
No unrealised gains or losses are included in the balance sheet.
The amount of unrecognised gains or losses at the balance sheet date equates to the difference between fair value and book value.
