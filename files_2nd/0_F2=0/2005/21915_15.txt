Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards.
The particular policies are described below: Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments and investment properties.
"The Statement of Recommended Practice ""SORP"" for Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies 2003 has been adopted, except in relation to accounting for Index Stock and the related interest as outlined below."
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings for the financial year ended 30 September 2005.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Investment income Dividend income is recognised in the revenue account when declared 'ex-dividend' as appropriate.
In accordance with FRS16, dividend income is now shown excluding any associated tax credit with a consequent reduction in the amount of the tax charges.
Income from fixed interest securities is dealt with on an accruals basis.
Enhanced scrip dividend income is accounted for by recognising the 'cash' element in the revenue account and the 'bonus' element in the capital reserve account.
Investments UK listed investments have been valued at middle-market quotations ruling at the close of business on 30 September 2005 and foreign listed investments have been valued at market prices and exchange rates at the same date.
Unlisted investments and investments in subsidiaries have been included at Directors' valuation.
Any profits or losses arising from the disposal of investments are taken directly to capital reserves.
Investments held by the dealing subsidiary undertakings are stated at the lower of cost and market value.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of settlement of the transaction.
Foreign currency balances, including investments denominated in foreign currencies, are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Profits or losses on retranslation of investments at the year end are included within unrealised appreciation depreciation of investments and are taken to capital reserves.
Expenses All expenses, including the base management fee of 0.30%, are charged on an accrual basis through the revenue account.
The remainder of the base management fee at the rate of 0.25% or 0.30% if the Company out-performs its benchmark index or under-performs by no more than 5% together with the performance element of the management fee are charged to capital.
The allocation of the management fee between revenue and capital is in line with the Boards expected long term split of returns between revenue and capital.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is measured without discounting on the basis of enacted tax rates.
Investment in subsidiary undertaking The Company's investment in its subsidiary is carried in the Company's accounts at net asset value attributable to its shareholding in the subsidiary undertaking.
qxp 12 11 05 8:15 am Page 34 British Empire Securities and General Trust plc Notes to the Accounts continued Capital reserves Capital reserves - realised The following are accounted for in this reserve: - gains and losses on the realisation of investments: - realised exchange differences of a capital nature: - the 'bonus' element of enhanced scrip dividends: - base management fee at the rate of 0.25% or 0.30% if the Company outperforms its benchmark index, or under - performs by no more than 5%: - the performance fee is charged wholly to capital reserve, since it derives from the capital performance of the Group relative to the benchmark index.
Capital reserves - unrealised The following are accounted for in this reserve: - increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end: - unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature: - increases and decreases in the valuation of the Index Stock.
Index Stock The Index Stock is valued at the capital value determined by reference to the level of the FTSE All-Share Index at the close of business on the relevant day.
Any difference between the nominal value and capital value is reflected through capital reserves.
Interest paid on the Index Stock is charged to revenue.
This does not comply with the Statement of Recommended Practice for Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies, which would require the finance costs of the Index Stock to be allocated between revenue and capital in line with the Board's expected long term split of returns and capital.
However, the Directors consider that the treatment adopted, which is consistent with previous years, is the most appropriate given the nature of the Index Stock.

Financial instruments The Groups financial instruments comprise equity and fixed interest investments, cash balances and borrowings.
As an investment trust the Group holds a portfolio of financial assets in pursuit of its investment objective.
The Group makes use of borrowings to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The risk of borrowings may be reduced by raising the level of cash balances or fixed interest investments held.
Investments held see note 8 are valued at middle market prices which equate to their fair values.
The market value of the Groups Debenture Stocks is disclosed in note 14.
The fair value of all other financial assets and liabilities is represented by their carrying value in the Balance Sheet.
Short term debtors and creditors are excluded from disclosure as allowed by FRS 13, other than for currency disclosures.
Market price risk The management of market price risk is part of the fund management process and is typical of equity investment.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse price movements through detailed and continuing analysis with the objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out on pages 18 to 20.
The Group has not used derivatives to date as part of its investment strategy but reserves the right to do so in the future.
