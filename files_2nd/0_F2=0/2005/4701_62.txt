32 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles Diageo plc is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and the groups consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP applicable in the United Kingdom.
UK GAAP differs in certain significant respects from US GAAP.
The differences between UK and US GAAP, in respect of net income and shareholders equity, are set out below: Effect on net income of differences between UK and US GAAP: 2005 2004 2003 Notes million million million Net income in accordance with UK GAAP 1,375 1,392 50 Adjustments to conform with US GAAP: Goodwill and other intangibles a 1 5 7 Inventories b 24 37 46 Restructuring and integration costs c 16 Pensions and other post employment benets d 5 10 95 Derivative instruments in respect of General Mills shares e 27 28 4 Other derivative instruments f 53 111 189 Disposal of businesses g 5 69 177 Disposal of General Mills shares g 87 Burger King h 17 13 693 Employee share options k 5 5 11 Other items 27 75 Deferred taxation on above adjustments 31 21 52 other m 21 164 65 Net income in accordance with US GAAP 1,470 1,700 434 Earnings per ordinary share in accordance with US GAAP n Basic earnings per ordinary share 49.5p 56.1p 13.9p Diluted earnings per ordinary share 49.4p 56.1p 13.9p Basic earnings per ADS 198.0p 224.4p 55.6p Diluted earnings per ADS 197.6p 224.4p 55.6p Diageo Annual Report 2005 13 1 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued Cumulative effect on shareholders equity of differences between UK and US GAAP: 30 June 30 June 2005 2004 Notes million million Shareholders equity in accordance with UK GAAP 3,641 3,692 Adjustments to conform with US GAAP: Brands a, b 3,048 3,052 Goodwill a, b 3,541 3,503 Other intangibles a, b 26 32 Inventories b 93 141 Pensions and other post employment benets d 440 539 Derivative instruments in respect of General Mills shares e 45 22 Other derivative instruments f 46 28 Investment in General Mills i 148 476 Revaluation of land and buildings j 33 34 Ordinary dividends l 530 513 Other items 5 6 Deferred taxation on above adjustments 149 340 other m 1,436 1,275 Shareholders equity in accordance with US GAAP 9,853 10,287 A description of accounting differences between UK and US GAAP that are material to the group is set out below.
a Brands, goodwill and other intangibles significant owned brands acquired by the group are recorded on the balance sheet.
Under UK GAAP, the group has written off other intangible assets acquired up to 30 June 1998 direct to reserves in the period when acquired.
All intangible assets acquired from 1 July 1998 have been capitalised in the balance sheet.
Where capitalised goodwill and intangible assets are regarded as having limited useful economic lives, their cost is amortised on a straight line basis over those lives up to 20 years.
Where intangible assets are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives, they are not amortised but are subject to annual impairment reviews.
Under US GAAP, up to 30 June 2001, intangible assets have been capitalised in the balance sheet and amortised through the statement of income over their useful economic lives, not exceeding 40 years.
On 1 July 2001, the group adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and ceased to amortise goodwill from this date.
The standard requires that intangible assets arising on acquisitions with definite useful lives, are amortised to their estimable residual values over their estimated useful lives.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually in lieu of being amortised.
Goodwill arising on business combinations is tested for impairment at least annually in lieu of amortisation.
b Accounting for the merger of GrandMet and the Guinness Group For UK GAAP, the merger of GrandMet and the Guinness Group was accounted for under merger accounting principles pooling of interests where the results, cash ows and balance sheets of both entities, having made adjustments to achieve uniformity of accounting policies, were aggregated with no adjustment to fair value.
Under US GAAP, the merger was accounted for as an acquisition of the Guinness Group by GrandMet with an effective acquisition date of 31 December 1997.
Consequently the Guinness Group assets and liabilities were recorded at fair values on 31 December 1997.
Under US GAAP, the excess of the consideration over the fair value of the net assets has been allocated rstly to identiable intangible assets, including brands, based on their fair values with the remainder allocated to goodwill.
Fair value adjustments to the recorded amounts of inventories, net of deferred tax, are expensed in the period in which the inventory is sold.
c Restructuring and integration costs On the acquisition of a business, certain costs of reorganising the acquired business are required to be taken to the profit and loss account under UK GAAP, but are treated as fair value adjustments to goodwill under US GAAP.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 13 2 Notes to the consolidated financial statements d Pensions and other post employment benefits Under UK GAAP, the pension cost for the period is based on an actuarial valuation at the start of the financial period.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
The interest cost being the unwinding of the discount on the funds liabilities for the period and the expected return on assets for the period calculated using the market value of assets are charged credited to other finance charges in the profit and loss account.
Any amount arising from changes in the assumptions used for the actuarial valuation at the commencement of the year and those at the end of the year and any differences between the actual return on the plans assets and the expected return on the plans assets are included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The surplus or deficit in post employment plans at the balance sheet date is reported as part of the groups consolidated net assets.
Under US GAAP, the pension cost for the period is based on an actuarial valuation at the start of the financial period.
The current service cost, the interest being the unwinding of the discount on the funds liabilities for the period and the expected return on assets for the period calculated using a smoothed market value of assets are all charged credited to operating profit.
The cumulative amounts arising from changes in the assumptions used for the actuarial valuation at the commencement of the year and those at the end of the year and any differences between the actual return on the plans assets and the expected return on the plans assets are amortised through operating profit over the average remaining service lives of the employees.
Only when the plan is in deficit, calculated on the plans accrued rather than projected liabilities, is the liability included in the groups consolidated net assets.
If the plan is in surplus, the groups consolidated net assets include a prepayment or provision which is the difference between the cumulative charges to operating profit and the cumulative cash contributions made to the plan.
e Derivative instruments in respect of General Mills shares Under UK GAAP, the premium received from the sale to General Mills of options over 29 million ordinary shares of Diageos holding in that company was deferred in the balance sheet pending exercise or lapse of the options.
On 4 October 2004, 4 million of the shares over which the option was exercisable were disposed of to the groups UK pension fund.
The premium in respect of the option over the 4 million shares has been realised in the profit and loss account under UK GAAP in the year ended 30 June 2005.
Also under UK GAAP, the contingent value right, received in connection with the disposal of Pillsbury, was treated as a contingent asset and was therefore not recognised until the realisation of the contingent asset became virtually certain.
The group received cash in settlement of the contingent value right on 1 May 2003, and as a consequence it was accounted for in the consolidated profit and loss account in the year ended 30 June 2003.
Under US GAAP, the option contract and the contingent value right represent derivatives and, accordingly, have been held at their estimated fair values at the balance sheet dates with changes in fair value included in the statement of income.
f Other derivative instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes.
Under UK GAAP, changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives and derivatives hedging forecast transactions are not recognised until realised.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives hedging the translation of net assets of overseas operations are taken to the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under US GAAP, all derivatives are carried at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Certain of the groups derivatives qualify for and are designated as hedges under US GAAP.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives, and gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, are charged or credited in determining net income under US GAAP.
g Disposal of businesses Applying the accounting differences between UK and US GAAP can result in changes to the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities.
As a consequence of these different carrying values, including related tax balances, different gains or losses may arise on the subsequent disposal of the assets.
In addition, the timing of the recognition of a loss on a disposal may be different under UK and US GAAP.
On the disposal of a business under UK GAAP, the cumulative exchange gains and losses arising on the unhedged net assets of the business disposed of remain in reserves.
Under US GAAP, this amount is charged or credited to net income on the disposal of all or part of the business.
Under UK GAAP, in the year ended 30 June 2005, the group made a pre-tax loss of 26 million on the disposal of 53.9 million General Mills shares.
Under US GAAP, the group made a pre-tax gain of 61 million in respect of the disposal of these shares.
The main reason for the difference was the different carrying values under UK and US GAAP of the General Mills investment, which principally arose from the varying historical accounting treatments for intangible assets.
Under US GAAP, until 30 June 2001, the goodwill and brands in respect of the General Mills investment were being amortised over 40 years, whereas no amortisation on these assets had been charged under UK GAAP.
In addition, interest rate swaps were closed out at a cost of 25 million and charged to the loss on disposal under UK GAAP but, under US GAAP, these instruments had been carried at fair value with gains and losses arising being accounted for through the statement of income prior to the sale.
Partially offsetting these differences, cumulative unhedged currency translation losses of 37 million were included in the gain on disposal under US GAAP.
Under UK GAAP, cumulative currency translation gains and losses are not included in the loss on disposal.
In connection with the disposal of Pillsbury in the year ended 30 June 2002, Diageo guaranteed the debt of International Multifoods Corporation IMC to the amount of $200 million 112 million.
Under US GAAP, Diageo had deferred the element of the gain on disposal of Pillsbury equivalent to the amount guaranteed.
As a result of the acquisition of IMC by The JM Smucker Company in the year ended 30 June 2004, the deferred gain under US GAAP was recognised in that year.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 133 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued h Burger King Under UK GAAP, the sale of Burger King on 13 December 2002 the completion date was accounted for as a disposal and the results prior to the disposal date were presented within discontinued operations.
Under US GAAP, the transaction was not accounted for as a disposal due to the size of the investment made by the buyer and Diageos continuing involvement through the guarantee provided by Diageo in respect of the acquisition finance.
Under US GAAP, the results of Burger King prior to the completion date were presented as continuing operations in the income statement and, on the completion date, a charge for impairment was recognised rather than a loss on disposal.
Following the completion date, Diageo does not recognise profits of Burger King, nor interest receivable on the subordinated debt due from Burger King, in its income statement but will, generally, reect losses as an impairment charge against the assets retained in the balance sheet.
In the US GAAP balance sheet, the total assets and total liabilities of Burger King at 30 June 2005 including consideration deferred under US GAAP classied within other long term assets and other long term liabilities were each 1.2 billion 2004 1.2 billion.
Under US GAAP, the transaction will be accounted for as a disposal in the year ending 30 June 2006 following the termination of the guarantee provided in respect of the acquisition finance and repayment of the subordinated debt owed to Diageo on 13 July 2005. i Investment in General Mills On 23 June 2004, Diageo and General Mills amended the Stockholders Agreement to eliminate Diageos right to board representation, following the resignation of Diageos representatives on the General Mills board.
From that date, Diageo believes that it no longer has significant inuence over General Mills and accordingly the investment was reclassied as a xed asset investment under UK GAAP and as an available for sale security under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP, available for sale securities are held on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value included in other comprehensive income.
On the disposal of part of the investment in General Mills on 4 October 2004, the amount included in other comprehensive income in reserves in respect of the shares disposed of has been included in net income.
j Revaluation of land and buildings UK GAAP allows the periodic revaluation of land and buildings.
Professional valuations of certain of the groups properties were carried out in 1988 which, under US GAAP, have not been reected in the consolidated financial statements.
k Employee share options Under UK GAAP, for employee share options, compensation cost charged to the profit and loss account is determined as the difference between the fair value of the shares at the date of the award and the amount the employee has to pay for the shares.
Compensation cost so determined is allocated on a straight line basis to expense over the vesting period.
Under US GAAP, compensation cost for xed awards i. e. awards under which both the exercise price and the number of shares are xed is the same as under UK GAAP.
Compensation cost for variable awards including awards subject to future performance conditions is measured as the difference between the market price at the period end and the exercise price and is based on the number of awards expected to vest.
l Ordinary dividends Under UK GAAP, the proposed dividends on ordinary shares, as recommended by the directors, are deducted from shareholders equity and shown as a liability in the balance sheet at the end of the period to which they relate.
Under US GAAP, such dividends are only deducted from shareholders equity at the date of declaration of the dividend.
m Deferred taxation UK GAAP requires, in most cases, that no provision for deferred tax should be made on the combination of businesses where an asset or liability acquired has a different tax basis from its carrying value.
US GAAP requires a deferred tax liability to be set up on all assets separately identied, apart from goodwill, including brands recognised on the combination of GrandMet and the Guinness Group.
In addition, under US GAAP, adjustments due to changes in the assumptions underlying the recoverability of deferred tax assets associated with items that may have been recognised in the other comprehensive income statement are recognised in net income.
Under UK GAAP, equivalent movements may be reected in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Other minor differences exist including differences related to rolled over gains on the disposal of xed assets.
n Earnings per ordinary share Under UK GAAP and US GAAP, the calculation of earnings per ordinary share is generally consistent and is based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Earnings per American Depositary Share are calculated on the basis of one American Depositary Share representing four ordinary shares.
o Discontinued operations UK and US GAAP have different criteria for determining whether a business is a discontinued operation.
Under UK GAAP, the turnover and operating profit of a discontinued operation are disclosed separately in the profit and loss account but as part of turnover and operating profit.
Under US GAAP, sales and net income arising from discontinued operations are disclosed separately from sales and net income from continuing operations.
Pillsbury and Burger King have been treated as discontinued operations under UK GAAP but included within continuing operations under US GAAP.
p Variable interest entities Following the implementation of FIN 46 R by Diageo on 30 June 2004, US GAAP requires the results, assets and liabilities of variable interest entities to be consolidated if the group is regarded as the primary beneciary.
The group has a number of joint arrangements with Met Hennessy in France and the Far East involved in the marketing and distribution of the groups and Met Hennessys premium drinks which fall within the scope of the Interpretation and have been consolidated.
Under UK GAAP, the group only consolidates the attributable share of the results, assets and liabilities of the joint arrangements measured according to the terms of the arrangement.
For the year ended 30 June 2005, the consolidation of variable interest entities under US GAAP increased sales by 303 million and operating income by 25 million.
Compliance with FIN 46 R had no effect on US GAAP net income or shareholders equity.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 134 Notes to the consolidated financial statements US GAAP statements of income Statements of income under US GAAP for the three years ended 30 June 2005 are set out below: 2005 2004 2003 million million million Sales 9,170 8,777 9,153 Excise duties 2,272 2,209 2,166 Net sales 6,898 6,568 6,987 Other cost of sales 2,834 2,860 2,896 Gross profit 4,064 3,708 4,091 Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,235 1,793 2,235 Integration and restructuring costs 30 40 202 Thalidomide provision 121 Bass distribution rights 57 Derivative instruments in respect of General Mills shares 27 28 4 Burger King impairment charges and transaction costs net 53 38 750 Disposal of businesses 2 97 16 Disposal of xed assets 7 38 40 Other operating income 5 422 Operating income 1,768 1,928 955 Disposal of General Mills shares 61 Earnings from unconsolidated afliates net of income taxes 150 252 254 Investment income 17 Interest expense 205 210 609 Interest income 60 40 286 Income before income taxes 1,851 2,010 886 Income taxes 313 220 360 Minority interest charges 68 90 92 Net income 1,470 1,700 434 The results of Burger King prior to 13 December 2002 were presented as part of continuing operations in the income statement.
Subsequently, due to the size of the investment made by the buyer and Diageos continuing involvement through the guarantee provided by Diageo, no profits of Burger King have been recognised but only losses as an impairment charge against the assets retained in the balance sheet.
Sales and operating income, excluding the impairment charge and transaction costs, recognised in respect of Burger King in the income statement for the year ended 30 June 2003 amounted to 479 million and 38 million, respectively.
Research and development expenditure was written off to selling, general and administrative expenses in the period in which it was incurred.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 135 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued Movements in US GAAP shareholders equity 2005 2004 million million Shareholders equity in accordance with US GAAP at beginning of the year 10,287 9,344 Net income 1,470 1,700 Minimum pension liabilities 361 325 Deferred tax on minimum pension liabilities 33 5 Dividends 849 802 New share capital issued 6 4 Net change in employee share trust arrangements 11 17 Repurchase of own shares 710 306 Losses gains on available for sale securities 197 270 Exchange adjustments 185 226 Shareholders equity in accordance with US GAAP at end of the year 9,853 10,287 Under US GAAP, cumulative exchange adjustments charged against retained surplus are separately identied.
This does not result in any difference in total shareholders equity between UK and US GAAP.

The objective and principles of FRS 1 are similar to those set out in the US accounting standard SFAS No.
The principal difference between the standards is in respect of classication.
Under FRS 1, the group presents its cash ows separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investment, acquisitions and disposals, equity dividends paid, management of liquid resources and nancing.
95 requires only three categories of cash ow activity being operating, investing and nancing.
Cash ows arising from taxation and returns on investments and servicing of finance under FRS 1 would be included as operating activities.
95, capital expenditure and financial investment would be included as an investing activity, and equity dividends paid would be classied as a nancing activity.
In addition, cash for the purposes of the cash ow statement under FRS 1 includes bank overdrafts but excludes liquid resources current asset investments held as readily available disposable stores of value.
Under US GAAP, bank overdrafts are classied as borrowings and the movements thereon are included in nancing activities.
Liquid resources, with a maturity of three months or less at the date acquired, are considered to be cash equivalents and the movements thereon are included in the overall cash movement under US GAAP.

Comprehensive income, under US GAAP, for the three years ended 30 June 2005 is as follows: Year ended 30 June 2005 Year ended 30 June 2004 Before tax Tax Net Before tax Tax Net million million million million million million Net income 1,783 313 1,470 1,920 220 1,700 Exchange adjustments unrealised gains losses arising during the year 148 148 226 226 realised losses reclassied to net income 37 37 Holding gains on available for sale securities unrealised losses gains arising during the year 80 80 270 270 realised gains reclassied to net income 117 117 Minimum pension liabilities 361 33 328 325 5 320 Comprehensive income 1,410 280 1,130 2,289 225 2,064 Year ended 30 June 2003 Before tax Tax Net million million million Net income 794 360 434 Exchange adjustments unrealised gains arising during the year 7 7 Minimum pension liabilities 770 34 736 Comprehensive income deficit 31 326 295 Diageo Annual Report 2005 137 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued US GAAP intangible assets Under US GAAP, up to 30 June 2001, intangible assets were capitalised in the balance sheet and amortised through the statement of income over their useful economic lives, not exceeding 40 years.
142 and ceased to amortise goodwill from this date.
The standard directs that goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment rather than being subject to amortisation.
The group conducts annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the level of the reporting units which make up each operating segment.
Potential impairment is assessed by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit with its fair value.
Fair value is calculated using a discounted cash ow methodology and estimates regarding future growth.
These cash ows are discounted at the rate estimated by management to be the weighted average cost of capital for each particular reporting unit.
The estimates are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of the long term planning process.
An analysis of movements in intangible assets for the two years ended 30 June 2005 is as follows: Other Brands Goodwill intangibles Total million million million million Cost At 30 June 2003 7,901 3,646 168 11,715 Exchange adjustments 269 60 3 332 Additions 123 Adjustment to tax in respect of acquisitions 47 47 Disposals 8 8 At 30 June 2004 7,632 3,532 167 11,331 Exchange adjustments 100 14 2 116 Additions 97 97 194 Adjustment to tax in respect of acquisitions 29 29 At 30 June 2005 7,829 3,614 169 11,612 Amortisation At 30 June 2003 621 373 83 1,077 Exchange adjustments 19 4 1 24 Provided during the year 12 12 Disposals 1 1 At 30 June 2004 602 368 94 1,064 Exchange adjustments 41 5 Provided during the year 11 11 At 30 June 2005 606 369 105 1,080 Net book value At 30 June 2005 7,223 3,245 64 10,532 At 30 June 2004 7,030 3,164 73 10,267 At 30 June 2003 7,280 3,273 85 10,638 The differences in the shareholders equity reconciliation between UK and US GAAP for brands, goodwill and other intangibles are attributable to historical cost differences of 3,687 million, 3,525 million and 107 million, respectively 2004 3,687 million, 3,497 million and 106 million, respectively, less differences on accumulated amortisation of 606 million, 352 million and 81 million, respectively 2004 602 million, 359 million and 74 million, respectively.
In addition, differences in relation to share of associates brands and goodwill are attributable to historical cost differences of nil and 406 million, respectively 2004 nil and 403 million, respectively, less differences on accumulated amortisation of 33 million and 38 million, respectively 2004 33 million and 38 million, respectively.
In segmental information, brands are reported, under UK GAAP, within Corporate and other.
Goodwill at 30 June 2005 was attributable to operating segments as follows: North America 959 million, Europe 973 million, and International 1,313 million.
Additions to goodwill in the year ended 30 June 2005 by operating segment were as follows: North America 26 million, Europe 66 million and International 5 million.
The estimated amortisation expense for the other intangibles currently in the balance sheet for the succeeding five years ending 30 June is as follows: 2006 11 million, 2007 10 million, 2008 7 million, 2009 5 million, and 2010 4 million.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 138 Notes to the consolidated financial statements New accounting standards and pronouncements in the United States SFAS No.
151 Inventory Costs In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
151 Inventory Costs to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognised as current period charges.
151 requires that the allocation of xed production overheads to inventory values be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.
151 is effective for costs incurred in respect of inventories for reporting periods beginning after 15 June 2005.
151 is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the group.
153 Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No.
29 In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.
153 which, for periods beginning after 15 June 2005, no longer allows the exemption included in APB Opinion No.
29 APB 29 which permitted certain non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets to be accounted for at book value with no gain or loss being recognised.
153 such non-monetary transactions have to be accounted for at fair value, recognising any gain or loss, if the transaction meets a commercial substance criterion and the fair value is determinable.
153 did not affect the guidance in APB 29 for non-monetary exchanges of inventory.
153 is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the group.
123 R Share-Based Payment In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.
123 R Share-Based Payment which is a revision of SFAS No.
123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No.
25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Generally the valuation methods contained in SFAS No.
123 R are similar to those in SFAS No.
123 R requires all sharebased payments to employees, including grants of employee share options, to be charged to the statement of income.
Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.
With limited exceptions, the amount charged to the statement of income for share options will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the option amortised over the period to the date of vesting of the award.
123 R is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after 15 June 2005.
123 R is likely to increase the annual US GAAP charge to income before taxation by approximately 10 million, based on the current structure of the awards.
154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No.
154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which is effective for periods beginning after 15 December 2005.
This statement replaces APB Opinion No.
20 Accounting Changes APB 20 and SFAS No.
3 Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.
APB 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognised by including, in net income of the period of the change, the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle.
154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specic effects or the cumulative effect of the change.
154 is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the group.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 139 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued Share option schemes Under US GAAP, the group has complied with APB Opinion No.
The group has also complied with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No.
123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation as amended by SFAS No.
If the group had elected to recognise compensation expense based upon the fair value at grant date for equity awards made in the three years ended 30 June 2005 under these plans consistent with the alternative methodology set out in SFAS No.

Changes in assumptions could affect the estimates.
Pro forma net income for the years ended 30 June 2004 and 2003 has been adjusted to reect corrections to the fair values of all options relevant to the profit and loss charge under SFAS No.
The adjustments have increased pro forma net income compared with the amounts previously reported by 13 million and 8 million for the years ended 30 June 2004 and 30 June 2003, respectively.
Pro forma earnings per share for those years and the disclosure of the fair value of all options granted in those years have been adjusted to reect these corrections.
Fair value of options The fair value of options which, in determining the pro forma impact, is charged to the statement of income over the option vesting period, is estimated on the date of grant using the binomial and Monte Carlo option pricing models and the following weighted average assumptions: 2005 2004 2003 Options whose exercise price equals the market price on the grant date DSOP, DACSOP and SESOP Weighted average assumptions Risk free interest rate 4.6% 4.9% 4.7% Expected life of the options 60 months 60 months 60 months Expected volatility 30% 30% 30% Dividend yield 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% Weighted average fair value of options granted in the year 165p 156p 174p Options whose exercise price is less than the market price on the grant date SRSOS, USESPP and International Weighted average assumptions Risk free interest rate 4.7% 4.1% 4.2% Expected life of the options 40 months 41 months 38 months Expected volatility 30% 30% 30% Dividend yield 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% Weighted average fair value of options granted in the year 214p 221p 191p Number of options granted in the year 13.6 million 15.4 million 15.3 million Fair value of all options granted in the year 24 million 26 million 27 million In the table above, an option over one ADS has been treated as the equivalent of one option over four ordinary shares.

The plans generally are of the dened benefit type.
The significant plans are in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States and Canada.
The principal plans are funded by payments to separately administered funds or insurance companies.
The measurement dates used to calculate the gures in the US GAAP financial information are the appropriate balance sheet dates.

There are a number of pension plans in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States and Canada where the plan assets are less than the accumulated benefit obligations at 30 June 2005.
With respect to these plans, the aggregated projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets were 5,180 million, 4,781 million and 3,984 million, respectively 2004 3,654 million, 3,466 million and 2,744 million, respectively.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 142 Notes to the consolidated financial statements The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the groups benefit obligations for the groups pension plans at 30 June in the relevant year.
The assumptions used to calculate the net periodic costs for the year to 30 June are based on the assumptions disclosed as at the previous 30 June: US plans Non-US plans 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 % %% % %% Rate of general increase in salaries 3.0 3.5 3.5 3.9 4.4 4.0 Discount rate for plan liabilities 5.0 6.2 5.9 4.7 5.6 5.2 Expected long term rate of return on plan assets 6.5 7.5 6.7 6.9 7.7 7.1 For the UK and US plans, there are, in addition to the above percentages, age related promotional increases.
Contributions are made by the group, on actuarial advice, to provide assets sufficient to cover the benefit entitlements of plan participants.
Generally, benets are based on a formula recognising length of service and earnings close to retirement.
Postretirement benefits other than pensions The group also operates a number of plans, primarily in the United States, which provide employees with postretirement insurance.
The plans are generally unfunded.
The liability in respect of these benets is assessed by qualied independent actuaries under the projected unit method and is included in other long term liabilities.
The postretirement medical and life insurance costs for the plans, calculated in accordance with SFAS No.
106, were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 million million million Service cost 1 2 1 Interest cost 4 4 6 Expected return on assets 2 Terminations, curtailments and settlements 4 Postretirement charge 5 6 1 2005 2004 million million Accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at beginning of the year 66 78 Exchange adjustments 2 7 Other plans not previously disclosed 5 Service cost 1 2 Interest cost 4 4 Actuarial loss gain 19 9 Benets and expenses paid 4 2 Accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at end of the year 93 66 Plan assets at fair value at beginning of the year 2 2 Contributions by the group 4 2 Benets and expenses paid 4 2 Plan assets at fair value at end of the year 2 2 Excess of benefit obligations over plan assets 91 64 Unrecognised prior service cost 3 3 Unrecognised net loss 22 2 Accrued postretirement benets at end of the year 66 59 The weighted average discount rate used for determining the obligations of postretirement medical plans is 5.0% 2004 6.2%: 2003 5.9%.
The weighted average medical ination for beneciaries is 10% reducing by 1% per year to 5% 2004 8% reducing by 1% per year to 5%: 2003 9% reducing by 1% per year to 5%.
