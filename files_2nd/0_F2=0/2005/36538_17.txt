NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS A.
PROFIT FOR THE YEAR As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the income statement of the Company is not presented as part of these financial statements.
The pro t for the year attributable to equity shareholders dealt with in the financial statements of the Company was 201.8 million 2004: 107.5 million, restated see note B.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Although the group consolidated accounts are prepared under IFRS, the Hammerson plc company accounts presented in this section are prepared under UK GAAP.
Following the issue of several UK accounting standards intended to converge certain aspects of UK GAAP with IFRS, the accounting policies relevant to the Company are included within those set out in the group accounting policies in note 1, principally those for foreign currency, borrowings, interest and derivatives.
The new UK accounting standards are: FRS 21: Events after the balance sheet date FRS 23: The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates FRS 25: Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation FRS 26: Financial instruments: measurement The effect of FRS 21 on the comparative gures is to exclude the 2004 proposed final dividend from the balance sheet and income statement.
Consequently, in respect of the year ended 31 December 2004, retained earnings and equity shareholders funds are increased by 34.5 million.
FRS 23 and FRS 26 do not require the restatement of comparative periods.
The impact of FRS 26 is to recognise the fair value of interest rate swaps at 1 January 2005.
Further details on this adjustment are given in note 27 of the consolidated financial statements.

In 2005, the Company clari ed its accounting policy in respect of this reserve, such that it now includes its investment in own shares at cost.
The effects on the Company, at 31 December 2004, are that investment in own shares and amounts owed to subsidiaries have increased by 0.9 million and equity shareholders funds have decreased by the same amount.
The Company has no employees.
When the Companys own shares are awarded to group employees as part of their remuneration, the cost of the shares is transferred by the Company through the inter-company account, to the employing subsidiary company, Hammerson Group Management Limited HGM and shown as a debit in the other reserves of HGM.
The expense related to share-based employee remuneration is calculated in accordance with FRS 20 and the terms of the Plan, and recognised in the income statement of HGM within administration expenses.
The corresponding credit is included in HGMs other reserves.
The difference between the cost and the carrying value as previously reported, being the credit entry in respect of the FRS 20 charge for share awards under the ESOP, has been recorded in HGM within retained earnings.
Further details of the number of shares held by the Company are set out in note 23.
