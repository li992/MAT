Earnings per share The calculation of the earnings per share is based on 305.1m 2004: 320.9m ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue and ranking for dividend during the year.

Figures calculated on this basis have been provided to show the effect of excluding the increase in fair value of investment properties and exceptional items, together with attributable taxation.

Description of plans The group participates in a number of pension schemes, principally in the UK.
The major scheme is a funded fide ned bene ts scheme The Associated British Ports Group Pension Scheme.
The fide ned bene t section of this scheme was closed to new members with effect from 6 April 2002.
New members joining this scheme from 6 April 2002 are offered membership of a fide ned contributions section which at 31 December 2005 constituted less than 1.0 per cent of the total asset value.
The group also provides fide ned contribution arrangements, makes contributions to three industry-wide fide ned bene t schemes and has unfunded retirement bene t arrangements in respect of former employees.
Except for unfunded retirement bene t arrangements, the assets of the groups pension schemes are held in trust funds independent of its nances.

The valuation of the liabilities detailed below has been derived by projecting forward the position as at 31 December 2003.
It was performed by an independent actuary, Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow.
The present value of the fide ned bene t obligations and the related current service cost were measured using the Projected Unit Credit method.
In accordance with IAS 19, the present value of pension liabilities has been determined by discounting pension commitments including an allowance for salary growth using a AA corporate bond yield.
The liability associated with the unfunded retirement bene t arrangement has also been determined by the actuary, Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow, using the same assumptions as those used to calculate the Associated British Ports Group Pension Scheme liabilities.

Pension commitments continued C. fide ned bene ts scheme and unfunded retirement bene t arrangements continued i Assumptions The major financial assumptions used by the actuary as at 31 December were as follows: Assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out.
2005 2004 % % In ation 2.75 2.75 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.25 4.25 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.75 2.75 Rate of increase for deferred pensions 2.75 2.75 Discount rate 4.70 5.30 Expected return on plan assets 6.10 6.20 The mortality assumption used in determining the groups expected pension liabilities is based on the standard actuarial tables PA 92, projected forwards to 2025 with the Short Cohort adjustment applied.
Based on these tables, life expectancies from age 65 are estimated as being 20.1 years for males and 22.7 years for females.
Mortality rates applied have been increased by 25 per cent to re ect the nature of the schemes membership and its past experience.
Expected return on assets is a blended average of projected long-term returns for the various asset classes.
ii Operating pro t The amounts recognised in the income statement during the year were as follows: 2005 2004 m m Current service cost 8.1 6.4 Expected return on plan assets 25.9 25.4 Interest cost on plan liabilities 20.4 19.9 Interest cost on unfunded retirement bene t liabilities 0.2 0.2 Net pension charge recognised within operating pro t 2.8 1.1 The current service cost of 8.1m 2004: 6.4m represented 26.8% 2004: 19.8% of the applicable pensionable payroll.
The increase in current service cost was partly attributable to the implementation of a salary-sacri ce plan, under which the scheme members agreed to a salary reduction in return for the group agreeing to make contributions to the scheme that were previously made by the members.
The group recognised 2.1m 2004: 0.9m of its net pension charge for 2005 within cost of sales and 0.7m 2004: 0.2m within administrative expenses.
The group made total contributions of 1.4m 2004: 0.3m towards funded and unfunded schemes.
The increase in contribution levels resulted from the implementation of the salary-sacri ce plan and the group expects its level of contribution into the scheme to be similar during 2006.
Returns on assets and interest on liabilities are determined by reference to the actuarial assumptions adopted at the beginning of each financial year.
The actual return on assets for 2005 was 67.0m 2004: 28.7m.

The 2005 actuarial loss of 25.1m arose as the better than expected return on assets of 41.1m was more than offset by increased liabilities associated with the adoption of updated mortality tables 24.7m and with the 60 basis point decrease in the discount rate applied to liabilities 41.5m.

At 31 December 2005, there were no amounts outstanding as being due to these arrangements from the group 2004: nil.
E. Industry-wide schemes i The Pilots National Pension Fund PNPF The PNPF is an industry-wide fide ned bene ts scheme.
As at 31 December 2004, the date of the most recent full triennial valuation carried out by an independent actuary, the scheme had assets with a market value of 339m, representing 76 per cent of the bene ts accruing to members after allowing for future increases.
As at that date, the funding level continued to exceed the minimum funding requirements.
The scheme actuary has estimated the IAS 19 fide cit as at 31 December 2005 as being 107m.
Approximately 42 per cent of the schemes assets were invested in equities, 44 per cent in bonds, 11 per cent in hedge funds and 3 per cent in cash.
The IAS 19 valuation assumptions adopted by the actuary were as follows: % In ation 2.75 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.75 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.75 Rate of increase for deferred pensions 2.75 Discount rate 4.70 Expected return on plan assets 8.00 Prior year previously reported under UK GAAP, now reported under IFRS note 33 74 0 06-1014 ABP Accounts FINAL.
Pension commitments continued E. Industry-wide schemes continued i The Pilots National Pension Fund PNPF continued Following the 31 December 2004 valuation, the trustees of this scheme are in negotiations with the participating bodies to agree a schedule of contributions to reduce the fide cit.
The scheme rules do not provide a mechanism for the allocation of past-service fide cits.
A number of different legal opinions have been issued concerning this scheme and the group is unable to determine its share of the pastservice fide cit on a reasonable basis.
The potential IAS 19 pre-tax liability that could arise in relation to the past-service fide cit for this scheme could range from 1.1m to 31.1m as at 31 December 2005.
During 2005, the group made contributions of 95,000 to this scheme in relation to its current active members and has recorded those as fide ned contribution costs within the income statement.
In the absence of an agreement on the allocation of the past-service fide cit, the group is unable to determine its share of assets and liabilities for this scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore continues to account for this scheme as a fide ned contribution scheme.
ii The Former Registered Dock Workers Pension Fund FRDWPF The FRDWPF is an industry-wide fide ned bene ts scheme.
As at 5 April 2002, the date of the most recent full triennial valuation carried out by an independent actuary, the scheme had assets with a market value of 804m, representing 107 per cent of the bene ts accruing to members after allowing for future increases.
As at that date, the funding level remained suf cient to exceed the minimum funding requirements and management believes that this scheme remained in surplus on an IAS 19 basis as at 31 December 2005.
The group does not have access to more recent scheme data.
As at 5 April 2002, approximately 23 per cent of the schemes assets were invested in equities, 76 per cent in bonds and 1 per cent in property and cash.
The valuation assumptions adopted by the actuary at the time of the last valuation were as follows: % In ation 2.80 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.80 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.60 Rate of increase for deferred pensions 3.60 Discount rate 5.10 Expected return on plan assets 5.10 During 2005, the group made contributions of 56,000 to this scheme in relation to its current active members and has recorded those as fide ned contribution costs within the income statement.
The scheme rules for the FRDWPF do not provide for the allocation of assets and liabilities to the participating employers and therefore the group accounts for this scheme as a fide ned contribution scheme.
iii Merchant Navy Of cers Pension Fund MNOPF The MNOPF is an industry-wide fide ned bene ts scheme.
The scheme is divided into two sections, the Old Section and the New Section, both of which are closed to new members.
The latest valuation for each section was carried out on 31 December 2003.
As at 31 December 2003, the Old Section had assets of 1,316m, representing 115 per cent of the bene ts accrued to members, whilst the New Section had assets of 1,768m, representing 86 per cent of the bene ts accrued to members as at that date.
Following this valuation, the trustees undertook court proceedings to determine the allocation of the past-service fide cit for the New Section.
In 2005, the court established which employers were liable for the past-service fide cit and the trustees adopted an allocation consistent with the court ruling.
The groups share of the past-service fide cit was con rmed as being 169,000.
The group settled and expensed this amount as a fide ned contribution pension cost in its income statement in 2005.
In addition, the group paid and expensed 11,000 of regular contributions to this scheme as fide ned contribution pension costs.
Given the groups immaterial exposure, the lack of availability of data and the in uence the group enjoys over the affairs of this scheme, the group intends to continue to account for this scheme as a fide ned contribution scheme.

Onerous contracts The provision for onerous contracts represents amounts provided in relation to property leases, which the group is committed to until 2016, where the unavoidable costs under the lease exceed the economic bene t. In determining the provision, cash ows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using a risk-free discount rate.
The group expects to utilise 0.5m of this provision within one year.

New accounting standards Comparative information for 2004 presented in these financial statements was originally reported under UK GAAP and has been restated to comply with IFRS following the groups transition to IFRS from 1 January 2004.
Details on the restatement of the groups 2004 comparatives, together with the groups accounting policies under IFRS, were published on 24 June 2005 and are available on the groups website, www.
Since that date, following agreements reached with the tax authorities, and as a result of further guidance provided in IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, the groups current tax liability has been increased by 6.3m with a corresponding addition to its deferred tax asset as at 1 January 2004.
In addition, since 24 June 2005, the company has completed the restatement of its own 2004 financial statements, which has resulted in a 47.1m increase to the groups revaluation reserve with a corresponding decrease in its merger reserve and retained earnings of 19.8m and 27.3m, respectively, as at 1 January 2004.
Also since 24 June 2005, in accordance with IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, the group has disclosed 0.5m of net exchange differences as at 31 December 2004 in a separate translation reserve.
Previously, 0.1m and 0.4m had been deducted from the revaluation and retained earnings reserves, respectively.
A summary of the changes that impacted pro t before taxation, pro t attributable to equity shareholders, basic earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations and net assets in the comparative period for both the group and the company is set out as follows: Prior year previously reported under UK GAAP, now reported under IFRS note 33 93 0 06-1014 ABP Accounts FINAL.

IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Principal difference The groups share of the results from its continuing and discontinued associated undertakings has been reported within the respective line items operating pro t, interest, other finance income cost and taxation under UK GAAP.
However, IAS 1 requires the group to report its post-tax share of results from continuing associated undertakings as a single-line item at the pre-tax pro t level.
In addition, IAS 1 requires the group to report its post-tax share of the results from discontinued associated undertakings as a single-line item at the post-tax level.
Impact This re-categorisation results in the groups pro t before taxation reducing by 3.3m for the year ended 31 December 2004 being 2.9m in respect of the share of taxation in associated undertakings and 0.4m in respect of discontinued operations.
This re-categorisation does not have any impact on the groups total earnings per share or the amount of pro t attributable to equity holders.
B. IFRS 2 Share-based Payment Principal difference The group and the company operate a number of share-based payment schemes under which options or shares are granted to employees.
Under UK GAAP, the group has recognised an expense in its income statement in relation to shares awarded under its all-employee UK Share Incentive Plan and under its Long-Term Incentive Plan, but no expense has been recognised in relation to options granted under the all-employee or executive option schemes.
Under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, the group is required to record an expense for all share-based payments based on the fair value of those payments as determined at the date of grant.
IFRS 2 also permits an entity to recognise a deferred tax asset in relation to its share-based payment expense to the extent that it is able to obtain a tax deduction upon exercise of the equity instruments granted.
Impact The groups and the companys IFRS 2 charge for the year ended 31 December 2004 has been calculated at 2.3m and 0.3m respectively.
The groups charge was partially offset by the reversal of 0.6m previously provided under UK GAAP and the companys charge was more than offset by the reversal of this amount.
The group and the company have applied IFRS 2 to all equity instruments unvested at 1 January 2005 and have recognised a deferred tax asset to re ect the tax deduction that the group and the company will be entitled to upon exercise of these equity instruments.
The deferred tax asset recognised in the groups and the companys balance sheets as at 1 January 2004 amounted to 1.7m and 0.1m, respectively and at 31 December 2004 amounted to 1.6m and 0.2m, respectively.
The group and the company also reversed accruals of 1.1m and 0.5m as at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004, respectively, in relation to the Share Incentive Plan that are no longer necessary under IFRS 2.

New accounting standards continued C. IFRS 3 Business Combinations Principal difference IFRS 3 requires positive goodwill to be carried on the balance sheet, subject to annual reviews for impairment with an initial impairment test at the date of transition.
Under UK GAAP, the group amortised goodwill over its expected useful economic life of 20 years.
Impact The adoption of IFRS eliminates the need for the group to record a goodwill amortisation charge within its income statement.
Consequently, 0.9m of amortisation charges recorded in the year ended 31 December 2004 have been reversed in the restated financial statements.
The groups goodwill balance of 14.5m at 1 January 2004 has been tested for impairment and will be retained at this level, subject to the results of future impairment tests.
D. IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date Principal difference In contrast to existing practice under UK GAAP, under IAS 10, dividends cannot be accrued at the balance sheet date unless the amount has been formally approved as at that date.
Under UK GAAP, the dividend charge is also recognised in the income statement: under IFRS, the dividend charge is not recognised in the income statement but is recognised directly in reserves.
Impact The groups and the companys accrued dividends of 28.0m as at 1 January 2004 and 27.9m as at 31 December 2004 have been removed from the restated balance sheets.
Both the interim dividend for 2004 and the final dividend for 2004 50.1m in total have been removed from the restated income statement.
In addition, accrued dividends receivable from associates of 3.5m at 1 January 2004 have been reversed, with a compensating addition to investments.
E. IAS 12 Income Taxes Principal difference IAS 12 requires a deferred tax provision to be recognised for all taxable temporary differences between the tax bases and the associated carrying amounts for assets and liabilities.
Under UK GAAP, there was no requirement to recognise deferred tax provisions on timing differences arising when non-monetary assets were revalued, unless revaluation gains were recorded through the income statement, or by the balance sheet date the entity had entered into a binding agreement to sell the asset and had recognised the gain or loss arising from the sale.
Impact The group will continue to revalue its investment property portfolio and, for operational land, will continue to adopt the 31 December 1998 valuation on its transition to IFRS.
Compliance with IAS 12 as at 1 January 2004 has been achieved by making a deferred tax provision net of relevant brought forward capital losses of 20.3m in relation to revaluation gains.
A similar additional deferred tax provision of 19.8m has been made as at 31 December 2004.
The adoption of IAS 12 resulted in a tax credit of 0.2m for 2004.
The group does not expect the additional deferred tax provisions created by IAS 12 to crystallise within the foreseeable future and anticipates that the ongoing utilisation of its tax capital losses will retain its cash tax rate close to that seen under UK GAAP.
New accounting standards continued F. IAS 17 Leases Principal difference Under UK GAAP and IFRS, leases are classi ed as finance or operating leases.
As a result of further guidance provided in IAS 17, some leases that were classi ed as operating leases under UK GAAP may be re-classi ed as finance leases under IFRS.
Impact The impact of the re-classi cation of a small number of operating leases as finance leases under IFRS results in an increase in property, plant and equipment of 4.3m and 3.8m as at 1 January and 31 December 2004, respectively, together with an increase of 4.6m and 4.2m to obligations under finance leases at the same respective dates.
In addition, pro t before taxation for the year ended 31 December 2004 is reduced by 0.1m.
G. IAS 19 Employee Bene t Principal difference Under guidance set out in IAS 39, pension scheme assets are disclosed at bid values, rather than at the mid-market values adopted under FRS 17.
Impact The adoption of bid values resulted in a reduction of 0.4m in the valuation of the groups pension scheme assets at both 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004.
These reductions, net of the associated reductions in deferred tax provision of 0.1m at each of 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004, have been incorporated into the groups IFRS balance sheet.
H. IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Principal difference Under UK GAAP, the company revalued its investments in subsidary undertakings at the balance sheet date to directors valuations.
However, under IAS such investments may be recorded at cost.
Impact The impact of recording subsidiary undertakings at cost results in the elimination of the companys revaluation reserve and a decrease in the companys investments of 716.9m and 661.0m as at 1 January and 31 December 2004, respectively.
In addition, as a result of the elimination of the companys revaluation reserve, 47.1m in respect of the capitalisation issue of shares that had previously been deducted from the companys revaluation reserve has been deducted from the companys merger reserve and retained earnings.
I. IAS 40 Investment Property Principal difference Under UK GAAP, the group has carried its investment property portfolio on its balance sheet at open market value with changes in the value of this portfolio arising as a result of its revaluation being recorded through the statement of total recognised gains and losses i. e. direct to equity.
However, under IAS, the adoption by an entity of the fair value model requires it to report any subsequent gains or losses through its income statement.
Impact IAS 40 will have no impact on the groups balance sheet.
The revaluation surplus of 3.4m for the year ended 31 December 2004 has been reported within the groups income statement.
