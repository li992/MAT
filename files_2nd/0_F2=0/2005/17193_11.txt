Both acquisitions were made in the year ended 31st December 2003.
These acquisitions were principally made to acquire the companies land banks and accordingly management have allocated the goodwill to the individual sites acquired as cash generating units.
56 Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report 2005 9.
Goodwill continued Impairment reviews were performed as at 1st July 2005 and 31st December 2005 2004: 30th June and 31st December comparing the value in use for each site with the carrying amount of land and work in progress together with the goodwill allocated to that site.
The value in use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of each site.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, expected changes in selling prices for completed housing units and expected changes in costs to complete the site.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks appropriate to the cash generating units.
The discount rate that is considered by management to be appropriate is the Groups weighted average cost of debt of 5.9% which equates to the cost of holding land investments.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
Expected future cash flows have been taken over the remaining period that the sites are expected to trade none of which extend beyond 2007.
As a result of these reviews an impairment of 7.3m 2004: 6.8m was recorded in cost of sales.
No adjustment was required to the carrying value of the individual sites.
The impairment arises as a result of the consumption of land on the sites acquired as these have been built out, in whole or in part.

The reversals arose mainly due to obtaining planning approval on strategic land interests that had been previously written down to net realisable value.

Trade and other receivables continued Proceeds from the sale of residential units are ordinarily received at legal completion.
Proceeds from the sale of commercial property units are received by progress billings or at legal completion.
Credit terms for the sale of serviced land are dependent upon the terms of the individual contract.
Trade receivables at the balance sheet date include amounts receivable from the sale of goods and services of 4.1m 2004: 2.1m, amounts due from construction contract customers for contracts in progress of 24.6m 2004: 27.8m and amounts due from construction contracts for completed contracts of 8.7m 2004: 11.4m giving a total of 33.3m 2004: 39.2m for amounts due from construction contracts.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of 0.7m 2004: 0.8m.
This allowance has been determined either by specific knowledge regarding individual debtors or by reference to past default experience.
At 31st December 2005, amounts of 0.5m 2004: 0.8m included in trade and other receivables are due for settlement after more than one year.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are trade and other receivables together with bank balances and cash, which together represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a number of counterparties and customers.

The floating rates are fixed in advance for periods generally ranging from one to three months.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft and short term committed and uncommitted bank facilities.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The fair value of floating rate loans at 31st December 2005 is considered to be equal to the book value as a result of the short period to maturity of the amounts outstanding at that date.
Fixed rate sterling bank loans of 79.9m 2004: 79.9m were arranged at fixed interest rates and expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate sterling bank loans for 2005 was 7.2% 2004: 7.2% with, at 31st December 2005, a weighted average period of 4.1 years 2004: 5.1 years for which the rate is fixed.
The fair value of fixed rate sterling loans has been determined by discounting the future cash flows at a market rate of interest for similar debt instruments.
Fixed rate US dollar bank loans expose the Group to fair value interest and cash flow currency risks.
The cash flow currency risks have been hedged using swap arrangements as detailed at 15 iv.
The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate US dollar bank loans for 2005 was 5.6% 2004: 5.6% with, at 31st December 2005, a weighted average period of 8.3 years 2004: 9.3 years for which the rate is fixed.
The fair value of fixed rate US dollar loans has been determined by discounting the future cash flows at a market rate of interest for similar debt instruments.
iv Derivative financial instruments Swap cash flow hedge The Group enters into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the cash flow risks arising from the Groups sources of finance.
As at 31st December 2005 the Group had outstanding long term US dollar debt of $100.0m.
In obtaining this funding the Group sought to achieve certainty as to both the availability of, and income statement charge related to, a designated proportion of anticipated future debt requirements.
60 Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report 2005 15.
Bank overdrafts, loans and derivative financial instruments continued At the date of drawdown of the $100.0m of fixed rate US dollar debt the Group entered into swap arrangements to swap this to 62.0m of fixed rate sterling debt.
After taking into account swap arrangements the fixed interest rates applicable to the debt were as follows: Fixed rate Amount payable m % Maturity 21.7 5.625 4.9.
2015 The swap arrangements are designated as a cash flow hedge against future currency movements.
The fair value of the swap arrangements as at 31st December 2005, which is based on third party valuations, was 5.8m 2004: 9.4m with a gain of 3.6m 2004: 5.1m loss credited directly to equity in the year.
Of the cumulative loss on derivative financial instruments 5.6m 2004: 3.8m gain was realised in the year and transferred to the income statement see note 4.
Equity share receivables The Group has entered into 8.0m 2004: nil of equity share agreements on newly completed residential properties during the year.
Under these agreements, the Group retains a fixed proportion of the equity in a newly completed residential property until the date of first resale or ten years from the date of the agreement, whichever is the earlier, when it will receive the fixed proportion of the market value of the property.
All agreements are secured by way of a second charge over the property.
The agreements were initially recognised at market value, discounted at LIBOR over the expected length of time to the redemption of the agreements, being 3.5 years.
The Directors consider that this is the appropriate length of time to discount the equity share receivables over.
The agreements are subsequently measured at fair value, which at the 31st December 2005 is estimated to be 6.9m.
The fair value has been estimated using the average of data from two national property price reports and applied on a national basis.
The combination of the initial discounting of the receivables and subsequent re-measurement at fair value has resulted in an expense of 1.1m 2004: nil being included in cost of sales in the year.
There is no significant concentration of credit risk as exposure is spread over a number of customers and the agreements are secured by way of a second charge on the property.
Equity share receivables expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk as no interest is charged upon the receivable.

Explanation of transition to IFRS This is the first year that the Group has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The following disclosures are required in the year of transition.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP and not presented under IFRS were for the year ended 31st December 2003 and the date of transition to IFRS was therefore 1st January 2004.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Effect of IFRS adoption on equity As at As at 31st December 1st January 2004 2004 Notes m m Total equity UK GAAP 917.8 775.6 Goodwill impairment v amortisation a 1.7 Negative goodwill not permitted b 4.5 6.9 Effect of discounting land creditors d 5.4 4.6 Dividend not recognised as a liability until declared f 26.9 24.0 Deferred tax timing differences h 4.4 8.8 Accounting for derivative financial instruments g 0.4 1.7 Share-based payments excluding deferred tax i 0.3 0.2 Total equity IFRS 937.8 794.6 Effect of IFRS adoption on the income statement Effect of UK transition GAAP to IFRS IFRS Year ended 31st December 2004 Notes m m m Continuing operations Revenue 1,282.3 1,282.3 Cost of sales a b d 918.8 2.9 921.7 Gross profit 363.5 2.9 360.6 Administrative expenses i 84.4 0.5 84.9 Operating profit 279.1 3.4 275.7 Interest received 0.4 0.4 Finance costs d 21.7 2.0 23.7 Profit before tax 257.8 5.4 252.4 Tax h 81.2 4.3 76.9 Profit from continuing operations being profit for the year 176.6 1.1 175.5 Attributable to equity shareholders of the parent 176.6 1.1 175.5 Earnings per share from continuing operations Basic 187.7p 1.2p 186.5p Diluted 186.9p 1.1p 185.8p Profit reconciliation Operating profit before Operating Profit Profit for goodwill profit before tax the year Year ended 31st December 2004 Notes m m m m UK GAAP 281.8 279.1 257.8 176.6 Goodwill impairment v amortisation a 1.7 1.7 1.7 Reverse negative goodwill b 2.4 2.4 2.4 Effect of discounting land creditors d 1.2 1.2 0.8 0.6 Share-based payments i 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.4 Deferred tax h 4.0 IFRS 282.5 275.7 252.4 175.5 68 Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report 2005 27.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Effect of IFRS adoption on the cash flow statement IAS7 Cash Flow Statements requires that the cash flow statement be reconciled to cash and cash equivalents as opposed to short term net debt.
As such the repayment of bank overdrafts of 17.8m has been included within the cash flow statement as a financing cash flow.
In addition there have been a number of reclassifications to categorise cash flows in the three required headings of operating, financing and investing.
The main adjustments were as follows: Net cash from operating activities was reduced by 80.2m as a result of the inclusion of tax paid offset by an increase of 3.7m in respect of the transfer of interest paid on deferred land creditors to financing activities: Net cash used in financing activities was increased by 20.2m and 32.9m from the inclusion of interest and dividends paid respectively and by 3.7m as a result of the reclassification of interest paid on deferred land creditors.
Notes Goodwill a IFRS3 Business Combinations requires that goodwill be capitalised at cost and then be subject to an annual impairment review.
The Group have elected to apply IFRS3 prospectively from the transition date, rather than restate previous business combinations.
All adjustments to provisional fair values made under UK GAAP at 31st December 2004 have been recorded at the date of transition.
These netted to nil but individually were: To reduce the fair value of available for sale investments by 0.1m to 1.0m: To write off 0.2m of irrecoverable corporation tax balances: To reduce the final instalment of cash consideration payable by 0.3m.
The goodwill carried by the Group relates to the acquisitions of Ward Homes Group Limited and Henry Boot Homes Limited in the year ended 31st December 2003.
These acquisitions were made, principally to acquire the companies land banks and, in accordance with IAS36 Impairment of Assets, the goodwill has been allocated to the individual sites acquired as cash generating units.
An annual impairment review was performed based on information available as at 31st December 2004.
This resulted in an impairment of goodwill totalling 6.8m, principally as a result of the consumption of land on these sites.
This represents an increase of 1.7m on the goodwill amortisation recorded under UK GAAP and further details of the impairment review are given in note 9 to this report.
Negative goodwill b IFRS3 does not permit the recognition of negative goodwill.
The negative goodwill arising on the acquisition of Frenchay Developments Limited has been credited to opening reserves at the date of transition.
The impact on operating profit for the year ended 31st December 2004 is a charge of 2.4m being the reversal of the negative goodwill credit recorded under UK GAAP.
Available for sale investments c Available for sale investments have been reclassified as non-current assets in accordance with IAS32.
Land purchases on deferred terms d In accordance with IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the Groups land purchased on deferred terms should be recorded at the discounted present value at the date of purchase.
The associated land creditor is then increased to the settlement value over the period of deferral, with this increase being charged as notional interest through the income statement.
The effect on the opening balance sheet was to reduce the value of the land bank by 7.1m, reduce land creditors by 2.5m of which 1.8m is due after more than one year, recognise a deferred tax asset of 1.4m and reduce opening reserves by 3.2m.
For the year ended 31st December 2004, this resulted in an increase in operating profit of 1.2m, a charge of 2.0m for notional interest and a related tax credit of 0.2m.
Deferred tax asset e The deferred tax asset of 0.3m, recognised within other debtors for UK GAAP, has been reclassified to deferred tax within non-current liabilities.
Events after the balance sheet date f Under IAS10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date only dividends declared before the balance sheet date can be recorded as a liability.
The final dividend is not declared until after the year end and consequently there is a requirement to remove the liability for final dividends for the years ended 31st December 2003 and 2004 respectively.
The impact of this adjustment is to increase net assets by 24.0m at 1st January 2004 and by 26.9m at 31st December 2004.
Hedging g As detailed in note 15 to this report the Group enters into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups sources of finance.
As a result of the adoption of IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement the Group is required to record the swap arrangements on the balance sheet.
The swap arrangements are designated as a hedge against changes in future cash flows as a result of currency movements.
Gains and losses on the fair value of these swap arrangements are taken to reserves until realised.
Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report 2005 69 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued The adoption of this standard, which has no net impact on the income statement, results in the following changes to the Group balance sheet: As at As at 31st December 1st January 2004 2004 m m Adjustment to record US dollar debt at amortised cost 9.8 6.0 Recognition of swap arrangements on balance sheet 9.4 4.3 0.4 1.7 Represented by recognition of hedging reserves 0.4 1.7 Deferred tax h IAS12 Income Taxes requires that full provision be made for the tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of assets and liabilities.
As such, adjustments have been made to record timing differences as detailed below: Income statement Balance Balance for the year sheet as at sheet as at ended Amounts 31st December 1st January 31st December taken directly 2004 2004 2004 to equity Asset liability Asset liability Credit charge Credit Notes m m m m Fair value uplifts 6.3 10.4 4.1 Share options i 0.3 0.1 0.1 0.1 Land creditors d 1.6 1.4 0.2 Other 0.1 0.1 Total impact 4.4 8.8 4.3 0.1 Reclassification from other debtors e 0.3 0.3 Deferred tax 4.1 8.5 4.3 0.1 Share-based payments i In accordance with IFRS2 Share-based Payments, the Group has recognised a charge for share options granted on or after 7th November 2002.
The fair value of these options has been calculated using a Black-Scholes model as detailed in note 19 of this report.
The charge is spread over the vesting period and is adjusted to reflect the actual and expected level of vesting.
The resultant charge to operating profit for the year ended 31st December 2004 in respect of share-based payments was 0.5m, including 0.1m in respect of the Groups expected liability for National Insurance on unapproved options.
An estimate of the tax base of share options at the end of the period is determined by reference to the market value of the related share and the exercise price of the option at the reporting date multiplied by the vesting period that has lapsed.
The deductible temporary difference results in the recognition of a deferred tax asset.
The deferred tax asset at 1st January 2004 was 0.1m and at 31st December 2004, 0.3m.
The resultant reduction in net assets in respect of the above changes was 0.1m at 1st January 2004 and nil at 31st December 2004.
