The following detailed disclosures with regard to the use of financial instruments and derivatives exclude short-term trade debtors and creditors where permitted by FRS13, Financial Instruments.
1 Foreign currency risk The Group hedges transactions primarily related to the purchase and sale of inventories denominated in foreign currencies through foreign exchange forward contracts.
These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements with respect to these transactions and related cash flows.
Gains and losses are deferred and accounted for as part of the underlying transactions.
The Group does not hedge profit translation exposure, unless there is a corresponding cashflow, since such hedges provide only a temporary deferral of the effects of movements in exchange rates.
Similarly, whilst a significant proportion of the Groups borrowings are denominated in US dollars, the Group does not specifically hedge all of its long-term investments in overseas assets.
Currency translation gains, amounting to 1.7 million 2004: 9.8 million in the year ended 30th January 2005, have been credited to reserves in relation to the translation of net assets in foreign currencies.
At 30th January 2005, the gross notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts to sell foreign currencies, all of which had maturities of less than one year, totalled 72.2 million 2004: 64.2 million and can be analysed as follows: Commitments to sell foreign currency Sterling equivalent Unrecognised deferred gains and losses 2005 2004 2005 2004 m m m m Euros 17.6 10.9 0.1 0.1 Australian dollars 3.5 0.6 US dollars 51.1 52.7 72.2 64.2 0.1 0.1 The commitment to sell US dollars and approximately half of the commitment to sell euros are linked to the Groups US dollar and euro denominated borrowings referred to below, which provide a hedge against the Groups US dollar and euro investments.
The unrealised exchange gains on these commitments have been reflected in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
In addition, at 30th January 2005, the Group had entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to buy 0.9 million 2004: 0.9 million of US dollars on which there was no unrecognised loss 2004: loss of 0.1 million.
The unrecognised deferred gains and losses in respect of foreign exchange forward contracts are estimated by reference to the amounts not yet recognised that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the contracts based on year end rates.
During the financial year, the Group has not used any other financial instruments to hedge trading foreign exchange rate exposures.
54 Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Accounts continued Note 16 continued The Groups primary translation exposure relates to the relative values of the pound sterling and US dollar.
Although the US business generates significant US dollar trading cash flows, the Groups borrowings are predominantly US dollar denominated.
Management anticipates that the ongoing US dollar interest and dividend obligations, together with US dollar trade payments in the UK, should continue to preclude the need to enter into any significant hedging of US dollar cash flows.
At 30th January 2005, the Group had the equivalent of 9.0 million 2004: 4.5 million of predominantly euro denominated net financial assets in non-functional currencies in relation to which future movements in foreign currencies could have a limited impact on consolidated profit.
2 Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a combination of retained cash flow, equity and non-equity shares and short and medium-term borrowings.
Procedures are in place to monitor and manage interest rate risk with derivatives being entered into when considered appropriate by management.
Financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups borrowings is as follows: 2005 2004 Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total m m m m m m Due within one year 0.1 0.7 0.8 0.1 2.8 2.9 Due between one and two years 82.5 23.6 106.1 0.1 0.1 Due between two and five years 0.2 0.2 85.5 20.0 105.5 Due over five years 121.0 0.5 121.5 124.9 0.2 125.1 203.8 24.8 228.6 210.6 23.0 233.6 The Groups borrowings are denominated in US dollars with the exception of the floating rate debt due within two years of 24.3 million, of which 18.5 million is denominated in euros and 5.8 million is denominated in sterling.
The Group has multi-currency bilateral bank facilities of 121.6 million, which are committed until mid 2006.
The facilities carry a LIBOR based floating rate of interest.
At the year end, 23.6 million was drawn on these facilities 2004: 20.0 million.
The weighted average interest rate attributable to fixed rate borrowings was 6.3% 2004: 6.6% and the weighted average duration of fixed rate borrowings was 5.0 years 2004: 6.0 years.
The Groups other financial liabilities comprise provision for dilapidation costs of 1.0 million 2004: 1.5 million note 19.
Non-equity shares A proportion of the Groups share capital is attributable to non-equity interests, in the form of cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares.
The rights and restrictions attaching to the preference shares are described in note 20.
Financial assets Cash at bank and in hand of 27.9 million 2004: 31.7 million relates principally to overnight deposits and current account balances held in trading operations worldwide and comprises nil 2004: 3.4 million in sterling, 15.7 million 2004: 14.5 million in euros, 5.2 million 2004: 7.4 million in US dollars and 7.0 million 2004: 6.4 million in other currencies.
All significant balances earn interest based on local market rates appropriate for the currency concerned.

Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 55 Notes to the Accounts continued Note 16 continued 4 Credit risk The Group monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its forward exchange contracts and does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties.
The Group would not realise a material loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
At 30th January 2005, neither the Group nor the counterparties were required to collateralise their respective obligations under these financial instruments.

60 Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Accounts continued Note 22 continued Prior year adjustment UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts, has been adopted with effect from 2nd February 2004.
UITF 38 requires that investments in own shares made in order to meet anticipated obligations under performance share plans be accounted for as a deduction from shareholders funds.
Prior to 2nd February 2004, the Groups accounting policy was to classify such investments as fixed assets and to amortise the cost over the performance period of the plan to which they relate.
The adoption of UITF 38 has been accounted for by way of a prior year adjustment.
The net impact on shareholders funds at 2nd February 2004 was nil, reflecting the reversal of the cumulative amortisation charge at that date of 1.1 million and the re-presentation of the cost of the ESOP shares of 1.1 million as a deduction from shareholders funds.
The reversal of the cumulative amortisation charge is disclosed on the face of the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The re-presentation of the ESOP shares as a deduction from shareholders funds is not a recognised gain or loss.
The prior year adjustment is analysed below.

These plans are devised in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries concerned and include defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
The assets of the plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.
The contributions to the plans are assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice principally using the projected unit method of valuation.
The net credit for the year relating to all of the Groups pension plans amounted to 1.6 million 2004: 2.9 million.
The Groups two principal plans operate in the UK and the US.
Further disclosures of these plans are set out below: UK Plan US Plan 6th April 31st October Last valuation date 2002 2004 mm Market value of investments at last valuation date 53.1 119.8 Regular pension cost 0.3 1.9 Interest on prepaid asset 6.7 Amortisation of variation 0.4 0.2 Total pension cost credit 0.7 5.0 Level of funding, being the actuarial value of assets expressed as a percentage of the accrued service liabilities 94% 262% The principal assumptions used in the actuarial valuation of the UK Plan were a weighted average projected investment return of 6.4% per annum, salary inflation of 4.3% per annum and pension increases of 2.8% per annum.
For the US Plan, the principal actuarial assumptions were a weighted average projected investment return of 8.5% per annum and salary inflation of 5.0% per annum.
Variations from regular cost are spread over the remaining service lives of current employees in the plans.
The final salary section of the UK Plan was closed to new entrants in 1998 as a result of which, under the projected unit method, the current service cost of the scheme will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Members at that date now receive benefits funded through a combination of the US Plan and the UK Plan, including contributions to the money purchase section within the UK Plan.
Employees joining the UK Plan since 1st January 1999 are entitled to money purchase benefits only.
An asset of 81.9 million 2004: 79.6 million is included in debtors due after more than one year, representing the excess of the actuarial value of the assets over the accrued service liabilities of the US Plan.

The UK defined benefit pension plan includes certain employees of Premier Farnell plc.
However, the contributions by Premier Farnell plc are accounted for as a defined contribution scheme, as the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the plan.
2 Post-retirement medical benefits In the US, the Group provides unfunded post-retirement medical benefits to certain US employees.
The method of accounting for these obligations is similar to that used to account for pension obligations.
The principal assumptions used in the most recent actuarial valuation undertaken at 30th January 2005 were a discount rate of 6.25% per annum and healthcare costs increasing by 9.0% per annum in the short term, reducing to an increase of approximately 5.0% per annum in the longer term.
At 30th January 2005, the provision for post-retirement medical benefits based on this valuation was 5.5 million 2004: 4.7 million.
The financial assumptions at 30th January 2005 used to calculate liabilities for post-retirement medical benefits under FRS 17, were as follows: Discount rate 6.25% 2004: 7.0% Medical inflation 9.0% decreasing by 0.5% each year to 5.0% over eight years 2004: 9.0% decreasing by 0.5% each year to 5.0% over eight years Premier Farnell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 65 Notes to the Accounts continued Note 28 continued 2 Post-retirement medical benefits continued Disclosures in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 17, Retirement Benefits continued Analysis of amounts charged to the profit and loss account in respect of post-retirement medical benefits for the year ended 30th January 2005: 2005 2004 m m Amounts charged to operating profit current service cost 0.2 0.2 Amounts charged to other finance income interest cost on liabilities 0.4 0.5 2005 2004 Movements in deficit during the year: m m Obligation at beginning of year 4.9 5.8 Contributions paid 0.4 0.4 Current service cost 0.2 0.2 Finance cost 0.4 0.5 Total loss gain recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses 0.4 1.2 Obligation at end of year 5.5 4.9 2005 2004 Analysis of amount recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses: m m Experience loss gain on liabilities 0.1 1.3 Loss on change of assumptions 0.5 0.7 Actuarial loss gain recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses 0.6 0.6 Currency translation adjustment 0.2 0.6 Total loss gain recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses 0.4 1.2 History of experience gains and losses: 2005 2004 Experience loss gain on liabilities m 0.1 1.3 Percentage of liabilities 1.8% 26.5% Actuarial loss gain recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses m 0.6 0.6 Percentage of liabilities 10.9% 12.2% Had the provision for post-retirement medical benefits been calculated in accordance with FRS 17, reported net assets and the profit and loss reserve, as at 30th January 2005, would not have been affected 2004: reduction of 0.1 million.
29 Related party transactions The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 8, Related Party Transactions, from disclosing transactions between the Company and other Group undertakings as all such transactions have been eliminated fully on consolidation in these financial statements.
30 Post balance sheet events At an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 9th February 2005, the Company amended its Articles of Association to give the Companys Directors the ability to limit the number of US residents holding ordinary or preference shares in the Company.
In particular, the Directors are now able to require US shareholders, whether holding directly or through nominees, to sell their ordinary shares or preference shares in order to be satisfied that the number of US shareholders is less than 300 in respect of each of the ordinary shares and preference shares.
On 9th December 2004, the Company applied to fide-list its ordinary shares and preference shares from the New York Stock Exchange and the fide-listing took effect by SEC order on 16th February 2005.
Notice of termination of the American depositary receipt, or ADR, programmes in respect of Premier Farnell plcs ordinary shares and preference shares was given to American depositary share, or ADS, holders on 9th December 2004.
Termination of the ADR programmes has taken effect and on 18th April 2005 the Bank of New York as depositary for the ADR programmes will commence selling the shares underlying any ADSs not surrendered by the relevant ADS holders and distribute the net proceeds of sale for the relevant ADS holders.
