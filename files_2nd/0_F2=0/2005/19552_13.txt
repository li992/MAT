Segment analysis continued The matrix approach of disclosing both the business and geographical segments as primary reporting formats provides the most useful information, as the Group is strongly affected by both differences in the services it provides and the geographical areas in which it operates.
The unallocated segment includes holding company costs, group bonuses and other expenses not directly attributable to the operating activities of the Group's business segments.
Segment assets include property, plant and equipment, goodwill, debtors and operating cash and mainly exclude investments.
Segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities and exclude taxation and corporate borrowings.
Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment, including intangible additions resulting from acquisitions through business combinations.
The Group manages its business segments on a global basis.
Operations are based in three main geographical areas.
The UK is the home of the parent.
Asia Pacific segment operations are based in Hong Kong, China, Japan, Phillipines, Singapore and Australia.
Europe segment operations are in Germany, France, Spain, Netherlands, Sweden, Italy and Poland.
The sales location of the customer is not materially different from the location where fees are received and where the segment assets are located.

Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations The assets and liabilities related to the Student Halls Long Lease 1 Unit Trust the Fund, in which, at 31 December 2005, the group held 100% of the units, have been presented as held for sale.
The assets and liabilties attributable to the Fund, which are expected to be sold within the next twelve months, have been classified as assets for sale and are presented separately in the balance sheet.
It is expected that the Groups share of these assets will be reduced to a small holding, with a maximum of 5%.
The Fund is included in the Group's unallocated activities for segment reporting purposes.
The proceeds of disposal are expected to exceed the net carrying amount of the relevant assets and liabilities.
Accordingly, no impairment loss has been recognised.

Pension scheme D fide ef fiin ne ed d c co on nt tr riib bu ut tiio on n p plla an ns s The Group operates the Savills UK Group Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution scheme, a number of defined contribution individual pension plans and a Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme in Hong Kong, to which it contributes.
The total pension charges in respect of these plans were 3,541,000 2004 - 2,704,000.
D fide ef fiin ne ed d b be en ne ef fiit t p plla an ns s The Group operates a pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested in managed funds units.
The contributions are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations.
The most recent actuarial valuation completed, using the projected unit method, was as at 1 April 2004.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments pre retirement, the rates of increase in salaries and the post retirement investment return.
The valuation showed that the market value of the scheme's assets was 39,398,000 and that the actuarial value of those assets represented 65% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
On 1 January 2004, the Group's contribution increased from 15% to 18%.
In addition, the Group made a lump sum prepayment of 10,000,000 into the Fund in September 2005.
Employer contributions were subsequently reduced to 12.5% from 1 October 2005.
The scheme has been closed to new joiners for pension benefits since 1 April 2000.

The adjustment for Share based payment relates to the transitional impact of the new accounting standard accounting for share based compensation.
The annual bonus is paid in a mixture of cash and deferred shares and the proportions can vary from one year to another.
Under IFRS the deferred share element is amortised to the income statement over the vesting period whilst the cash element is expensed in the year.
The adjustment above addresses this by deducting from profit the difference between the IFRS 2 charge and the value of the annual share award.
The gross amounts of the above adjustments are profits on disposals 0.4m 2004 - 11.2m, share based payment adjustment 1.9m 2004 - 3.9m and add back of amortisation of intangibles and impairment of goodwill of 0.9m 2004 - 0.6m.

These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.
The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business in which the CGU operates.
Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations: Growth rate 0% - 19% Pre tax discount rate 2% - 16% These assumptions have been used for the analysis of each CGU within the business segment.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the managements expectations.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments.

Reconciliation of UK GAAP to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS B Ba as siis s o of f P Pr re ep pa ar ra at tiio on n The numbers set out under IFRS below have been prepared on the basis of current interpretation and application of IFRS as at the date of signing of the accounts, subject to the exemptions set out below.
IFRS 1, First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, outlines how to apply IFRS to the consolidated financial statements for the first time.
The Group's transition date is 1 January 2004 and the standard permits certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS as at that date.
The Group has taken the following key exemptions or options as at transition: a Business combinations IFRS 3, Business Combinations: The Group has taken the option not to restate any business combinations that were recorded by the Group before the date of transition.
b Employee benefits IAS 19, Employee Benefits: From the date of transition, the Group has opted to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in full.

Further information regarding the operation of the Group's employee share schemes can be found on Page 48 of these Annual Report & Accounts.
Information regarding the calculation and allocation of the Group's bonus pool can be found on pages 43 and 44.
The Group policy under IFRS continues to be for the cost of shares at market value to be deducted from the total bonus pool before arriving at cash bonus payments to be made to the employees concerned.
Under IFRS 2 the expense relating to an equity-based share based payment is calculated with reference to the fair value of the option at the date of grant.
The expense is then spread equally over the period between the grant date or date of commencement of services and the vesting date.
As the options under the Group's schemes are all equity settled, the fair value is not re-measured but the yearly expense is adjusted for the estimated number of options expected to vest.
For any options that vest early, the remaining charge not expensed to date is charged in full on the date the early vest occurs.

Intangibles are contractual or legal rights or assets that are separable from the business and can include brands, trade names, contacts and websites.
IAS 38 requires an intangible asset with a finite useful life to be amortised over its expected life and tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired such as if losses are made.
Goodwill represents the remaining unidentifiable intangible assets of an acquisition after deducting the identifiable intangibles.
Goodwill is not amortised from transition and is subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill impairment of 639,000 made in 2004 under UK GAAP, remains as an impairment under IFRS.
Goodwill amortisation under UK GAAP of 2,915,000 for the year has been reversed.
In accordance with the transitional provisions within IFRS 1, an assessment was made regarding the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired for all business combinations from 1 January 2004.
A value of 1,262,000 has been placed on these intangibles which were all purchased in the final few months of 2004.
The adjustments further capitalise an intangible asset of 476,000 which is associated with the set-up of Europa Immobiliare No.
This amount was expensed under UK GAAP.
A deferred tax asset of 143,000 arising under UK GAAP is not recognised under IFRS.
Under IAS 38, software that is not an integral part of the operating hardware is treated as an intangible asset and is amortised over its useful life.
Software with a book value of 810,000 has been reclassified to intangibles and depreciation expense of 663,000 has been reclassified as amortisation.
