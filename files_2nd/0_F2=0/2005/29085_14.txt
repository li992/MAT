Non-current assets held for sale From time to time, Group companies inject capital into funds operated by the Group seed capital.
Where the Group holds more than 50 per cent.
of the fund in which it is investing and where voting rights are attached to the holding, the Group technically controls the fund and it becomes a subsidiary of the Group.
Where the Group is actively seeking to reduce its holding, the fund is classified as being held for sale as it is considered highly probable that the fund will not remain under the control of the Group one year after the original investment is made.
If the Group still retains control of the fund after this time, the fund ceases to be classified as held for sale and is consolidated.

The conditions no longer met were that either the funds ceased to be controlled by the Group through sale and or dilution of the Groups holding and became current assets seven funds, or that the funds were still controlled by the Group one year after being designated as held for sale and did not meet the criteria for continued held for sale classification four funds.

Controlled Foreign Company profits are also likely to arise in future periods.
A deferred tax asset of 11.3 million 2004: 11.5 million relating to realised and unrealised capital losses has not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence that there will be sufficient taxable gains in the future against which the deferred tax asset could be utilised.

These instruments comprised debt securities, forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
Where instruments have been used for hedging purposes, the underlying assets that are being hedged relate to investments in subsidiaries and current asset investments.
Fair value disclosures relating to such amounts are not disclosed above.
Fair value disclosures relating to the underlying assets are only disclosed above if these assets were financial assets.
e Hedges The Group has a number of overseas subsidiaries whose equity, revenues and expenses are denominated principally in local currencies.
In such cases, forward currency contracts with fair value at the balance sheet date of 2.3 million were being used to hedge foreign currency assets.
In relation to the Groups hedging of its seed and liquid capital investments, at 31 December 2004, the Group had futures contracts with fair value of 0.3 million hedging investments against market movements and forward currency contracts with a fair value of 9.0 million hedging investments against currency movements.
The use of forward currency contracts is due principally to the investment of liquid capital in US fixed income securities hedged to sterling.
The Group has a policy of hedging certain exposures as and when they arise.
Gains and losses made on hedges are recognised by marking to market, except for certain Private Banking transactions which are not deemed to be material.

Holders of the subscriber shares have no right to participate in the profits or assets of the Company and are not entitled to vote at general meetings of the Company, although they are entitled to receive notice of and attend such meetings.

f Other The Group has a contractual obligation to reinstate certain leasehold premises before expiry of the lease in 2018.
The Directors believe that this obligation cannot be provided for because it cannot be measured reliably.
Obligations of certain Group companies under the Euroclear settlement system are secured by charges on assets held on their behalf from time to time within that system and by cash deposits placed.
In the ordinary course of business, subsidiary undertakings have custody of customers securities, act as trustees and issue indemnities on behalf of customers who have lost certificates of title.
The Company and subsidiary undertakings have also provided letters of comfort to regulatory authorities and others that subsidiary undertakings will be capitalised adequately and will meet their contractual obligations.
Share-based payments The Group has the following share-based payment arrangements: Share Option Plan 2000 : Under this Plan, the Group grants market value share options over non-voting ordinary shares to executive Directors and other key employees.
Options usually become exercisable if the option holder remains with the Group for at least three years and, for executive Directors, the performance target has been met.
The performance target, in line with market practice, is that the Groups earnings per share growth defined as the earnings per ordinary share before any items considered exceptional, as derived from the Annual Report and Accounts must be at least four per cent.
per annum above the increase in the Retail Price Index over the initial three-year period.
Senior Executive Share Option Scheme 1986 and the Share Option Plan 1999 : Options over non-voting ordinary shares were granted to executive Directors and other key employees.
In line with market practice at the time the Senior Executive Share Option Scheme 1986 was introduced, the vesting of these awards was not subject to performance conditions.
Under the Share Option Plan 1999 the performance target of all option holders, including executive Directors, was that the Groups earnings per share growth must be at least two per cent.
per annum above the increase in the Retail Price Index over a minimum five-year period.
This performance condition was in line with market practice at the time of the award.
The Group no longer grants awards under these former plans.
Equity Compensation Plan 2000 : Under this Plan, executive Directors and other key employees receive awards over non-voting ordinary shares, normally structured as rights to acquire shares at nil cost.
These awards are subject to forfeiture and will vest in full on the third anniversary provided the participant continues to be employed within the Group.
Further details are given in the remuneration report on page 30.
All of the above share-based payment arrangements involve a maximum term of ten years for each option granted and are settled through the transfer of equity instruments of the ultimate parent, Schroders plc, to its employees.
Certain employees have been awarded cash-settled equivalents to these share-based awards.
The fair value of these awards is determined using the same methods and models used to value the equivalent equity-settled awards.
The fair value of the liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and at settlement date.

2004: 4.5 per cent.. b Equity Compensation Plan Under the Equity Compensation Plan, rights over 3,272,442 2004: 2,512,054 shares were granted during the year.

At 31 December 2005, NewFinance Capital had assets under management of approximately $2.5 billion with net revenues of approximately $20 million in 2005.
