ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following paragraphs summarise the more important accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accounts.
Basis of accounting The accounts of the company are prepared under the historical cost convention in compliance with all applicable accounting standards Financial Reporting Standards FRS, Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP and Urgent Issues Task Force abstract UITF and, except where otherwise stated in the notes to the accounts, with the Companies Act 1985.
The accounting policies have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of FRS 18.
The directors consider that the accounting policies set out below remain most appropriate to the companys circumstances, have been consistently applied and are supported by reasonable and prudent estimates and judgements.
The financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis as the immediate holding company has agreed that that it will continue to provide financial support to this company to enable it to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
Turnover Turnover comprises charges to customers for water, sewerage and other services excluding value added tax and is derived only from the United Kingdom.
Pensions The cost of providing retirement pensions and related benefits is charged to the profit and loss account over the period benefiting from the employees' services in accordance with SSAP 24.
Research and development expenditure Research and development expenditure is written off in the profit and loss account in the financial year in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on fixed assets relating to research and development projects is written off over the expected useful life of those assets.
Taxation The taxation charge in the profit and loss account is based on the profit for the year as adjusted for disallowable and non-taxable items using current rates and takes into account tax deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date, subject to the following: - provision is made for gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets only where, at the balance sheet date, there is a commitment to dispose of the replacement assets - deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted 11 Notes to the Accounts Deferred tax is calculated at the rates at which it is estimated that tax will arise based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is discounted using the post tax yields to maturity that could be obtained at the balance sheet date on government bonds with maturity dates similar to those of the deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Investments Other fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value.
Intangible assets Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid for a business or an associate over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its economic useful life, which normally will not exceed 20 years.
Impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill are undertaken at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising on the transfer of the trade and net assets of The York Waterworks Ltd is being amortised over a 19 year period.
The net book amount of 13.2m is shown under intangible assets in the balance sheet at 31 March 2005.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets comprised the following:- Infrastructure assets Infrastructure assets comprise a network of systems being mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams and sea outfalls.
Expenditure on infrastructure assets to increase capacity or enhance the network and to maintain the operating capability of the network in accordance with defined standards of service is treated as a fixed asset addition and included at cost after deducting grants and contributions.
The depreciation charge for infrastructure assets is the estimated level of annual expenditure required to maintain the operating capability of the network based on an independently certified asset management plan.
Othe r tangible fixed assets Other tangible assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Finance costs incurred in respect of the construction of other tangible fixed assets are not capitalised.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is charged on other tangible fixed assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives, or the estimated useful economic lives of their individual major components, from the month following commissioning.
Useful economic lives are principally as follows:- Buildings 25 - 60 years Fixed plant 5 - 40 years Vehicles, mobile plant and computers 3 - 10 years 12 Notes to the Accounts Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Leased assets Assets which are financed by leasing agreements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee finance leases are capitalised in tangible fixed assets and the corresponding capital cost is shown as an obligation to the lessor in borrowings.
Depreciation is generally charged to the profit and loss account over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the term of the lease.
If the operational life of an asset is longer than the lease term, and the agreement allows an extension to that term, the asset may be depreciated over its operational life.
The capital element of lease payments reduces the obligation to the lessor and the interest element is charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding.
All other leases are operating leases and the rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straightline basis over the term of the lease.
Grants and contributions Grants and contributions in respect of tangible assets, other than infrastructure assets as described below, are deferred and credited to the profit and loss account by instalments over the expected economic useful lives of the related assets.
Grants and contributions in respect of expenditure enhancing the infrastructure network are applied in reducing that expenditure.
This is not in accordance with Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985, which requires tangible fixed assets to be shown at cost and hence grants and contributions as deferred income.
The presentation is adopted because infrastructure assets do not have determinable finite lives and therefore such grants and contributions would remain as liabilities in perpetuity.
The directors consider that the company's presentation shows a true and fair view of the investment in infrastructure assets.
Grants and contributions received in respect of expenditure charged to the profit and loss account during the year are included in the profit and loss account.
Stocks Stocks are stated at cost less any provision necessary to recognise damage and obsolescence.
Work in progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes labour, materials, and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Foreign currencies Individual transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the actual exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Profits and losses on both individual currency transactions settled during the year and unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Provisions Provision is made in accordance with FRS 12 for self insured claims, including an estimate for claims incurred but not reported.
13 Notes to the Accounts Financial instruments Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the company's exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its borrowings.
The amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are accounted for on an accruals basis through adjustments to the interest expense of the corresponding liability.
Divisionalisation of subsidiary undertakings As the Instrument of Appointment of The York Waterworks Ltd was merged with that of Yorkshire Water Services Ltd on 1 April 2000, its trade and net assets were transferred to the company at their net book value, which was less than their fair value.
As a result of the transfer, the value of the companys investment in that subsidiary undertaking fell below the amount at which it was stated in the companys accounting records.
Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985 requires that the investment be written down accordingly and that the amount be charged as a loss in the companys profit and loss account.
However, the directors consider that, as there has been no overall loss to the Group, this would fail to give a true and fair view.
The difference should instead be reallocated to goodwill at the time of the asset transfer, so as to recognise in the companys individual balance sheet the effective cost to the company of those net assets and goodwill.
The effect on the companys balance sheet of this departure is to recognise goodwill of 13.2m 2004: 14.2m, net of amortisation of 4.7m 2004: 3.7m.
The Group accounts are not affected by this transfer.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The banking arrangements of the company operate on a pooled basis with other group companies and the bank balances of each subsidiary can be offset against each other.
The company has guaranteed bonds at 6 7 8% due 2010 and 6.625% due 2031 issued by the parent company.
The liabilities under these guarantees amounted to 200m and 240m respectively at 31 March 2005.
The company has guaranteed bonds at 5.375% due 2023 and 3.048% due 2033 issued by the subsidiary company Yorkshire Water Services Finance Plc.
The liabilities under these guarantees amounted to 200 million and 100 million respectively at 31 March 2005.
PENSIONS The group sponsors a UK pension scheme called the Kelda Group Pension Plan KGPP.
The KGPP has a number of benefit categories providing benefits on a defined benefit basis and one category providing benefits on a defined contribution basis.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the KGPP was carried out as at 31 March 2004 when the market value of assets was 500.0m.
Under the assumptions adopted for SSAP24, the actuarial valuation of the assets represented 96% of the value of the accrued benefits, after allowing for expected future earnings increases.
The worsening in the funding level from that disclosed in last years accounts of 107.5% is primarily a result of the adverse changes in financial conditions experienced since the last actuarial valuation in 2001.
PENSIONS continued The pension cost under SSAP 24 'Accounting for Pension Costs' for KGPP has been assessed in accordance with the advice of Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited, using the projected unit method.
For this purpose, the actuarial assumptions adopted are based upon investment growth of 7.6% per annum pre-retirement and 5.6% post-retirement, pay growth of 4% per annum and increases to pensions in payment and deferred pensions of 2.8% per annum.
The actuarial value of the assets was taken as the market value of the assets.
In deriving the pension costs under SSAP 24, the surplus is being spread over the future working lifetime of the employees.
Yorkshire Water Services Ltd is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the KGPP and therefore accounts for pension costs on a contribution basis.
Contributions over the year ended 31 March 2005 were paid by members at 1.5%, 3%, 3.5%, 4%, 4.5%, 5% or 6% of pensionable pay depending on benefit category.
The company contributed at 200% of members contributions during the accounting year in respect of the majority of members.
Following on from the results of the 31 March 2004 actuarial valuation, the employer has agreed to increase its contributions to 475% of members contributions with effect from 1 April 2005.
The employers contributions have been assessed in accordance with the advice of Mercer Human Resource Consulting using different assumptions to those described above.
An accrual for unfunded benefits of 1.0m 2004 0.7m has been included in the company's accounts.
The companys total pension charge for the year was 5.8m 2004: 5.6m.
Additional disclosures required by FRS 17 in respect of the group scheme, including the major assumptions, are set out in the accounts of the parent company, together with disclosures of the market values of the assets and the FRS 17 value of liabilities of the KGPP at 31 March 2005.
ULTIMATE PARENT COMPANY Kelda Group plc, which is registered in England and Wales, is the company's ultimate parent company and controlling party and is the parent undertaking of the smallest and largest group to consolidate these accounts.
Copies of the group accounts may be obtained from the Company Secretary, Kelda Group plc, Western House, Halifax Road, Bradford BD6 2SZ.
