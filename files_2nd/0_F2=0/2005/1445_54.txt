14 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short term borrowings, loans, current and noncurrent investments, cash and short term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group has other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and credit.
Each of these are managed in accordance with Board-approved policies.
These policies are set out below.
The Group uses foreign currency forwards and options, interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements for the purpose of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks.
All hedging referred to is operational hedging and not hedging from an accounting perspective: hedge accounting as defined in IAS 39 has not been adopted.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to match the interest rate exposure on the Groups gross debt balance with that arising on the surplus cash position using interest rate swaps.
The net effect of this is to exchange the fixed rate interest paid on the two outstanding bonds fair value of $1,111m into floating rate interest referenced to six month US dollar LIBOR.
The majority of the Groups cash balance is invested in short dated commercial paper or held with third party fund managers who return a target yield referenced to seven day US dollar LIBID.
In addition to interest rate swaps, the Group uses forward rate agreements to manage any short term timing difference between the swapped debt interest expense and cash interest income.
Liquidity risk In addition to cash balances comprising fixed deposits, cash and cash equivalents less overdrafts and short term borrowings of $6,438m, the Group has an SEC-registered shelf debt programme of $4bn, of which $750m has been utilised through a loan note maturing in 2014.
The Board reviews the Groups ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the strategic planning process.
