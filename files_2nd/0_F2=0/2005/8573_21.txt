70 ITV plc 2005 annual report Conversion to International Financial Reporting Standards Following the Groups adoption of IFRS, the 2004 comparative financial information in these accounts has been restated and represented under IFRS.
The reconciliations below highlight the key impacts on both the profit attributable to equity shareholders and on total equity.
The Group has produced Preliminary International Financial Reporting Standards Financial Statements for 2004 which set out in greater detail the impact of IFRS on the Groups 2004 results and include more detailed reconciliations from UK GAAP of the balance sheets at 1 January 2004, 30 June 2004 and 31 December 2004 and the income statements for the six months ended 30 June 2004 and the year ended 31 December 2004.
This document is available on the ITV plc corporate website at www.
Reconciliation of profit attributable to equity shareholders from UK GAAP to IFRS Year ended 31 December 2004 m profit attributable to equity shareholders UK GAAP 139 IAS 19 Employee benets 3 IFRS 2 Share-based payment 3 IFRS 3 Business combinations 5 Other 1 profit attributable to equity shareholders IFRS 137 Includes related deferred tax effect Reconciliation of total equity from UK GAAP to IFRS 31 December 1 January 2004 2004 m m Total equity UK GAAP 3,418 1,656 IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date 53 20 IAS 19 Employee benets 389 274 IFRS 3 Business combinations 39 IAS 12 Taxation 5 9 Other 7 5 Total equity IFRS 3,109 1,388 Includes related deferred tax effect The principal IFRS adjustments are as follows: a IAS 19 Employee benets The principal impact of IAS 19 Employee benets on the Group is in relation to accounting for dened benefit pension schemes.
IAS 19 as amended requires dened benefit pension scheme accounting to be based on fair values at the balance sheet date.
Separate charges for operating and net nancing costs based on actuarial assumptions in place at the start of the year are required through the income statement while in the balance sheet under the accounting policy adopted the deficit is recognised in full with actuarial gains and losses arising taken through the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they arise.
The treatment and impact is broadly in line with that previously disclosed in accordance with FRS 17 under UK GAAP.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the balance sheet deficit.
The operating charge through the income statement in the year ended 31 December 2004 reduces by 5 million while the net nancing cost, for which there was no equivalent under UK GAAP SSAP 24, is 6 million.
The reduction reects the different measurement basis and the recognition of a short term curtailment gain on the Groups pension schemes which had a significant drop in active members as a result of the merger between Granada and Carlton.
There is a related increase in the deferred tax charge of 2 million.
The balance sheet shows a total IAS 19 pensions deficit of 672 million at 31 December 2004 1 January 2004: 422 million of which, under UK GAAP, the unfunded element of 27 million 1 January 2004: 22 million was previously recognised within creditors and an amount of 95 million with associated deferred tax asset of 28 million was included within provisions under acquisition accounting for Carlton.
A movement through the statement of recognised income and expense for the year of 123 million reects the actuarial gains and losses.
The deficit is shown before a deferred tax asset of 202 million 1 January 2004: 127 million recognised within non-current assets in the balance sheet giving a net deficit of 470 million 1 January 2004: 295 million.
These and other smaller adjustments lead to a net decrease in net assets of 389 million at 31 December 2004 1 January 2004: 274 million.
71 b IFRS 2 Share-based payments Under IFRS 2 Share-based payments the charge through the income statement is based upon the fair value of share options and awards granted.
The fair value of the equity instrument is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period through the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of the share options and awards is measured using either a Monte Carlo or Black-Scholes model as appropriate taking into account the terms and conditions of the individual scheme.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reect changes to the expected vesting except where forfeiture is due only to changes in the expected achievement of market based criteria.
IFRS 2 requires a charge for all such grants including awards, options and SAYE schemes unlike 2004 UK GAAP which based the charge on the intrinsic market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant and so, for the Group, a charge arose on awards only.
The Group has applied IFRS 2 only to share options and awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005 as permitted under IFRS 1.
As the Group has not previously presented the fair value of share options and awards granted, the IFRS 1 option to apply IFRS 2 to all share options and awards granted, including those granted before 7 November 2002, cannot be taken by the Group.
The charge under IFRS is 5 million higher in 2004 than under UK GAAP.
There is no impact on the net assets of the Group as the charge to the income statement is matched by an equal credit through reserves barring the deferred tax impact discussed under point e. c IFRS 3 Business combinations The Group has taken the IFRS 1 exemption from applying IFRS 3 to combinations occurring before 1 January 2004.
Consequently there is no impact on goodwill recognised before that date and so no impact on the 2004 opening balance sheet.
Business combinations occurring after 1 January 2004 have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3.
This impacts on the acquisition accounting for Carlton Communications Plc and the purchase of additional stakes in GMTV and GSkyB, which occurred during 2004.
The principal impact is that intangible assets which meet the denition for recognition under IAS 38 Intangible Assets and whose fair value can be measured are recognised separately from goodwill.
These assets are then amortised over their useful lives.
Additionally the fair values identied under UK GAAP must be revisited under IFRS.
The main impact of this is that the pensions deficits are brought onto the balance sheet using an IAS 19 Employee Benets valuation rather than the SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs valuation used under UK GAAP.
Both the intangible assets and pensions adjustments lead to associated deferred tax balances being recognised.
The net of these reduces the goodwill recognised.
IFRS 3 prohibits the amortisation of goodwill instead requiring that it is subjected to annual impairment testing.
This causes a reduction in the Group's amortisation charge for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 72 million.
Additionally goodwill balances held within investments in joint ventures and associates are also no longer amortised leading to a credit of 5 million to the share of profit of associates and joint ventures.
The balance sheet shows corresponding increases to goodwill and investments in associates and joint ventures.
The net impact on the income statement is to increase the amortisation charge in 2004 by 33 million, reduce the tax charge by 33 million and increase share of profits from joint ventures and associates by 5 million, giving a net increase in profit of 5 million.
On the balance sheet at 31 December 2004, goodwill is lower than previously reported under UK GAAP by 255 million, other intangible assets increase by 435 million, investments in joint ventures and associates increase by 5 million which together with an additional deferred tax liability of 146 million gives a net increase in net assets of 39 million.
d IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date Under IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date dividends are recognised in the period in which they are declared.
The impact on the balance sheet is to reduce liabilities by 53 million at 31 December 2004 1 January 2004: 20 million.
e IAS 12 Taxation IAS 12 Income taxes requires deferred tax to be provided on all temporary differences rather than timing differences which are considered under UK GAAP.
The deferred tax impacts of IAS 19 and IFRS 3 are discussed in a and c above.
The remaining deferred tax impact is in respect of a number of smaller items such as, share-based payments and properties which were revalued historically.
f Cash ow statement The material adjustments to the cash ow statement are principally presentational with cash ows now classied under the three main categories of operating activities, investing activities and nancing activities.
Additionally the denition of cash and cash equivalents is wider with liquid resources now being included in both the opening and closing balances and the cash ows.
72 ITV plc 2005 annual report ITV plc Company Financial Statements Company balance sheet 2004 2004 2005 2005 Restated Restated At 31 December: Note m m m m Fixed assets: Investments in subsidiary undertakings ii 1,791 1,646 Current assets: Amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings 17 79 Prepayments and accrued income 1 6 Cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits 632 453 650 538 Creditors amounts falling due within one year: Borrowings iii 65 436 Amounts owed to subsidiary undertakings 15 Accruals and deferred income 58 27 Other creditors 33 1 Dividends 54 45 210 524 Net current assets 440 14 Total assets less current liabilities 2,231 1,660 Creditors amounts falling due after more than one year: Borrowings iii 1,027 801 Net assets 1,204 859 Capital and reserves: Called up share capital iv 423 422 Share premium v 98 91 profit and loss account v 683 346 Shareholders funds equity 1,204 859 The accounts were approved by the Board of Directors on 8 March 2006 and were signed on its behalf by: Charles Allen John Cresswell 73 Notes to the ITV plc company financial statements i Accounting policies Basis of preparation As permitted by section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate profit and loss account, dealing with the results of the parent company, has not been presented.
The Company has adopted FRS 21 IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date for the first time in these accounts.
The principal impact of this standard is on dividend recognition.
Previously dividends were recognised in the period for which they were declared as relating to, now dividends are recognised during the period in which they are declared.
The impact on the 2004 comparatives is to reduce the dividend creditor by 53 million and the dividend recognised within the profit and loss account by the same amount.
The Company has adopted FRS 26 IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Measurement and FRS 25 IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation for the first time in these accounts.
As permitted under these standards the 2004 comparatives have not been restated and continue to be presented under previously applicable accounting standards.
The impact of adopting FRS 25 and FRS 26 is discussed in note viii.
The Company has adopted FRS 28 Corresponding amounts for the first time in these accounts.
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of certain assets and liabilities and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Company.
Control exists where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, and in subsequent periods at amortised cost.
The difference between cost and redemption value being recorded in the profit and loss account over the period of the liability on an effective interest basis.
Where the Company has identied that any such liabilities result in a mismatch between the accounting liability and the related derivative, the Company has adopted early the fair value option provision of FRS 26.
The effect of this is that the Company recognises any such financial liabilities at fair value in all periods subsequent to initial recognition, with resultant gains or losses recorded in the profit and loss account.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The Company uses a limited number of derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to uctuations in interest rates.
The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with movement recorded in the profit and loss account.
The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined by using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of swap counterparties.
Prior to adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26 from 1 January 2005 interest receipts and payments under interest rate swap and option agreements were accrued so as to match the net income or cost with the related finance expense.
No amounts were recognised in respect of future periods.
Dividends Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are declared.
