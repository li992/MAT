The Midshires Group, a business principally engaged in the operation and sale of vending machines and associated services throughout Central England, was acquired on 31 January 2006.
Acquisitions have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and contributed 4.4m to operating profit in 2005.
All 2005 acquisitions, as well as the two reported 2006 acquisitions, involved the purchase of 100% of the acquirees share capital or, as the case may be, all of the relevant assets of the businesses acquired.
On acquisition the assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired were adjusted to reflect their fair values to the Group.
This has included the separate identification of intangible assets in accordance with IFRS 3.
As permitted under IFRS 3 these provisional fair values will be finalised within the 12 month period from the relevant date of acquisition.
The provisional fair values applied in the prior year to the acquisitions made in 2004 have been finalised during 2005.
Adjustments were made to provisions to reflect more accurately the conditions at the date of acquisition based on information and knowledge which came to light during the 12 month post acquisition period.
Adjustments have also been made to reflect the associated taxation effects.
The net impact on acquired net assets reported in 2004 from these adjustments was 8.8m.
