NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS continued 17 Impairment testing of goodwill, brands and licences continued The recoverable amount of groups of CGUs including the goodwill that was allocated to them was determined by reference to their value in use.
To calculate this, cash flow projections were based on financial budgets approved by senior management.
Cash flow projections were those achieved in 2004 adjusted for expected growth.
The discount rate applied to cash flow projections in 2004 was 10.0% and cash flows beyond the budget period were extrapolated using a 3.0% growth rate in 2004.
This rate did not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
