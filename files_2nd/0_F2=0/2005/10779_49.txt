33 Pensions The group operates a defined benefit scheme, the N Brown Group Pension Fund, which provides benefits based on-final pensionable salaries.
The assets of the scheme are held separately in trustee administered funds.
The pension cost charged to the profit and loss account is calculated by a qualified actuary so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives within the scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 30 June 2003 using the projected unit method.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
It was assumed that the investment return would be 2.4% per annum higher than the rate of annual salary increase and 2.4% higher than the rate at which present and future pensions would increase.
N Brown Group plc 54 Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the accounts 33 Pensions continued At 30 June 2003 the market value of the assets of the scheme was 17,863,000 and the actuarial value of these assets represented 105% of the benefits that had accrued to members to the valuation date based on salaries projected to retirement or earlier exit.
There is no material difference between the calculated pension cost to be charged to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the scheme.
The group operates a number of much smaller pension schemes.
These schemes are not material in relation to the groups accounts.
The total pension cost for the group was 2.4m 2004, 2.3m.
As required by SSAP24, the figures included in the accounts in respect of the company pension scheme are based on an actuarial valuation carried out at 30 June 2003.
This does not take into account any impact of the movement in general stock market values since that date.
Any such impact will be reflected in the next SSAP24 triennial valuation based upon which subsequent pension costs will be determined until the adoption of FRS 17.
Additional disclosures regarding the groups defined benefits pension scheme are required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement benefits and these are set out below.
The disclosures relate to the third year of transitional provisions.
The actuarial valuation described above has been updated at 26 February 2005 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of FRS 17.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.

It has been agreed with the Trustees that contributions for the next ten years will remain at that level.
The scheme is a closed scheme and therefore, under the projected unit method, the current service cost would be expected to increase.
