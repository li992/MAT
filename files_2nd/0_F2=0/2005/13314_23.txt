This principally resulted in separate Asia Pacific and South Africa Other divisions.
For statutory purposes, the businesses within these geographic divisions have been reallocated back to the relevant business segment in line with the requirements of IAS 14 Segmental Reporting.
The commentary in the Operating Review reflects this new divisional structure and not the segmental information presented above.
In addition, the commentary in the Operating Review is presented at constant exchange rates and before the amortisation of customer lists and exceptional items.
The tables that follow reconcile the segmental information presented above to the divisional performance referred to in the Operating Review on pages 8 to 21.

A summary of the 2005 goodwill allocation by business segment is shown below: North Asia UK Europe America Pacific Africa Total m m m m m m Textiles and Washroom Services 42.5 0.1 42.6 Pest Control 0.8 0.3 1.1 Tropical Plants 2.0 11.4 0.4 0.2 14.0 Electronic Security 10.8 4.1 4.1 19.0 City Link Manned Guarding 1.1 2.7 3.8 Other Facilities Services 0.3 0.3 12.2 49.4 18.2 0.8 0.2 80.8 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates.
There are significant individual goodwill balances within the Textiles and Washroom Services, Tropical Plants and Electronic Security businesses.
The key assumptions used by individual CGUs for value-in-use calculations were long-term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates.
For these individual businesses, the long-term growth rates were 0% to 2% in Textiles and Washroom Services, 0% to 3% in Tropical Plants and 0% to 2% in Electronic Security.
The pre-tax discount rates were 9% to 10% in Textiles and Washroom Services, 10% to 11% in Tropical Plants and 11% in Electronic Security.
No reasonable change in these key assumptions would give rise to an impairment.
The growth rates used by individual CGUs are based on the long-term growth rates predicted for the relevant sector and country in which a business operates.
They do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that industry or country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the relevant sector and country.
No goodwill impairment charges on continuing operations arose during the current or prior year.

There is limited concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables due to the groups customer base being large and unrelated.
The group has recognised a loss of 5.0m 2004: 5.5m for the impairment of its trade receivables during the year ended 31 December 2005.
The loss has been included within operating expenses in the income statement.
The convertible loan note relates to the disposal of the US plant services businesses to Ashtead Group plc in 2000.
At 31 December 2004, under UK GAAP, the carrying value of the note was 141.7m.
On adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 at 1 January 2005, the loan note was classified as loan and receivable and stated at amortised cost with an effective interest rate of 11.54%.
As a result, the carrying value of the principal was reduced to 112.7m and 4.6m was ascribed to the equity conversion option.
Refer to note 39 for further details.
At 1 January 2005, the interest accrued on the principal was 1.7m and deferred interest of 7.7m.
On 1 July 2005, the group entered into an agreement with Ashtead whereby it agreed to an early repayment of the loan note subject to certain financing actions and conditions being met by 15 August 2005.
On 3 August, Ashtead completed all these conditions and repaid 129.8m to the company in full settlement of the outstanding loan note obligations.
The total sum received comprised 119.5m loan principal and 10.3m of deferred interest and accrued interest then outstanding.
Other receivables consist primarily of a South African loan note and deferred consideration received in respect of non-core business disposals.
The South African loan note of 16.8m, relating to the sale of a minority interest in a South African subsidiary, has been classified as available-for-sale.
The loan note has been revalued at 31 December 2005, using a discounted cash flow model, and the revaluation loss of 0.8m has been taken directly to reserves and disclosed on the face of the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The South African loan note has an effective interest rate of 9.0%.
Other receivables include 20.1m of interest bearing and 0.5m of non-interest bearing notes with effective interest rates varying between 7.3% and 9% and deferred consideration received in respect of non-core business disposals.
The notes deferred consideration have final maturities between 2005 and 2008, although earlier repayments may be precipitated under the terms of the respective disposal notes sale agreements.
Apart from the South African loan note described above, deferred consideration disposal notes are classified as originated loans and receivables.

Provision has been made for the residual lease commitments together with other outgoings, after taking into account existing sub-tenant arrangements and assumptions relating to later periods of vacancy.
Environmental The group owns a number of properties in the UK, Europe and the USA where there is land contamination and provisions are held for the remediation of such contamination.
Self insurance The group purchases external insurance from a portfolio of international insurers for its key insurable risks in order to limit the maximum potential loss that could be suffered in any one year.
Individual claims are met in full by the group up to agreed self insured limits in order to limit volatility in claims.
The calculated cost of self insurance claims, based on an actuarial assessment of claims incurred at the balance sheet date, is accumulated as claims provisions.
The annual review of these provisions by external actuaries resulted in a decrease in the reserves and in the insurance charge to the income statement in the year of 0.3m 2004: 3.1m increase.
Other Other provisions principally comprise amounts required to cover obligations arising, warranties given and costs relating to disposed businesses.

The effective interest rate on the 500m note is 5.90%.
The effective interest rate on the 250m note is 6.20%.
For all other bonds the effective interest rate approximates to the coupon.
The floating rate bonds and the related cross-currency swaps that are not designated as hedges in accordance with IAS 39 are carried on the balance sheet at amortised cost and retranslated at the period end rate.
The related swap a derivative is marked to market at the period end date.
The exchange effect on the bond and the movement on the swap revaluation are both reported within finance costs and act as a natural hedge.
92 Rentokil Initial plc Notes to the Accounts Floating rate loans bear interest at rates, based on the relevant national borrowing rate benchmark equivalents e. g. LIBOR, which are fixed in advance usually for periods of between one and twelve months.
The group has no significant fixed rate debt except for the fixed rate bonds disclosed above.
These bonds are designated in fair value hedges which convert them to floating interest rates.
The groups floating rate exposure is managed using forward rate agreements which all mature within one year, except for contracts with a nominal value of 530m which mature within 13 months.
Other borrowings represent bank loans and overdrafts and are held at amortised cost.
Fair value hedge accounting has been applied to all the notes and related derivatives marked as FV fair value hedge in accordance with IAS 39.
The related derivative and the hedged note are both marked to market and the ineffective portion of the hedge is taken directly to finance costs.
Where no hedge accounting has been applied, all the notes and related derivatives have been marked as NH non-hedge and any changes are taken to finance costs.
Net investment hedging The group has designated the Japanese Yen bank borrowings and the 500m note as hedges of the net investment in its subsidiaries in Japan and the eurozone.
The fair value of the Japanese Yen borrowings at 31 December 2005 was 6.4m and the euro note 364.7m.
The foreign exchange gain of 0.2m on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in exchange reserves.

The fair value of other short-term borrowings and long-term borrowings under which short-term drawings are made under committed credit facilities which mature in October 2006 approximate to their book values given their short-term maturity.
Other debtors include a balance of 143.4m in respect of a convertible loan note issued by Ashtead Group plc Ashtead in partial consideration for their purchase of the groups former US plant services business.
The note has a final maturity date of 31 March 2008 and interest accrues at 5.25% per annum.
At 31 December 2004, 9.4m of this balance is represented by accrued interest.
During 2004, Ashtead announced that it had successfully completed both the refinancing of its senior secured bank credit facilities and then issued a ten year 120m high yield bond in the capital markets.
Ashtead stated that in taking such actions they had refinanced approximately 75% of their debt during 2004 and extended their debt maturities to 5.5 years.
The new $675m asset based senior syndicated loan facility is committed to November 2009 subject only to the convertible loan note being repaid prior to November 2007.
As a result of the above refinancing arrangements, certain consequential amendments were made to the terms of the convertible note.
As a result of these amendments, Ashtead agreed to pay the noteholder, BET Ltd, 3.5m of accrued interest for the period of 1 October 2003 to 16 April 2004 on 16 April 2004.
In addition it was agreed that all other previously deferred interest, totalling 7.4m, would become payable at the earlier of the note repayment date or 31 March 2008.
Interest will accrue on this deferred interest sum at the Barclays Bank PLC UK base rate plus 2%.
The original note principal amount, maturity date and interest rate have been unchanged by these amendments.
The noteholder has also subsequently received 3.5m of interest on its normal due dates in October 2004 and April 2005, together with a 2m fee in November 2004 upon the full refinancing of Ashteads senior secured debt.
On 15 March 2005, Ashtead announced its interim results for the nine months to 31 January 2005 and updated the market on its trading prospects.
These indicated that the company had performed strongly in the third quarter and that trading conditions in all its markets remained good.
Since their latest trading announcement, the Ashtead share price has risen from 99.75p to 105.20p as at the latest practical date prior to the publication of this report.
In accordance with FRS 13 disclosure requirements a fair value of 124.9m has been ascribed to the convertible note.
This has been calculated after discounting the cash flows of the note in accordance with the conditions prevailing at 31 December 2004 at the then market interest rates and after due adjustment for credit risk.
Included within the 2004 fair value sum is an amount of 4.6m which has been ascribed to the equity conversion option.
This sum has been calculated using recognised market option pricing methodology, an Ashtead share price as at 31 December 2004 of 77.25p and historic share price volatility data.
The company has noted the gradually improving trading outlook of Ashtead, together with the positive refinancing actions that have been undertaken during 2004.
The company will continue to monitor any further announcements by Ashtead and take any actions as may be required in the future to protect the noteholders rights.
98 Rentokil Initial plc Notes to the Accounts Also included within other debtors is a ZAR220.6m 17.6m loan note that was received in 2004 as deferred consideration from the disposal of a 25.1% interest in the South African business.

It is anticipated that the loan will be repaid over a period of ten years.
Debtors include 20.6m of interest bearing and 1.5m of non-interest bearing notes and deferred consideration received in respect of non-core business disposals.

Retirement benefit obligations Apart from the legally required social security state schemes, the group operates a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The major schemes are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The principal scheme in the group is the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme RIPS in the United Kingdom, which has a number of defined benefit sections which are now closed to new entrants.
On 19 December 2005, a detailed consultation began between the company and the active members of the RIPS on the freezing of the future accrual of benefits for active members.
The RIPS valuation was performed on the existing basis and therefore excludes the proposal to freeze future accrual of pension benefits to active members.
Actuarial valuations of the UK scheme are carried out every three years.
The most recent valuation was at 31 March 2005.
These defined benefit schemes are reappraised annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial assumptions in accordance with IAS 19 requirements.
The principal assumptions used for the UK RIPS scheme are shown below.
2005 2004 Weighted average % Discount rate 4.7% 5.3% Expected return on plan assets 6.3% 7.0% Future salary increases 3.6% 3.5% Future pension increases 2.8% 2.7% Mortality assumptions At 31 December 2005, it is assumed that a man retiring at age 65 will live a further 20.7 years if he is a staff member, or 22.3 years if he is an executive member.
The corresponding figures for women are 23.4 and 25.1 years respectively.
At 31 December 2004, no distinction was made between staff and executive members and it was assumed that a man retiring at age 65 would live a further 20.0 years and a woman a further 22.6 years.

Failing this, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over a greater period up to a maximum of ten years is at least 4% in excess of the UK rate of inflation.
Level 2: The exercise condition under Level 2 is by reference to total shareholder return, ie.
the appreciation of the share price including reinvested dividends in comparison with the performance of the FTSE 100 index and a defined group of support services companies being used as comparators, during three consecutive calendar years commencing in the year in which the option is granted, on the following basis: If the company achieves a median performance in relation to the FTSE 100 index, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile of the FTSE 100 and, in addition, if the company achieves a median performance in the group of support services companies, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile in a group of support services companies.
Deferred share schemes: shares have been offered to executive directors and sector managing directors to compensate for loss of bonuses or share options in their previous employment on joining the group during 2005.

If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2005, these acquisitions would have contributed 78.6m to revenue and 1.7 m to operating profit after amortisation of customer lists acquired of 5.6m.
On 21 June 2005, the legal parent company new holding company acquired the entire share capital of the old holding company.
This has been treated as a reverse acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The book value and fair value of the net assets of the legal parent prior to acquisition were 50,002.
The legal parent company did not trade prior to acquisition.
See note 27 for further details.
Contingencies The group has contingent liabilities of 2.0m 2004: 2.4m relating to guarantees in respect of third parties.
In addition there are contingent liabilities in respect of environmental issues, tax and litigation, none of which are expected to give rise to any significant loss.
Capital commitments Capital expenditure contracted for at the balance sheet date but not yet incurred is as follows: 2005 2004 m m Property, plant and equipment 13.2 13.6 Intangible assets 1.1 0.6 14.3 14.2 35.
Operating leases The group leases properties, vehicles, plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The lease expenditure charged to the income statement during the year is disclosed in note 2.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2005 2004 m m Not later than one year 5.6 6.2 Later than one year and not later than five years 20.0 20.7 Later than five years 14.3 17.5 39.9 44.4 112 Rentokil Initial plc Notes to the Accounts 36.

All transactions between these entities and the group were transacted at arms length during the ordinary course of business and have been eliminated on consolidation.
Nippon Calmic Ltd 49%, Rezayat Sparrow Arabian Crane Hire Co Ltd disposed during 2005 and Rezayat Deborah Saudi Arabia Co Ltd disposed during 2005 are associates during 2005 and their balances are disclosed in note 14.
There are no significant transactions between Nippon Calmic Ltd and other group companies.
The group recharges the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme with costs of administration and independent pension advice borne by the group.
The total amount of recharges in the year ended 31 December 2005 was 1.6m 2004: 1.3m.
The group has a loan to a consortium of private investors which enabled them to purchase a 25.1% stake in the South African business.
The group has a receivable from this consortium of 16.8m 2004: 17.6m at the end of the year.
It is anticipated that the loan will be repaid over a ten year period.
The repayment of the loan will be dependent upon the future dividends generated by the business.
Post-balance sheet events The following events have occurred since the end of the year: On 25 January 2006, the group announced the closure of the loss-making UK linen and workwear operations of Initial Hygiene UK.
It is estimated that cash closure costs of 13m to 18m will be incurred in 2006 as a result of the closure but should be significantly offset by the sales of surplus property.
On 8 February 2006, the group confirmed that it was exploring the possible disposal of its manned guarding businesses in the UK, Canada, the USA and Belgium.
On 7 March, it announced the completion of the disposal of the UK manned guarding business for a gross consideration of 74.8m and on 10 March it announced the completion of the disposal of the Canadian manned guarding business for a gross consideration of 30.3m.
The group continues to explore the possibility of disposing the remaining manned guarding businesses in the USA and Belgium.
On 1 March 2006, the group announced the completion of the acquisition of J. C. Ehrlich Co. Inc. Ehrlich, for a gross consideration of US$141.8m.
Valuation and adjustments to assets acquired is still being reviewed.
Ehrlich is the largest independently-owned pest control company in the US and the fourth largest pest control company in the US overall.
The group launched a 300m issue of notes under its EMTN programme on 21 March 2006.
The notes will carry a coupon of 5.75% per annum and will mature on 31 March 2016.

IFRS Transitional adjustments The previously published financial statements under UK GAAP were restated on an IFRS basis in the Transitional Document and were externally published on 27 July 2005.
The Transitional Document is available on the groups website www.
com and includes presentational changes and detailed adjustments by line item.
A reconciliation of equity at 1 December 2004, 31 December 2004 and profit for the financial year to 31 December 2004 is provided below with an explanation of the transitional adjustments.

IAS 12 Income taxes 1.0 Minority interests 1.7 Profit for the year including discontinued 192.1 114 Rentokil Initial plc Notes to the Accounts Explanation of the differences between UK GAAP and IFRS which affect the group a. IAS 19 Employee Benefits Defined benefit pension schemes are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.
The group has elected to take the actuarial gains and losses through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
A separate charge was made in the Consolidated Income Statement, which comprises a service cost and a finance cost, with the service cost charged to operating profit and the finance charge forming part of finance costs.
The expected return on pension plan assets is recognised as finance income.
On 3 November 2005, the group announced that the UK defined benefit pension fund deficit under IAS 19 had been restated after the groups actuary finalised their work on the April 2005 triennial valuation for the fund.
Following the review, the defined benefit pension deficit adjustment was increased by 35.5m to 323.3m at 31 December 2004.
Other employee benefits in the main represent the recording of holiday pay entitlement earned but not taken at the balance sheet date, long-term service awards and post-employment medical plans.
Post-employment benefits are actuarially valued and recorded as a liability on the balance sheet just like defined benefit pension plans.
b. IFRS 3 Business Combinations Under UK GAAP, individual intangible assets in businesses acquired were not separately recorded but were subsumed within the overall value of goodwill recognised and consolidated on acquisition.
The group ascribed an indefinite life to this goodwill and, in accordance with FRS 10, was retained on the balance sheet and tested for impairment annually.
IFRS 3 requires the recognition of intangible assets on business combinations if certain criteria are met.
For business combinations made by the group, the value attributable to customer lists or portfolios acquired is treated as an intangible asset and valued separately from goodwill, which remains on the balance sheet and is tested for impairment annually.
The value attributable to the customer lists or portfolios acquired intangible asset is then amortised over the expected life of that asset.
The group has not taken the exemption available under IFRS 1 in respect of acquisitions made since 1 January 1998.
Instead, in order to aid the comparability with the treatment of future acquisitions, all acquisitions made since 1 January 1998, when FRS 10 was adopted, have been restated and the value attributed to intangible assets has been recognised and amortised over the expected life of the asset.
As a result, a gross intangible asset totalling 155.2m has been recognised at the date of transition and the group has incurred an amortisation charge of 22.2m in 2004 under IFRS, which was not present under UK GAAP.
Partly offsetting this amortisation charge is the reversal of the goodwill impairment charge of 14.4m made under UK GAAP.
This charge is reversed, as the total of the restated intangible assets, including goodwill, for the respective business combinations in the IFRS balance sheet at 31 December 2004 is already below the level of impaired goodwill balances in the UK GAAP accounts as a result of cumulative amortisation.
The net effect of these adjustments will be to increase net liabilities by 55.2m.
The 16.4m goodwill adjustment written off to equity under UK GAAP at 31 December 2004 was treated as a transitional adjustment under IFRS and the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2004 relating to goodwill was therefore reduced by this amount as a result of the UK GAAP error.
This UK GAAP error was revealed following a detailed review of the goodwill balance in preparation for transition to IFRS and necessitated an adjustment to the consideration and goodwill in respect of one acquisition made in 2000.
Goodwill on divested businesses that was written off on acquisition under UK GAAP remains written off in reserves under IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The 3.3m IFRS adjustment reverses the recycling of goodwill on disposed businesses.
c. IAS 38 Intangible Fixed Assets Under UK GAAP, the group had opted to expense all development costs as incurred.
Development costs meeting the definition specified under IAS 38 have been capitalised under IFRS resulting in an increase in intangible fixed assets of 0.7m, with no material effect on the 2004 Consolidated Income Statement.
Rentokil Initial plc Notes to the Accounts 115 Notes to the Accounts continued 38.
IFRS Transitional adjustments continued d. IAS 21 Foreign currencies Under UK GAAP SSAP 20, foreign currency borrowings that are regarded as part of the financing of an investment in a foreign subsidiary are considered quasi equity.
Exchange differences on re-translation of quasi equity have previously been reported as movements in reserves.
Under IAS 21 Foreign currencies, foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at reporting period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement except when deferred in equity as qualifying net investment hedges.
Foreign exchange differences for financing of investments, which are considered quasi equity, are reported in reserves.
Other foreign exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
The foreign exchange effect arising from the adoption of IAS 21 relating to the change in functional currency on the corporate entities has been reflected in the restatement of the 2004 results.
e. IFRS 2 Share-based payments Equity instruments granted to employees are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement based upon their fair value at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period of the various share option schemes operated by the group.
f. IAS 10 Post-balance sheet events dividends on paid basis Under UK GAAP, dividends are provided at the balance sheet date on the basis of the dividend proposed by the board.
Under IFRS, a provision for dividends is only made once the proposed dividend has been approved by shareholders.
As a result, the dividends provided under UK GAAP have been removed, giving rise to a reduction in liabilities of 86.1m.
g. IFRS 1 Equipment for rental stated at historical cost An adjustment has been made to equipment for rental assets manufactured by group companies to bring them back to historical cost.
The adjustment was made to eliminate inter-group profit on equipment for rental supplied by other group companies.
This UK GAAP error was revealed during the IFRS transition exercise.
There was no impact on the Consolidated Income Statement as a result of this adjustment.
h. IAS 17 Leasing Some leases previously treated as operating leases under UK GAAP have been reclassified as finance leases to comply with IAS 17 Leasing.
Operating lease costs shown within operating profit under UK GAAP have been restated and replaced with depreciation and finance interest.
Depreciation is charged to operating income and the related finance costs are charged below operating income under finance costs.
Operating lease rental payments are used to decrease the finance lease obligation over the lease term.
The net decrease on the balance sheet is 0.6m 1 January 2004: 0.7m.
i. IAS 12 Income taxes The adjustment of 96.8m on the balance sheet represents, in the main, the tax effects of the IFRS adjustments.
In addition, adjustments have been made for other temporary differences in respect of unremitted earnings, which were not recognised under UK GAAP.
IAS 12 also requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities arising on temporary differences in respect of intangible assets in business combinations.
This has been adjusted for all the relevant business combinations since 1 January 1998.
There is no significant change to the Cash Flow Statement.
116 Rentokil Initial plc Notes to the Accounts 39.
IAS 39 Financial Instruments The group was not required to and did not adopt IAS 39 Financial Instruments until 1 January 2005.
There was, therefore, no impact on the 2004 results.
The adoption of IAS 39 with effect from 1 January 2005 required certain financial assets and liabilities to be valued on a mark to market basis.
The group applied hedge accounting, with effect from 1 January 2005, for certain qualifying hedge relationships to reduce some of this volatility.
The mark to market impact on the balance sheet at 1 January 2005 is disclosed below: IAS 39 Book transition value UK GAAP adjustment 1 Jan 05 1 Jan 05 at 1 Jan 05 m m m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the groups operations: Investments Government gilts marked to market 6.6 6.6 other marked to market 0.1 0.1 Current and non-current receivables Ashtead loan note principal restated at amortised cost 112.7 134.0 21.3 South African loan note marked to market 17.6 17.6 Other deferred consideration disposal notes 4.5 4.5 Cash and cash equivalents 199.5 199.5 Short-term borrowings: Medium-term notes fair value hedge marked to market 9.8 10.5 0.7 Medium-term notes non-hedge restated at amortised cost 125.9 122.0 3.9 135.7 132.5 3.2 Other borrowings excluding finance leases 58.2 58.2 193.9 190.7 3.2 Long-term borrowings: Medium-term notes fair value hedge marked to market 653.2 619.2 34.0 Medium-term notes non-hedge restated at amortised cost 20.1 20.6 0.5 673.3 639.8 33.5 Other borrowings excluding finance leases 480.5 480.5 1,153.8 1,120.3 33.5 Unamortised note issue costs included within note carrying value 1.6 1.6 Accrued interest on medium-term notes included within note carrying value 13.9 13.9 Derivatives marked to market at 1 January 2005 28.3 28.3 Total IAS 39 transitional adjustment at 1 January 2005 17.4 Government gilts included within cash have been reclassified to investments within the UK GAAP column for comparability purposes.
On adopting IAS 39 prospectively from 1 January 2005, net liabilities increased by 17.4m, principally resulting from restating financial assets and liabilities at fair value or on an amortised cost basis.
IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts IFRS 4 does not permit general insurance reserves.
As a result, the equalisation reserve held on the balance sheet under UK GAAP 0.7m has been reversed to equity.
Deferred acquisition costs held within other receivables on insurance contracts totaling 0.2m were also taken to reserves.
A total adjustment of 0.3m net of deferred taxation of 0.2m was therefore required to restate the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2005 in compliance with IFRS 4.
