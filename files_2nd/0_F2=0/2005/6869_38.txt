Accounting estimates and judgements Critical accounting judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies Certain critical accounting judgements made in applying the Groups accounting policies are described below: Finance and operating leases The inception of the shop leases has taken place over a long period of time and many date back a significant number of years.
They are combined leases of land and buildings.
It is not possible to obtain a reliable estimate of the split of the fair values of the lease interest between land and buildings at inception.
Therefore, in determining lease classification the Group evaluated whether both parts are clearly an operating lease or a finance lease.
Firstly, land title does not pass.
Secondly, because the rent paid to the landlord for the buildings is increased to market rent at regular intervals, and the Group does not participate in the residual value of the building it is judged that substantially all the risks and rewards of the building are with the landlord.
Based on these qualitative factors it is concluded that the leases are operating leases.
Explanation of transition to IFRSs As stated in section b of the significant accounting policies, these are the Groups first consolidated accounts prepared in accordance with IFRSs.
The significant accounting policies set out on pages 32 to 36 have been applied in preparing the accounts for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2005, the comparative information presented in these accounts for the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2005 and in the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 28 December 2003 the Groups date of transition.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the Group has adjusted amounts reported previously in accounts prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRSs has affected the Groups financial position, financial performance and cashflows is set out in the following tables and notes.

The items are then depreciated based on the deemed cost over their remaining useful economic lives.
This has been adopted in respect of one freehold property.
Impact Under UK GAAP the depreciation charge in respect of the asset was 9,000 and under IFRS the charge is 34,000 resulting in an increased charge to operating profit of 25,000. b Employee benefits Principal difference Under UK GAAP, the Group measures pension commitments and other related benefits in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
Additional disclosures were given in accordance with the transitional requirements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
Under IFRS, the Group measures pension commitments in accordance with the amended IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
IAS 19 is similar to FRS 17 in that it adopts a balance sheet approach, bringing the surplus deficit of the pension scheme onto the balance sheet.
However, FRS 17 dictates that all actuarial gains and losses are to be recognised directly in reserves, whereas IAS 19 also includes an alternative option allowing actuarial gains and losses to be held on the balance sheet and released to the income statement over a period of time.
Greggs has elected not to adopt this alternative option.
Impact Under SSAP 24, a pension charge of 3,290,000 was recognised in operating profit in 2004.
Under IFRS a charge of 2,092,000 is recognised.
Therefore there is a net credit to operating costs of 1,198,000.
The actuarial loss of 903,000 is recognised in the statement of recognised income and expenses.
Due to the deferred tax impact the income statement tax adjustment is a charge of 359,000, resulting in an overall credit of 839,000 to profit for the year.
The deferred tax credit that relates to the actuarial loss of 271,000 is recognised in the statement of recognised income and expenses resulting in an overall charge of 632,000. c Share-based payments Principal difference The Group operates a number of share-based incentive schemes that are impacted by IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
Under UK GAAP no expense has been recognised for awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme as the intrinsic value the difference between the exercise price and the market value at the date of grant was nil or for awards under the SAYE scheme as this was exempt under UITF17.
Under IFRS, an expense is recognised in the income statement for all share-based payments.
This expense has been calculated based on the fair value at the date of the awards using pricing models appropriate to the schemes.
Impact This has resulted in a charge for the full year of 124,000, recognised within operating costs.
d Dividends Principal difference Under UK GAAP, the dividend charge is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Under IFRS, the dividend is not recognised in the income statement but is recognised directly in reserves.
Impact Both the interim and the final dividend for 2004 have been reversed from the income statement with an impact of 11,524,000.

Explanation of transition to IFRSs continued Notes to the reconciliation of the balance sheets a Deferred tax on rolled over gains Principal difference Under IAS 12 a deferred tax provision must be made in respect of all taxable temporary differences including rolled over capital gains.
Under UK GAAP deferred tax was not provided in respect of these rolled over gains.
Transition impact A deferred tax liability has been included in the transition consolidated balance sheet of 856,000 parent company 295,000.
Impact as at 1 January 2005 There is no movement on the deferred tax liability during the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2005 and therefore no further impact on the balance sheet as at 1 January 2005. b Fair value of freehold property as deemed cost consolidated balance sheet only Principal difference Under the transitional rules of IFRS 1 the fair value of items of property, plant and equipment can be used as the deemed cost at the date of transition.
Transition impact The freehold property has been included in the transition balance sheet at its deemed cost of 1,020,000.
This has resulted in an increase to non-current assets and to retained earnings of 747,000.
In accordance with IAS 12 a provision for deferred tax is required in respect of the increased deemed cost which increases the deferred tax liability by 224,000.
The net impact on retained earnings is therefore an increase of 523,000, which is not distributable.
Impact as at 1 January 2005 The freehold property has been depreciated throughout the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2005.
At 1 January 2005 the balance sheet reflects the closing net book value of the asset of 986,000.
This has resulted in an increase in non-current assets and to retained earnings of 722,000.
The property was sold in the first half of 2005.
There is no movement in the deferred tax liability during the year in respect of this asset.
c Employee benefits Principal difference Under UK GAAP, any liability asset on the balance sheet represented the timing difference between the SSAP 24 charge and the payments made to the pension scheme.
Under IFRS, the liability asset on the balance sheet represents the deficit surplus on the defined benefit pension scheme.
Transition impact A pension scheme liability of 11,347,000 has been recognised at the transition date.
There is a corresponding positive deferred tax adjustment of 3,404,000 resulting from this recognition.
The net effect is a reduction of shareholders funds of 7,943,000 on transition.
Impact as at 1 January 2005 Throughout the year all movements in the deficit on the pension scheme are recognised against the liability.
At 1 January 2005 the liability on the balance sheet reflects the closing deficit of the pension scheme.
This has been adjusted to reflect the actuarial loss for the year of 903,000 that has been recognised directly in reserves.
The movement in the deferred tax asset arising from this liability was an 88,000 decrease.
d Share-based payments Principal difference Under UK GAAP no liability was recognised in respect of share awards as for the executive share options the intrinsic value was nil and the SAYE scheme was exempt under UITF 17.
Under IFRS 2, as all of the share awards are equity settled, the balance sheet entry, based on the fair value of the awards is a credit direct to equity reserves.
Transition impact A deferred tax asset of 25,000 has been recognised on transition at 28 December 2003.
Impact as at 1 January 2005 The deferred tax asset has been increased by 145,000 as at 1 January 2005. e Dividends Principal difference Under UK GAAP, the practice is to recognise dividends in the year to which they relate, whereas under IFRS the dividend is recognised in the year in which it is declared.
As a result, the dividend creditor is not recognised until the dividend is declared and therefore at each year end needs to be adjusted accordingly.
Transition impact As the 2003 interim dividend had been paid and the 2003 final dividend had not been declared at 28 December 2003, there is no dividend creditor in the transition balance sheet.
The opening creditor of 6,457,000 has been reversed.
Impact as at 1 January 2005 At the year end the 2004 interim dividend had been paid and the final dividend had not been declared.
The closing dividend creditor of 7,922,000 under UK GAAP has been reversed.
Group cashflow statement For the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2005 The move from UK GAAP to IFRS does not change the cashflow of the Group.
The IFRS cashflow statement is similar to UK GAAP but presents various cashflows in different categories and in a different order from the UK GAAP cashflow statement.
Parent company cashflow statement For the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2005 Under UK GAAP, the parent company was not required to, and did not, prepare a cashflow statement.
