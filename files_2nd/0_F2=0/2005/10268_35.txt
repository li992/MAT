ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 19.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS As set out in the accounting policies, the Group has adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005.
Comparative financial information has been prepared under UK GAAP, FRS 13.
The primary objectives of the treasury function are to provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the Group and to identify and manage financial risks, including exposure to movements in interest and foreign exchange rates arising from those activities.
If appropriate, the Group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks, as set out below.
Credit risk Exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis, credit checks being performed on all clients requiring credit over certain amounts.
Credit is not extended beyond authorised limits, established where appropriate through reference with a professional credit vetting organisation.
Credit granted is subject to regular review, to ensure it remains consistent with the clients current creditworthiness and appropriate to the anticipated volume of business.
Investments are allowed only in liquid short term instruments within approved limits, with investment counterparties approved by the Board.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset in the balance sheet, these being spread across the various currencies and jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Interest rate risk The Group adopts a policy of ongoing review of its exposure to changes in interest rates on its borrowings, taking into account market expectations with regard to the perceived level of risk associated with each currency, the maturity pro le and cash ows of the underlying debt, and the extent to which debt may potentially be either prepaid prior to its maturity or re nanced at reduced cost.
The Groups policy is to maintain a mixture of its financial liabilities on xed and oating-rate bases.
Interest rate derivatives may be used to manage interest rate risk.
The Group actively monitors the need and timing for such derivatives.
Interest rate derivatives are classi ed as cash ow hedges, and are stated at fair value within the Groups balance sheet.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on revenue, purchases, borrowings and cash deposits denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, Singapore dollars, New Zealand dollars, Australian dollars, New Taiwan dollars and Korean won.
The Groups principal policy wherever possible is to maintain a natural hedge whereby liabilities are matched with assets denominated in the same currency.
Foreign currency investment exposure is also reduced by borrowing in the currency of investment.
To mitigate foreign currency translation exposure, an appropriate proportion of net assets is designated as hedged against corresponding financial liabilities in the same currency.
Exchange differences arising on foreign currency loans during each accounting period are recognised as a component of equity, to the extent that the hedge is effective.
The foreign exchange exposure arising on the Groups net investment in its subsidiaries is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the exposure arising on the Groups foreign currency borrowings.
Foreign currency transaction exposure is primarily managed through funding of purchases from operating income streams arising in the same currency.
Hedging of transaction exposure may be undertaken with approved counterparties and within designated limits, using spot or short term forward contracts to buy or sell the currency concerned, once the timing and the underlying amount of exposure have been determined.
Foreign exchange derivatives may also be used to hedge speci c transaction exposure where appropriate.

Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or discounted using the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
For interest rate swaps bank valuations are used.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash ows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash ows, discounted at market interest rates for similiar lease agreements.
The estimated fair values re ect change in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to re ect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
Interest rates used for determining fair value Prevailing market interest rates are used to discount cash ows to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
