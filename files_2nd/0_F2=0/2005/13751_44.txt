All other amounts included above are unlisted investments.
The gross cost of total other xed asset investments as at 31 March 2005 was US$193 million 2004: US$290 million.
The sale of the groups 29.4% interest in Harbin was completed in June 2004 realising a profit of US$103 million, after taking into account all associated costs.
The net effect of this disposal reduced the carrying value of xed asset investments by US$103 million.
In July 2004 the group disposed of its entire 21% interest in Edcon realising a pre-tax profit of US$252 million.
The disposal had no effect on the carrying value of other xed asset investments.
The groups assets and liabilities in subsidiaries in India were reclassied as other xed asset investments in 2004, following the establishment of a 50:50 joint venture with Shaw Wallace and Company Ltd Shaw Wallace.
As at 31 March 2004 and as at 31 March 2005, certain legal issues in India relating to the ownership of the joint venture were still being resolved and there was uncertainty over the satisfactory completion of the transaction.
Until resolution of these issues, the investment has been accounted for as a xed asset investment as the group was not certain that it would obtain the benets of its participation in the joint venture.
The carrying value of the investment as at 31 March 2005 amounted to US$142 million 2004: US$142 million.
As discussed in note 37, on 27 May 2005, the group acquired the Shaw Wallace Groups interest in the brewing operations taking the groups interest in the brewing operations to 99%.
The group considers that this second transaction has been structured in such a way as to satisfactorily mitigate the issues relating to the ownership structure referred to above.
