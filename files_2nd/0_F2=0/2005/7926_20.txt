IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 100 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 29 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP continued i Pensions Under UK GAAP, pension costs are accounted for under the rules set out in Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
Its objectives and principles are broadly in line with those set out in the US accounting standard for pensions, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
87, Employers Accounting for Pensions SFAS 87.
However, SSAP 24 is less prescriptive in the application of the actuarial method and assumptions to be applied in the calculation of pension costs.
Under US GAAP, the annual pension cost comprises the estimated cost of benefits accruing in the period as determined in accordance with SFAS 87.
Under SFAS 87, a pension asset representing the excess of Scheme assets over benefit obligations has been recognised in the balance sheet.
ii Business combinations Both UK and US GAAP require purchase consideration relating to a business combination to be allocated to the net assets acquired at their fair value on the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets Under UK GAAP fair values are assigned to identifiable intangible assets only if the identifiable intangibles are capable of being disposed of or settled separately, without disposing of a business of the entity.
Under US GAAP, identifiable assets are separately valued and amortised over their useful lives.
The separately identifiable intangible assets included in the US GAAP balance sheet are principally comprised of brand rights, which are being amortised over periods between 25 to 30 years.
Goodwill amortisation Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising and separately identifiable and separable intangible assets acquired on acquisitions made on or after 27 September 1998 are capitalised and amortised over their useful life, not exceeding a period of 20 years.
Prior to 27 September 1998, all goodwill and separately identifiable and separable intangible assets were written off to reserves on acquisition.
The Company adopted SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142 with effect from 1 July 2001 and accordingly goodwill arising on acquisitions after this date are not amortised.
For purchase transactions prior to 1 July 2001, goodwill was capitalised and amortised over its useful life.
From 29 September 2002, in accordance with SFAS 142, the Company no longer amortises goodwill but rather tests such assets for impairment on an annual basis or where there is an indicator of impairment.
The Company completed an annual impairment review under SFAS 142 at 30 September 2005 and no impairment of goodwill was indicated.
For the purposes of the annual impairment review, goodwill has been allocated to the following reporting units of the Group: Manufacturing, UK Sales and Marketing and International Sales and Marketing.
