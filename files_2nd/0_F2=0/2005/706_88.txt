120 Alliance UniChem Plc Notes to the Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 I DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivative financial instruments utilised by the Company include interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, interest rate caps and forward exchange contracts.
These derivative financial instruments are used to manage the foreign currency and interest rate risk of the Companys and Groups borrowings and investments.
Derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Derivatives are measured at fair value.
The accounting treatment in the Company is determined by the type of hedge relationship adopted.
Currently the only derivative financial instruments which are designated as within a hedge relationship for the Company are fair value hedges.
Gains and losses on these derivative instruments are recognised in the income statement and the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect movements associated with the hedged risks where the relationship is assessed to be effective.
Where the hedge relationship falls outside the permitted range of 80% to 125%, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account and the underlying hedged item is recognised at amortised cost with no adjustment to the carrying value permitted.
Those derivatives which are not designated as hedges are classified as held-for-trading and gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Loans held by the Company are measured at amortised cost except where the underlying transaction is designated within an effective fair value hedge relationship.
In these cases the carrying value is adjusted to reflect movements associated with the hedged risks.
