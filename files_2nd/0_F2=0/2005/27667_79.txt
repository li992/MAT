By order of the Board Registered Office: 5th Floor Martin C Murray Old Mutual Place Group Company Secretary 2 Lambeth Hill 27 February 2006 London EC4V 4GG Notes: 1 A member of the Company entitled to attend and vote at the meeting may appoint a proxy ies to attend and, on a poll, vote on his or her behalf.
A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
A member who holds shares through Old Mutual Nominees may instruct the nominee company to vote on his or her behalf or request such nominee company to appoint him or her as proxy to enable him or her to attend the meeting in person Old Mutual Nominees is Old Mutual South Africa Nominees Pty Limited, Old Mutual Namibia Nominees Pty Limited, Old Mutual Zimbabwe Nominees Private Limited or Old Mutual Blantyre Nominees Limited, if shares are held through the Groups nominee on the South African, Namibian, Zimbabwe or Malawi register respectively.
Beneficial shareholders who have dematerialised or immobilised their shareholdings in STRATE other than through Old Mutual Nominees may provide their CSDP or broker with voting instructions in accordance with the applicable custody agreement or may apply to that CSDP or broker for a letter of representation from the registered shareholder to enable them to attend the meeting in person.
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies for the meeting and any adjournment s of the meeting may do so by using the procedures in the CREST manual.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message a CREST Proxy Instruction must be properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCos specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST manual.
CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider s, should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider s, who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
Old Mutual plc 222 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Beneficial holders of shares through the Swedish nominee, VPC AB, may provide VPC with voting instructions or may apply for a letter of representation from the registered shareholder to enable them to attend the meeting in person.
The Company has appointed WM-data of Box 47104, 100 74 Stockholm as its proxy handling agent in Sweden for the purpose of the meeting.
2 Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the Company gives notice that only those shareholders entered on the register of members of the Company at 6.00 p. m. UK time on 8 May 2006 will be entitled to attend and to vote at the Annual General Meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time.
Changes to the entries on the register after that time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
3 To be effective, the form of proxy or, as the case may be, the voting instruction form and any power of attorney or other authority under which it is signed, or a notarially certified copy of such power or authority, must be received at the return address specified on the envelope enclosed with the form of proxy or voting instruction form or by the Companys Registrar, Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol BS99 7NH by not later than 11.00 a. m. UK time on 8 May 2006.
If no return envelope is enclosed with the voting instruction form, this will be because the records available to the Company show your shareholding to have been dematerialised in the context of STRATE through a CSDP or broker other than under the Issuer-Sponsored Nominee Programme.
In that case, you should contact your CSDP or broker to ascertain the return address for it to process your voting instructions.
It is recommended that, because of the requirement for votes in relation to shares dematerialised or immobilised in the context of STRATE to be collated through CSDPs and brokers and then reconciled through PLC Nominees Pty Limited, voting instructions by beneficial owners of such shares be submitted so as to arrive at least 72 hours before the time of the meeting.
For beneficial shareholders who hold their shares through the Swedish nominee, VPC AB, it is recommended that you submit your voting instructions to WM-data so as to arrive by close of business on 5 May 2006 in order to assist matching of records with data on underlying beneficial shareholdings.
The message appointing or instructing a proxy making use of the CREST service must be transmitted so as to be received by Computershare ID 3RA50 not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for the meeting.
For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST applications host from which the issuers agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST.
No messages received through the CREST network after this time will be accepted.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that CRESTCo does not make available any special procedures in CREST for any particular messages.
Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions.
It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider s, to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider s take s such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time.
In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35 5 a of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
4 The completion and return of a form of proxy or voting instruction form will not preclude a member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting from doing so if he or she wishes.

Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 223 Notice of Annual General Meeting continued Annual General Meeting Explanatory notes Annual General Meeting 2006 There are a number of items of special business included in the agenda for our AGM.
The directors recommend that you vote in favour of all of the items of business at the AGM, as they intend to do in respect of their personal shareholdings in the Company.
These explanatory notes provide further details of these matters.
Resolution 2 Dividend A final dividend of 3.65p per Ordinary Share is being recommended by the Board.
Subject to the dividend being approved at the Annual General Meeting, it is expected that the relevant subsidiaries of the Company will declare to the trustees of the dividend access trusts, which have been established in each of South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Malawi, an equivalent amount of dividend in relation to the estimated number of shares on those territories respective registers in the respective local currencies of those territories by reference to the exchange rate prevailing at the close of business on 28 March 2006, as determined by the Company.
Shareholders on the branch registers or, in the case of Namibia, the relevant section of the principal register in those territories will then receive their dividend, in accordance with the provisions of the Companys Articles of Association, from the dividend access trust concerned, rather than from the Company.
In relation to shareholders who hold their shares in the Company through the Swedish nominee, VPC AB.
The Kronor equivalent of the Sterling dividend will also be fixed by reference to the exchange rate prevailing at the close of business on 28 March 2006, as determined by the Company.
The equivalent amounts of the recommended dividend in each of the five other currencies will be notified by the Company to each of the stock exchanges on which the Companys shares are listed on 29 March 2006.
Resolutions 3 i to iv Election and re-election of directors Mr Khoza, who has been appointed as a director since the last Annual General Meeting, automatically retires in accordance with Article 94 of the Companys Articles of Association and will seek election at the meeting.
Mr Andrews, Mr Bogni and Mr Broadhurst retire by rotation in accordance with Articles 95 and 96 of the Companys Articles of Association and will seek re-election at the meeting.
Mr Clewlow retires at the Annual General Meeting and will not seek re-election.
Biographical details of each of the directors who is standing for election or re-election accompany their photographs on pages 44 and 45 of this Report.
Each of the retiring non-executive directors other than Mr Khoza is considered by the Board to be independent in character and free from any business or other relationship which could interfere with the exercise of his objective, unfettered and independent judgement.
The Nomination Committee of the Company has also conducted an assessment of the performance of each of the retiring candidates and has reviewed the skills, knowledge, experience and diversity represented on the Board.
Having received the results of that assessment and review, the Board recommends to shareholders the election or re-election of each of the retiring directors referred to in Resolutions 3 i to iv.
The election or re-election of directors is considered a significant matter, and approval of the election and re-elections will therefore be carried out by separate ordinary resolutions.
Subject to his being elected, Mr Khozas appointment is expected to last for an initial term of three years from his date of appointment i. e. until 26 January 2009 and will then be considered for renewal.
Details of Mr Andrews, Mr Bognis and Mr Broadhursts engagement terms are contained in the Remuneration Report.
Resolutions 4 and 5 Auditors KPMG Audit Plc has indicated its willingness to continue in office and Resolution 4 proposes the re-appointment of that firm as the Companys auditors.
Resolution 5 proposes that the Audit Committee be authorised to determine the auditors remuneration.
Resolution 6 Approval of the Remuneration Report In accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, an advisory resolution will be proposed to approve the Remuneration Report on pages 60 to 68 of the Annual Report.
A Summary of the Remuneration Report is also contained in the Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements.
The Remuneration Report includes details of the members of the Remuneration Committee and the Companys policy on directors remuneration, and reports on the remuneration arrangements in place for the executive directors and non-executive directors.
The full version of the Remuneration Report can also be accessed on the Companys website.
Resolution 6 is of an advisory nature only, and failure to pass the Resolution will therefore not have any legal consequences relating to existing arrangements.
However, the Board will take into consideration the outcome of the vote when considering the Companys remuneration policy.
Old Mutual plc 224 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Resolutions 7 and 8 Authority to allot shares In accordance with section 80 of the UK Companies Act 1985 the Companies Act, it is proposed to renew the authority for the directors to allot relevant securities up to an amount not exceeding 10% rounded down to the nearest 1,000 nominal of the current issued ordinary share capital at 24 February 2006 without having to obtain prior approval from shareholders.
This authority would be in addition to the transactionspecific authority to allot relevant securities in connection with the acquisition of Skandia granted by shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 14 November 2005, insofar as that authority has not yet been exhausted.
In accordance with section 95 of the Companies Act, it is proposed to renew the authority of the directors to allot equity securities for cash without first being required to offer such securities pro rata to existing shareholders in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act.
This authority relates to up to 267,810,000 ordinary shares, being 5% rounded down to the nearest 1,000 nominal of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company at 24 February 2006.
Resolutions 9 and 10 Purchase of own shares We are proposing that the existing authorities for the Company to buy back its shares be renewed at the AGM for a further year, including an extension of these powers to the Stockholm Stock Exchange, where we are now also listed.
The equivalent authorities were not activated during 2005, and we have no immediate plans to use them in the forthcoming year, but they do provide the Company with desirable flexibility in its capital management.
There are two contingent purchase contracts for buy-backs on the JSE this year, with Deutsche Securities joining Merrill Lynch South Africa as a potential counterparty.
There are also two separate contracts, with Merrill Lynch International and Deutsche Securities respectively, relating to buy-backs on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.
As this year there are a total of seven such contracts, all of which collectively are intended simply to enable the Company to buy back its shares on other exchanges in similar fashion and subject to the same overall limit on quantum as on-market purchases on the London Stock Exchange, they will be covered by means of a single, composite resolution, rather than by seven separate resolutions.
The authorities sought are subject to a limit of 10% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital at 24 February 2006 rounded down to the nearest 1,000 nominal.
The purchase price for any shares cannot be more than 5% above the average of the middle market quotations taken from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business days preceding such purchase translated, for the purposes of any purchases under any of the contingent purchase contracts described in Resolution 10, into the applicable local currency.
Any shares purchased under the authority granted by Resolution 9 or pursuant to any of the contingent purchase contracts to be approved under Resolution 10 will either be cancelled or may be held as treasury shares see the following paragraph.
In accordance with the Companies Acquisition of Own Shares Treasury Shares Regulations 2003, companies may now retain any of their own shares that they have purchased as treasury stock with a view to possible re-issue at a future date, rather than cancelling them.
If the Company were to purchase any of its own shares pursuant to the authorities sought in Resolutions 9 and 10, it would consider holding them as treasury stock, provided that the number did not at any one time exceed 10% of Old Mutual plcs issued share capital.
This would give the Company the ability to re-issue treasury shares quickly and cost-effectively, and would provide the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base.
The authorities under Resolutions 9 and 10, if approved, will only be exercised if market conditions make it advantageous for the Company to do so and the Board considers this to be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
