The principal differences are set out below.
Goodwill and intangible assets Under IFRSs transitional rules, purchased goodwill and identiable intangible assets are recognised at the transition date to IFRSs at deemed cost.
For goodwill, the deemed cost at 1 January 2004 was the carrying value under previous GAAP at 31 December 2003.
Under previous GAAP, goodwill arising from acquisitions after 1 January 1998 was capitalised and amortised over the period of its expected useful life, up to a maximum of 20 years.
For intangible assets with indefinite lives, the deemed cost at the date of transition to IFRSs is the original cost at which these costs were initially recognised on the balance sheet.
Under US GAAP prior to 1 January 2002, purchased goodwill and identiable intangible assets were capitalised and amortised over their useful lives.
From 1 January 2002, under FAS 142, the amortisation of goodwill and identiable intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives ceased.
Intangible assets that have nite useful lives continue to be amortised over their useful lives for both IFRSs and US GAAP.
The differences between IFRSs and US GAAP on accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are set out in the tables and footnotes below.
Impact of goodwill and intangible assets differences on equity: million million 2005 2004 a Pre-1998 goodwill and intangible assets 3 536 3 617 b Cessation of goodwill amortisation 1 631 1 502 b Cessation of intangible assets amortisation 329 250 c Differences in calculation of goodwill on acquisition 1 198 1 041 d Recognised impairments on goodwill and intangible assets 128 131 b Cessation of goodwill amortisation on joint ventures and associates 25 21 Total adjustment to equity 5 933 5 800 a Under previous GAAP, goodwill and intangible assets purchased prior to 1 January 1998 were written off in the year of acquisition as a movement in profits retained.
Under US GAAP, such goodwill and intangible assets were capitalised and, prior to 1 January 2002, were amortised over their useful lives.
These different accounting treatments gave rise to differences in the calculation of equity under IFRSs and US GAAP.
Similar differences arise between net profit or loss on disposal of a business or intangible asset under US GAAP.
b Under US GAAP prior to 1 January 2002, purchased goodwill and identiable intangible assets were capitalised and amortised over their useful lives.
Intangible assets that have nite useful lives continue to be amortised over their useful lives.
c The detailed rules for determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as part of the acquisition of a business differed between previous GAAP and US GAAP.
We have applied the exemption in IFRS 1 relating to business combinations and therefore the carrying value under previous GAAP for goodwill as at 31 December 2003 is its deemed cost at the date of transition to IFRSs see also note 35 on pages 144 to 151.
These, previous differences therefore give rise to differing gures for goodwill arising on acquisition as calculated under IFRSs and US GAAP.
d As more fully disclosed below, the carrying values of goodwill and identiable intangible assets and the detailed rules for measuring and allocating an impairment loss differ between IFRSs and US GAAP, resulting in divergences for impairment charges recognised.
Under US GAAP the carrying values and detailed rules for measuring and allocating an impairment loss differ from those under IFRS.
As a result, for the year ended 31 December 2005, the evaluation of the Slim Fast trademark resulted in an impairment charge under US GAAP of 343 million, 104 million more than the charge recognised in respect of the trademark under IFRSs and 20 million less than the total impairment charge recognised under IFRSs for the Slim Fast business.
For US GAAP purposes, the fair value of the trademark asset was determined using a relief-from-royalty method that estimates the value of the implied royalty stream that could be generated from the trademark, were it to be licensed.
There are a number of goodwill and intangible assets being carried for US GAAP purposes for which no corresponding value exists under IFRSs.
The annual impairment testing conducted in 2005 identied certain goodwill and intangible assets for which the carrying value was no longer fully recoverable.
Accordingly, an impairment charge was recognised solely for US GAAP purposes in respect of the following: As a result of the global use of the Unilever brand on all product packaging we have discontinued the use of the Faberg trade name resulting in an impairment charge of 120 million: and The 2005 review of our ice cream operations in Latin America indicated that an impairment charge of 66 million was required.
In each of the above, fair value was determined by use of a relief-from-royalty valuation method for indefinite-lived trademarks and through a present value of discounted cash ows methodology for the relevant reporting unit in respect of goodwill.
Other goodwill impairment charges recognised in 2005 include 98 million of write-downs in respect of planned business disposals in The Americas region that will complete during 2006.

Restructuring costs Under Unilevers accounting policy, certain restructuring costs relating to employee terminations are recognised when a restructuring plan has been announced.
Under US GAAP, liabilities relating to exit costs are recognised when incurred.
Employee termination costs are generally considered to be incurred when the company has a liability to the employee, unless further service is required from the employee, in which case costs are recognised as benets are earned.
Provisions related to excess lease costs for onerous contracts are reduced by assumed sub-lease income for the periods impacted.
Biological assets In accordance with IAS 41, biological assets are re-measured at fair value less estimated point-of-sale costs at each reporting period.
Under US GAAP these assets are measured at historical cost and depreciated over their useful life.
Interest Unilever treats all interest costs as a charge to the income statement in the current period.
Under US GAAP, interest incurred during the construction periods of tangible xed assets is capitalised and depreciated over the life of the assets.
Sale and leaseback The test for determining if an asset qualies for treatment as a sale in a sale and leaseback transaction is stricter under US GAAP than that under IFRSs, in particular where the lessee has continuing involvement.
As a result, a sale and leaseback transaction entered into by Unilever was treated as a sale and operating lease of land and nancing lease of a building under IFRSs but as a nancing obligation for US GAAP.
Accordingly, under US GAAP the gain on sale of 37 million was reversed in the income statement, the property was reinstated and a nancing obligation of 114 million equivalent to the proceeds received for the sale was recognised.
The lease for this transaction is payable from 30 March 2007 until the lease expiry date of 29 September 2027.
Future commitments for the lease attached to this transaction are: million The commitments fall due as follows: Within 1 year After 1 year but within 2 years 15 After 2 years but within 3 years 15 After 3 years but within 4 years 15 After 4 years but within 5 years 15 After 5 years 312 Future minimum lease payments 372 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2005 159 Financial Statements Additional information for US investors continued Unilever Group Financial Instruments Under the rules governing the transition to IFRSs, Unilever has adopted IAS 32 39 on financial instruments from 1 January 2005.
Unilevers accounting policies in respect of derivative financial instruments under IFRSs are described in note 1 on page 83.
There are minor differences between these and the application of US GAAP from 1 January 2005.
In particular, from 1 January 2005, Unilever recognises all derivative financial instruments on balance sheet at fair value and applies hedge accounting to a portion of its portfolio of derivative financial instruments, meaning that changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash ows are recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Prior to the adoption of IAS 32 39 on 1 January 2005, Unilever applied hedge accounting to its portfolio of derivative financial instruments, meaning that changes in the value of forward exchange contracts were recognised in the results in the same period as changes in the values of the assets and liabilities they were intended to hedge.
Interest payments and receipts arising from interest rate derivatives such as swaps and forward rate agreements were matched to those arising from underlying debt and investment positions.
Payments made or received in respect of the early termination of derivative instruments were spread over the original life of the instrument so long as the underlying exposure continues to exist.
Prior to 1 January 2005, Unilever had not designated any of its derivative financial instruments as qualifying hedge instruments under US FAS 133 and accordingly, under US GAAP, all derivative financial instruments were valued at fair value with changes in fair value reected in the income statement.
Investments The adoption of IAS 32 39 eliminates any previous divergence between Unilevers accounting for non-derivative financial instruments and US GAAP.
A divergence therefore only exists in the 2004 comparative gures.
Prior to 1 January 2005 Unilever accounted for changes in the market value of current investments as interest receivable in the income statement for the year.
Non-current investments, other than interests in joint ventures and associates, are stated at cost less any amounts written off to reect a permanent impairment.
Under US GAAP, such current asset investments are generally classied as available for sale securities and changes in market values, which represent unrealised gains or losses, are excluded from earnings and taken to stockholders equity unless such losses are deemed to be other than temporary at which time they are recognised through the income statement.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the market values of securities available for sale are not material at 31 December 2004.
Preference shares Under IAS 32, Unilever recognises preference shares that provide a xed preference dividend as borrowings with preference dividends recognised in the income statement.
Under US GAAP such preference shares are classied in shareholders equity with dividends treated as a deduction to shareholders equity.
Pensions Under IAS 19, the expected costs of providing retirement benets are charged to the income statement over the periods benefiting from the employees services.
Variations from the expected cost are recognised as they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The assets and liabilities of pension plans are included in the Group balance sheet at fair value.
Under US GAAP, pensions costs and liabilities are accounted for in accordance with the prescribed actuarial method and measurement principles of FAS 87.
The most significant difference is that variations from the expected costs are recognised in the income statement over the expected service lives of the employees.
Under US GAAP, an additional minimum liability is recognised and a charge made to other comprehensive income when the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets to the extent that this amount is not covered by the net liability recognised in the balance sheet.
Deferred tax Under IFRSs, a provision is made on unremitted earnings of controlled group companies to the extent that the distributions are considered probable.
US GAAP requires full provision to be made assuming all earnings will be distributed, unless those earnings can be recovered tax-free or will be permanently reinvested in the controlled group company.
Under IFRSs, deferred tax on share-based compensation is provided based on the actual tax credit expected to be received using the fair market value of the share price at the year end the intrinsic value.
The deferred tax is credited to the income statement to the extent of the tax recognised on the share-based compensation charge with the excess recognised directly in equity.
Under US GAAP, deferred tax on the sharebased awards that ordinarily result in future tax deductions is recognised to the extent of the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognised through the income statement.
Tax deductions inherent in the current fair value of the entitys stock are not taken into account.
profit or loss on disposal of businesses Under both IFRSs and US GAAP, Unilever calculates profit or loss on sale of businesses net of goodwill included on the balance sheet and after the write-back of cumulative currency retranslation differences.
Under previous GAAP, goodwill and intangible assets purchased prior to 1 January 1998 were written off in the year of acquisition as a movement in profits retained.
These different accounting treatments give rise to differences between net profit or loss calculated under IFRSs and that calculated under US GAAP.
The additional goodwill and intangibles recorded under US GAAP for our UCI business means that the US GAAP profit on disposal of this business is 217 million lower than that reported under IFRSs.
Under IFRSs, cumulative currency retranslation differences arising from the transition date to IFRSs of 1 January 2004 are included in the calculation whereas under US GAAP the profit or loss on disposal includes cumulative currency retranslation differences which have arisen since the date that the businesses were originally acquired.
Currency Recycling Under IFRSs, the gain from cumulative translation differences arising from the partial repayment of capital of a subsidiary is recognised within the income statement.
Under US GAAP, currency translation gains and losses are only recycled to the income statement on the sale or upon the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the investment.
160 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Additional information for US investors continued Unilever Group Classication differences between IFRSs and US GAAP Cash ow statement Under US GAAP, various items would be reclassied within the consolidated cash ow statement.
In particular, interest received and interest paid would be part of net cash ow from operating activities.
In addition, under US GAAP, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and cash equivalents with an original maturity at the date of investment of less than three months.
Under Unilevers presentation, cash and cash equivalents are net of bank overdrafts.
Cash ows from movements in bank overdrafts would be classied as part of cash ows from nancing activities under US GAAP.
Cash ows from movements in bank overdrafts were 61 million for the year ended 31 December 2005 2004: 134 million.
Recent accounting developments In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB Statement No.
151 Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB 43 FAS151.
The standard claries that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials spoilage should be recognised as current-period charges.
In addition, FAS 151 requires that the allocation of xed production overheads to inventory values be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.
The provisions of FAS 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during reporting periods beginning after 15 June 2005.
FAS 151 does not have an impact on the results of operations or financial position of Unilever since the key elements are already applied in Unilevers financial statements.
In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision of FASB Statement No.
123 Share-Based Payments FAS 123 R which also supersedes APB Opinion No.
25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Generally the valuation methods contained in FAS 123 R are similar to those in FAS 123, but FAS 123 R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee share options, to be charged to the statement of income.
Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.
With limited exceptions, the amount charged to the statement of income for share options will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the option amortised over the period to the date of vesting of the award.
FAS 123 R is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after 15 June 2005.
The company is currently evaluating the provisions of this Statement.
The adoption of FAS 123 R is not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial position of Unilever as Unilever adopted the fair value measurement provisions of FAS 123 in 2003.
In March 2005 the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No.
47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations FIN 47, which claries the term conditional asset retirement obligation used in FAS 143.
Unilever will apply the standard to the financial year beginning on 1 January 2006: this is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial position of Unilever.
In May 2005 the FASB issued FASB Statement No.
154 Accounting changes and error corrections FAS 154 as a replacement of APB Opinion No.
20 Accounting changes and FASB Statement No.
3 Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, which has to be applied for financial years beginning on or after 15 December 2005.
It requires retrospective application, and Unilever will apply the standard to the financial year beginning on 1 January 2006.
The adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position of Unilever.
