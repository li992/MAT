Stagecoach Group plc page 35 Notes to the accounts Note 1 Statement of accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below.
All principal accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
a Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
b Presentation of profit and loss account Where applicable, profit and loss account information has been presented in a columnar format, which separately highlights goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
This is intended to enable the users of the accounts to determine more readily the impact of goodwill and exceptional items on the results of the Group.
c Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates made up to 30 April in each year except as noted below: Associates The Groups share of the profit of Road King Infrastructure Limited pre-disposal is based on the results of that company for the year to 31 December.
The Groups share of the profit loss of other associates is based on the results for the period covered by the Groups financial year.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the results of businesses purchased from the effective date of acquisition and excludes the results of discontinued operations and businesses sold from the effective date of disposal.
No profit and loss account is presented for the parent company, Stagecoach Group plc, as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. d Intangible assets In accordance with FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, goodwill arising on acquisitions after 30 April 1998 is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet at cost less amortisation.
Each acquisition is reviewed and where the goodwill has a finite economic life, goodwill is amortised over that life.
In estimating the useful economic life of goodwill, account has been taken of the nature of the business acquired, stability of the industry sector, extent of barriers to entry and expected future impact of competition.
The useful life of goodwill arising on the acquisitions made is estimated by the directors to be between 2 and 20 years.
Provision is made for any impairment, with impairment reviews being undertaken in accordance with FRS 11, Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year ended 30 April 1998 and earlier periods was written off directly to reserves in accordance with the accounting standard then in force.
As permitted by the current accounting standard, the goodwill previously written off to reserves has not been reinstated in the balance sheet.
On the disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, goodwill previously written off directly to reserves in respect of such an undertaking is transferred to the profit and loss account and constitutes part of the gain or loss to the Group arising on disposal.
Fair value accounting adjustments have been made to take account of the revaluation of certain fixed assets on an existing use basis, discounting of long term liabilities but not deferred tax provisions and other changes in accounting policies required to comply with Group policies.
Fair value adjustments based on provisional estimates are amended in the following years accounts where necessary, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, in order to refine adjustments to reflect further evidence gained post-acquisition.
As explained in note 13 to the accounts, during the year ended 30 April 2005, the Directors revised the period over which goodwill in respect of the Groups interest in Virgin Rail Group is being amortised.
e Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are shown at their original historic cost or fair value on acquisition net of depreciation and any provision for impairment as set out in note 12.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation less estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Heritable and freehold buildings and long leasehold properties 50 years Short leasehold properties Over period of lease Public service vehicles PSVs and transportation equipment 7 to 16 years, depending on type Information Technology and other equipment, furniture and fittings 3 to 10 years Motor cars and other vehicles 3 to 5 years Heritable and freehold land is not depreciated.
The need for any fixed asset impairment write-down is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of the asset against the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
As part of the restructuring of the Groups North American business, the Directors reviewed the estimated residual values and estimated useful lives of public service vehicles operated in North America.
The effect of this change in estimate is to reduce profit before tax for the year ended 30 April 2005 by 2.7m.
f Pre-contract costs In accordance with UITF Abstract 34, Pre-contract costs, the costs associated with securing new rail franchises are expensed as incurred, except where it is virtually certain that a contract will be awarded in which case they are recognised as an asset and are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the franchise.
page 36 Stagecoach Group plc Note 1 Statement of accounting policies continued g Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
In the Companys accounts, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost, less provision for impairment.
h Associates and joint ventures In the Group accounts, the investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the Groups share of associates and joint ventures profits less losses, while the Groups share of associates and joint ventures net assets is shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
Where the Group has an interest in a joint ventures net liabilities, the Groups share of net liabilities is classified within provisions for liabilities and charges.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above.
Any unamortised goodwill is included in the carrying value of the Groups investments.
The Group applies its own accounting policies when accounting for its share of associates and joint ventures, making appropriate adjustments where necessary, having given due regard to all relevant factors.
i Stocks Stocks of parts and consumables are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for obsolete or slow moving items.
Taxicabs which are held for sale or leased to independent contractors are included within stocks.
j Hire purchase and lease obligations Assets acquired under hire purchase and finance leases are recorded in the balance sheet as assets at the equivalent of the purchase price and as obligations to pay hire purchase capital instalments or future lease rentals.
Obligations arising from hire purchase contracts and finance leases represent the total of the capital payments outstanding at the date of the balance sheet.
Future finance charges are not included.
Future finance charges are calculated in relation to the reducing balance of capital outstanding throughout the contract and charged to the profit and loss account on the same basis.
Assets capitalised under finance leases and other similar contracts are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their estimated useful lives.
Assets capitalised under hire purchase contracts are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The principal restriction on property held under finance or hire purchase agreements is a restriction on the right to dispose of the property during the period of the agreement.
k Taxation Corporation tax is provided on taxable profits at the current rate applicable.
Tax charges and credits are accounted for through the same primary statement either the profit and loss account or the statement of total recognised gains and losses as the related pre-tax item.
In accordance with FRS 19, Deferred Taxation, full provision is made for deferred tax on a non-discounted basis in respect of all timing differences except those arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no binding sale agreement and undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries and associates.
Deferred tax is calculated at rates at which it is estimated the tax will arise.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent they are more likely than not to be recovered.
l Turnover Turnover represents gross revenue earned from public transport services and operating lease rentals receivable, and excludes future payments received on account.
Amounts receivable for tendered services and concessionary fare schemes are included as part of turnover.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and VAT.
Revenues incidental to the Groups principal activity including advertising income and maintenance income are reported as miscellaneous revenue.
Bus and rail revenue is recognised at the time of travel.
Bus revenue from local authority and similar contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
Miscellaneous revenue comprises income from advertising and other activities and is recognised as the income is earned.
Net compensation receivable by UK Rail companies in respect of service disruption under the performance regime provisions of the track access agreements with Network Rail is recognised over the expected period of disruption and is shown as other operating income.
m Tokens Tokens issued by National Transport Tokens Limited, a subsidiary of the Group, are credited to a token redemption provision.
Redemptions are offset against this and associated handling commission paid to third parties is included in operating costs.
Funds from the sale of tokens required for token redemption are included as a financing activity in the consolidated cash flow statement.
The estimation of the balance sheet provision for token redemption is based on the value of tokens issued by the Group but not yet redeemed at the balance sheet date.
Allowance is made for the estimated proportion of tokens in issue that will never be redeemed.
This allowance is estimated with reference to historic redemption rates.
Stagecoach Group plc page 37 Notes to the accounts Note 1 Statement of accounting policies continued n Pension costs The Group provides for and funds pension liabilities on the advice of external actuaries and makes payments to segregated funds managed by specialist financial institutions.
Independent actuarial valuations on a going concern basis are carried out at least every three years.
The employer costs of providing retirement benefits to employees are charged to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis so as to produce a substantially level percentage of the current and future pensionable payroll.
Variations from regular cost arising from any excess or deficiency of the actuarial value of the pension funds assets over the actuarial valuation of the pension funds liabilities are allocated to the profit and loss account over the employees average remaining service lives.
Any timing difference between amounts charged in the profit and loss account and paid to the pension funds is shown in the balance sheet as an asset or a liability.
The Groups contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the period to which the contributions relate.
Details of the principal Group pension schemes are given in note 26e.
The transitional disclosures required under FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, are also included in note 26e.
o Foreign currencies The accounts of overseas subsidiaries and associate undertakings are maintained in the local currencies in which the subsidiaries transact business.
The trading results of overseas subsidiary and associate undertakings are translated into sterling using average rates of exchange.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of the opening net assets and results of overseas operations, together with exchange differences arising on net foreign currency borrowings and foreign currency derivatives, to the extent they hedge the Groups investment in overseas operations, are dealt with in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end except in those instances where the exchange rate risk of an asset or liability is hedged by a derivative, in which case the contract rate is used.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
PRINCIPAL RATES OF EXCHANGE 2005 2004 New Zealand Dollar Year end rate 2.6088 2.8350 Average rate 2.7240 2.7600 Hong Kong Dollar Year end rate 13.8317 Average rate 13.3188 Average rate Citybus 12.7803 US Dollar Year end rate 1.9099 1.7734 Average rate 1.8530 1.7115 Canadian Dollar Year end rate 2.3969 2.4388 Average rate 2.3621 2.2985 up to date of disposal p Accounting for finance costs and debt Finance costs of debt are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of such instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance costs that are recognised in the profit and loss account in respect of each accounting period.
The carrying amount is reduced by amounts paid in respect of finance costs and or repayments of principal.
q Government grants Government grants relating to tangible fixed assets are treated as deferred income and released to the profit and loss account over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Other grants are credited to the profit and loss account as the related expenditure is expensed.
Revenue grants receivable in respect of the operation of rail franchises in the UK are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year in which the related expenditure is recognised in the profit and loss account or where they do not relate to any specific expenditure, in the year in which the grant is receivable.
These rail franchise grants are classified within Other Operating Income.
page 38 Stagecoach Group plc Note 1 Statement of accounting policies continued r Derivatives and financial investments Financial assets other than derivatives are recognised in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk and interest rate movements.
The Group does not generally hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in currency rates and to hedge overseas net investments.
For a forward foreign exchange contract to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or to a probable commitment.
It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Group.
Gains and losses arising on these contracts are either held off balance sheet or deferred on balance sheet and recognised either in the profit and loss account or as adjustments to the carrying amount of fixed assets, only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in the Groups financial statements.
Gains and losses arising on derivatives hedging overseas net investments are recognised in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
For interest rate and commodity swaps to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or a probable commitment and must change the nature of the interest rate or fuel cost by converting a fixed rate to a variable rate or vice versa.
Cash flows under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable and fuel costs over the periods of the contracts.
Gains and losses arising from the termination of these contracts are deferred on balance sheet and amortised to the profit and loss account over the remaining period of the related hedged item or recognised immediately in the profit and loss account where the hedged item no longer exists.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position no longer exists or the hedge is no longer effective, provision is made for any fair value loss on the instrument at that time.
s Marketing costs Marketing costs incurred during the start up phase of a new activity are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
t Insurance The Group receives claims in respect of traffic incidents and employee claims.
The Group protects against the cost of such claims through third party insurance policies.
An element of the claims are not insured as a result of the excess on insurance policies.
Provision is made on a discounted basis for the estimated cost to the Group to settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date.
The estimation of the balance sheet insurance provisions is based on an assessment of the expected settlement on known claims together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date but that have not yet been reported to the Group.
The provision is set after taking account of advice from third party actuaries.
u Investment in own shares In accordance with UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts, own shares held by the Groups Employee Benefit Scheme and Qualifying Employee Share Trust have been classified as deductions from shareholders funds.

The operating profit from the discontinued element of North America is not separately shown because it is not clearly distinguishable due to certain shared costs that relate to North America as a whole.
However, the discontinued element of North Americas operating profit is not believed to be material in the context of the Groups annual operating profit as a whole, for neither the year ended 30 April 2005 nor the year ended 30 April 2004.

Payments are made to the SRA when performance is worse than the target benchmarks and conversely payments are received from the SRA when performance is better than that set by the benchmarks.
The year on year movement in these payments is primarily due to new benchmarks being set by the Regulator for Network Rail and is largely offset by payments to from Network Rail, which are included within operating costs.
Network Rail makes payments to our rail companies when punctuality deteriorates due to the actions of Network Rail and our rail companies make payments to Network Rail where the rail companies actions cause punctuality to deteriorate.

This has been presented to allow shareholders to gain a clearer understanding of the underlying performance.
On 10 September 2004, the Company issued 1,340,732,902 18 pence redeemable B shares at the rate of 1 redeemable B share for every 1 ordinary share held.
The issue of redeemable B shares was followed by a share consolidation whereby shareholders received 19 consolidated ordinary shares for every 24 ordinary shares held.
In determining the consolidated earnings per share, no adjustment has been made to the number of ordinary shares outstanding before the event where the issue of redeemable B shares was combined with the share consolidation.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the year ended 30 April 2005 has been adjusted for the reduction in the number of ordinary shares from the date on which the issue of redeemable B shares and share consolidation took place.
This treatment is consistent with paragraph 26 of Financial Reporting Standard 14, Earnings per Share.

The Virgin Rail Group Holdings shareholder agreement provides for joint decision making on key matters and equal representation on the Board.
As a consequence the investment has been accounted for as a joint venture.
As part of the original acquisition, the Group acquired a 20m shareholder loan to Virgin Rail Group Limited, now a subsidiary of Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited.
The shareholder loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 10% per annum.
10m of the original 20m loan was repaid on 28 April 2000, 3.3m was repaid on 23 September 2004, and a further 3.4m was repaid on 27 September 2004.
Unless otherwise agreed by its shareholders, Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited is restricted from paying dividends until any loans payable to its shareholders have been repaid.
With the agreement of its shareholders, Virgin Rail Group Holdings Limited has declared a dividend of 18m in respect of its financial year ended 5 March 2005.
This dividend was paid prior to 30 April 2005. page 48 Stagecoach Group plc Note 13 Fixed asset investments continued The Directors undertook an impairment review as at 30 April 2004 of the carrying value of the Groups 49% joint venture interest in Virgin Rail Group VRG and concluded that there had been no impairment loss.
For five years following the impairment review, the Group is required to review its initial projections in light of the actual cash flows.
The Group has therefore reviewed the projections made in connection with the 30 April 2004 impairment review.
This indicated that the actual net cash flows earned by the Group from its investment in VRG during the year ended 30 April 2005 exceeded those projected, therefore under this look-back test no impairment has arisen.
Both VRGs franchises operate on the basis of a Letter Agreement signed with the Strategic Rail Authority SRA in July 2002.
Negotiations will re-commence on the West Coast franchise in September 2005 with a view to agreeing revised commercial terms for the franchise through to 2012.
The SRA has terminated negotiations on the CrossCountry franchise and has the right to re-tender this franchise, although it is required to give at least 12 months notice to VRG if it intends to terminate the existing franchise.
Under the Letter Agreement, the SRA sets an annual budget, including the level of financial support, for each franchise.
The SRA has set challenging budgets for VRGs financial year to 4 March 2006.
In particular, discussions are continuing with the SRA regarding CrossCountrys requirement for additional cash funding from July 2005.
The Directors have re-assessed the carrying value of the Groups investment in VRG as at 30 April 2005.
In accordance with FRS 11, the Directors have compared the carrying value of our net investment in VRG, with its estimated recoverable amount, being the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
The value in use of VRG was determined using an average pre-tax discount rate of 10.7%.
The Directors of Stagecoach Group have concluded there is no impairment loss at 30 April 2005 and they continue to monitor the situation regularly and to assess any implications for the Groups investment in VRG.
The Directors reviewed the period over which the goodwill in respect of VRG was being amortised, in light of the status of negotiations on VRGs franchises and the possibility that the SRA could terminate the CrossCountry franchise with 12 months notice.
As a result, the amortisation of goodwill in respect of VRG has been accelerated, resulting in an increased charge of 14.7m 2004: 8.2m.
The remaining goodwill relating to the original acquisition of VRG is being amortised over its remaining useful life of 6.8 years from 30 April 2005.

The principal defined benefit occupational benefit schemes are as follows:.
The South West Trains section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS :.
The Island Line section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS :.
The Stagecoach Group Pension Scheme SGPS :.
A number of UK Local Government Pension Schemes LGPS.
These defined benefit schemes cover the majority of the Groups UK employees.
These schemes are devised in accordance with local employment terms and conditions.
Each scheme is administered independently of the employers and the scheme assets are held in trusts that are managed by investment managers appointed by the schemes trustees.
In addition, the Group contributes to a number of defined contribution schemes covering non-UK employees.
ii Accounting for pensions under SSAP 24 The Group has applied SSAP 24, Accounting for pension costs in preparing its accounts.
The total pension cost reported in the profit and loss account and the cash outflow to the Group in the year ended 30 April 2005 can be analysed as follows: Pension cost Cash outflow 2005 2004 2005 2004 m m m m UK Bus Group overheads SGPS 19.1 16.9 21.0 18.6 LGPS 7.0 3.4 3.1 3.6 Other 0.3 0.4 0.1 0.1 Rail RPS 11.6 11.3 13.2 13.0 North America 0.6 0.9 0.6 0.9 38.6 32.9 38.0 36.2 The balance sheet position of each scheme as at 30 April 2005 is analysed below.
It should be noted that the balance sheet position under SSAP 24 that is shown below is not equivalent to an actuarial estimate of the schemes funding position at the balance sheet date.
The net balance sheet asset of 26.1m 2004: 26.7m shown below is the sum of the cumulative differences between contributions paid by the employers into the schemes and the charge to the profit and loss account.

The key details for each scheme are as follows: Most recent full Latest actuarial Funding Market actuarial valuation review for Level value of of scheme SSAP 24 accounting % assets purposes m UK Bus Group overheads SGPS 5 April 2002 30 April 2002 105 325.9 LGPS 31 March 2004 30 April 2004 90 179.4 Rail RPS 31 December 2001 31 December 2001 105 225.5 The above defined benefit schemes are funded at contribution rates determined by independent actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the results of valuations are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increases in earnings and pensions.
The valuations referred to above for SSAP 24 accounting purposes assume that investment returns, net of management expenses, will exceed earnings growth by an average of at least 3.5% per annum.
Present and future pensions are assumed to increase at an average of 2.6% per annum for SGPS and 2.8% per annum for the other defined benefit schemes.
iii Accounting for pensions under FRS 17 Under the transitional arrangements for the implementation of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, the Group continues to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 as set out above.
The additional disclosures required by FRS 17 are provided below.
The calculations of FRS 17 disclosures have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations, which have been updated to 30 April 2005 by an independent professionally qualified actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17.
The main financial assumptions used by the actuary were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 %% % Rate of increase in salaries 4.3 4.3 4.0 Rate of increase of pensions in payment SGPS 2.6 2.6 2.3 Other defined benefit schemes 2.8 2.8 2.5 Discount rate 5.4 5.8 5.5 Inflation 2.8 2.8 2.5 Expected long-term rate of return as at 30 April were: Equities 8.5 8.5 8.5 Bonds 5.3 5.8 5.3 Cash 4.7 4.0 3.8 Property 7.5 7.5 8.0 includes private equity In applying FRS 17, the directors believe that the RPS schemes need to be considered separately.
The directors understand that the Group has no rights or obligations in respect of the RPS schemes following the expiry of the South West Trains and Island Line franchises.
Furthermore, the franchise payments of the South West Trains franchise to February 2007 take account of the cash cost of pension scheme funding during the franchise term.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that to best meet the requirements of IFRS and FRS 17, only that element of any deficit or surplus for each franchise that is expected to be funded or recovered during the period of the current franchise should be recognised as a liability or asset.
However, the FRS 17 disclosures have not yet been represented on that basis, and the Group is continuing to discuss how best to address this matter.
The amounts relating to the RPS schemes are separately highlighted on page 64.
