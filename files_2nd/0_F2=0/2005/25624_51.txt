UITF 31 confirmed that to the extent that the Group retains an ownership interest in the underlying business of Marot, that retained interest including any related pre-transaction goodwill, should be consolidated at its pre-transaction amount.
UITF 31 prohibited the Group from recognising its share of the fair value of Courcelles on its balance sheet.
As a consequence the Group was required to treat the cash receipt from this transaction as a distribution from Courcelles, which resulted in a negative carrying value for this investment.
FRS9 Associates and Joint Ventures required that this negative carrying value be regarded and presented as a liability even though no real liability existed.
Under IAS 28, if an investor's share of losses equals or exceeds the carrying amount of an investment, the investor ordinarily discontinues recognising their share of further losses.
The investment continues to be reported at nil value until such time as future profits exceed any unrecognised losses.
On adoption of IFRS the negative carrying value of Courcelles at the date of transition has been adjusted back to a nil value.
The value 99 at 31st December 2004 of this adjustment is 19,947k.
Given the nature of the transaction giving rise to the original negative value, under IFRS there are no unrecognised losses and consequently the Group is not prohibited from recognising its share of profits from this investment.
f Recognition of insurance broking debtors and creditors Insurance brokers act as agents in placing the insurable risks of their clients with insurers and, as such, are not liable as principals for amounts arising from such transactions.
Notwithstanding such legal relationships, debtors and creditors arising from insurance broking transactions have previously been shown as assets and liabilities in recognition of the fact that the insurance broker is entitled to retain investment income on any cash flows arising from such transactions.
This treatment has been reviewed in accordance with IFRS.
Arising from this review it was considered that insurance debtors in respect of premiums receivable do not represent an asset of the company and therefore should not be treated as an asset until the cash has been received.
Consequently the balance sheets at June and December 2004 have been restated to reflect only insurance cash received and the corresponding liability.
