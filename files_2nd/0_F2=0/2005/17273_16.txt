The Company mandates dividends through the BACS Bankers Automated Clearing Services system.
The benefit to shareholders of the BACS payment method is that the Registrar posts the tax vouchers directly to them, whilst the dividend is credited on the payment date to the shareholders bank or building society account.
Shareholders who have not yet arranged for dividends to be paid direct to their bank or building society account and wish to benefit from this service should request the Companys Registrar address overleaf to send them a Dividend Interest mandate form or alternatively complete the mandate form attached to any future dividend tax voucher.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan The Company provides a Dividend Reinvestment Plan enabling shareholders to apply their cash dividends to purchase additional ordinary shares in the market at competitive dealing rates.
Full details can be obtained from the Registrar.
If you have previously completed a mandate form to join the Plan, you need take no further action.
