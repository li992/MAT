Carillion plc Section 07 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Financial Statements 50 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Significant accounting policies Carillion plc the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom UK.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2005 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in jointly controlled entities.
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issuance on 8 March 2006. a Statement of compliance The Groups financial statements as approved by the Directors have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted for use in the EU.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
These are presented on pages 85 to 91.
An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has affected the reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Group was published on 30 June 2005 and is available on the Groups website at www.
These consolidated financial statements include reconciliations of total equity and profit or loss for the comparative period reported under UK GAAP previous GAAP to those reported under IFRS see note 35. b Basis of preparation The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments and financial instruments classified as available-for-sale.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has adopted IAS 32 Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation and IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement prospectively from 1 January 2005.
Consequently, comparative information for 2004 has been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
A reconciliation of total equity at 1 January 2005 following the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 is given in note 35.
As permitted by the standard, the Group has opted to adopt the requirements of IAS 19 revised 2004 Employee benefits early rather than from its effective date of 1 January 2006.
In March 2005, the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC issued draft guidance on accounting for service concession arrangements drafts D12 to D14.
IFRIC are currently considering the comments received on this draft guidance, with the final guidance expected to be issued in late 2006.
Until the final guidance is issued and endorsed by the EU and in the absence of specific guidance within IFRS, the Group has, from 1 January 2005, recognised the FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions finance debtors relating to concession arrangements held by PPP jointly controlled entities at amortised cost as defined by IAS 39.
FRS 5 fixed assets relating to concession arrangements are accounted for in accordance with IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment.
The effect of adopting this policy is to maintain the accounting within PPP jointly controlled entities in line with existing UK GAAP with the exception of the treatment of interest rate derivatives under IAS 39, whilst ensuring that the accounting treatment complies with existing IFRS.
Basis of consolidation a Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and subsidiaries controlled by the Company drawn up to 31 December 2005.
Control exists when the Group has direct or indirect power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control transfers to the Group until the date that control ceases.
The purchase method is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
b Joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group undertakes an economic activity that is subject to joint control with third parties.
The Groups interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method.
Under this method the Groups share of the profits less losses of jointly controlled entities is included in the consolidated income statement and its interest in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
Where the share of losses exceeds the interest in the entity the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued.
Interest in the entity is the carrying amount of the investment together with any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the net investment in the entity.
Where a Group company is party to a jointly controlled operation, that company accounts for the assets it controls, the liabilities and expenses it incurs and its share of the income.
Such arrangements are reported in the consolidated financial statements on the same basis.
Section 07 Carillion plc Financial Statements Annual Report and Accounts 2005 51 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued Other non-current asset investments Other non-current asset investments are classified as available-for-sale financial assets and are recognised at fair value.
Changes in fair value in the year are recognised directly in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill arising on acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004 represents the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration and the fair value of the identifiable net assets and contingencies of an acquired entity.
Consideration includes the attributable costs of the acquisition.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP.
This is in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1.
Positive goodwill is recognised as an asset in the consolidated balance sheet and is subject to annual impairment review.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is recognised separately as an intangible asset in the consolidated balance sheet.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of jointly controlled entities is included within the carrying value of the investment.
Negative goodwill is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Under previous UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998 was written off to reserves.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 3 Business combinations, this treatment has continued to be applied for those years.
Any goodwill previously written off to reserves remains in reserves.
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is based on the useful economic lives of the assets concerned, which are principally as follows: Computer software and licences Straight line over 3-5 years Customer contracts and lists PMG Reducing balance over 6 years Impairment Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Assets subject to depreciation and amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Construction contracts When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, contract revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the degree of completion of each contract, as measured by the proportion of total costs at the balance sheet date to the estimated total cost of the contract.
Insurance claims and incentive payments arising from construction contracts are included where they have been agreed with the client.
Variations and other claims are included where there is reasonable certainty that the amount will be settled.
When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable those costs will be recoverable.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
Where costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses exceed progress billings, the balance is shown as due from customers on construction contracts within trade and other receivables.
Where progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses, the balance is shown as due to customers on construction contracts within trade and other payables.
Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred until the Group is appointed preferred bidder.
Provided the contract is expected to generate sufficient net cash inflows to enable recovery and the award of the contract is probable, pre-contract costs incurred post the appointment as preferred bidder are included in amounts owed by customers on construction contracts.
Where pre-contract bid costs are reimbursed at financial close, the proceeds are initially applied against the asset included in amounts owed by customers on construction contracts.
Any excess recoveries are carried forward as deferred income and released to profit over the period of the contract.
Carillion plc Section 07 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Financial Statements 52 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding value added tax, for services supplied to external customers.
It also includes the Groups proportion of work carried out under jointly controlled operations during the year.
Revenue from service contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion, as measured by reference to services performed to date as a percentage of total services to be performed.
Revenue from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy on construction contracts.
Property, plant and equipment Depreciation is based on historical or deemed cost, less the estimated residual values, and the estimated economic lives of the assets concerned.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other tangible assets are depreciated in equal annual installments over the period of their estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows: Freehold buildings 40-50 years Leasehold buildings and improvements Period of lease Plant, equipment and vehicles 3-10 years Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease or the expected useful life of the asset.
Leasing Operating lease rental charges are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of each lease.
Assets held under finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of fair value at the date of acquisition or present value of the minimum lease payments.
The capital element of outstanding finance leases is included in financial liabilities.
The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the income statement at a constant periodic rate of charge on the outstanding obligations.
Inventories Inventories comprise raw materials and land for development and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Taxation Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Foreign currencies In individual entities, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling and recorded using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains and losses on translation are included in the income statement.
On consolidation, the balance sheets of overseas entities are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income statements and cash flows of overseas entities are translated into sterling at rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates at the date of the transaction.
Gains or losses arising from the consolidation of overseas entities are recognised in the translation reserve.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 exchange differences that arose prior to 1 January 2004 are presented within the opening retained earnings reserve at that date.
Section 07 Carillion plc Financial Statements Annual Report and Accounts 2005 53 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued Employee benefits a Retirement benefit obligations For defined contribution pension schemes operated by the Group, amounts payable are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The charge to the income statement reflects the current service cost of such obligations.
The expected return on plan assets and the interest cost on scheme liabilities are included within financial income and expenses in the income statement.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the excess of the present value of scheme liabilities over the fair value of scheme assets.
Differences between the actual and expected returns on assets and experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities during the year, together with differences arising from changes in assumptions, are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense in the year.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 cumulative actuarial gains and losses at 1 January 2004 are presented within the opening retained earnings reserve at that date.
The Groups contributions to the schemes are paid in accordance with the rules of the schemes and the recommendation of the actuary.
b Other post-retirement benefit obligations Certain Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to its employees.
The expected costs of providing these benefits are accrued over the period of employment and are calculated by independent actuaries based on the present value of the expected liability.
c Share-based payments In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 Share-based payments has been applied to share options granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005.
Members of the Groups senior management team are entitled to participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
In addition, UK employees are able to participate in the Sharesave scheme.
The fair values of the ESOS and Sharesave schemes at the date of grant are estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The fair value of the LTIP scheme is estimated using a bespoke model that factors in the probabilities of achieving Total Shareholder Return TSR performance conditions.
For all schemes the fair value determined at grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are capitalised where the Group constructs qualifying assets.
All other borrowing costs are written off to the income statement as incurred.
Borrowing costs incurred within the Groups jointly controlled entities relating to the construction of assets in PPP projects are capitalised until the relevant assets are brought into operational use.
Share capital The ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable incremental issue costs.
Consideration paid for shares in the Company held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP Trust are deducted from the retained earnings reserve.
Where such shares subsequently vest in the employees under the terms of the Groups share option schemes or are sold, any consideration received is included in the retained earnings reserve.
Provisions A provision is recognised on the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and where it is probable that an outflow will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has an approved restructuring plan that has either commenced or been announced publicly.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The principal financial assets and liabilities of the Group are as follows: a Trade receivables Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and then are stated at amortised cost.
Carillion plc Section 07 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Financial Statements 54 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued b Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at nominal value.
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, including bank deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are also included as they are an integral part of the Groups cash management.
c Trade payables Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and then are stated at amortised cost.
d Bank and other borrowings Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts and other loans are recognised initially at fair value.
All borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with the difference between initial net proceeds and redemption value recognised in the income statement over the period to redemption.
e Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured in future periods at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting change in fair value is dependent on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument.
A number of the Groups PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
The effective part of the change in fair value of these derivatives is recognised directly in equity.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged items will affect profit or loss.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date.
The Group also enters into forward contracts in order to hedge against small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures.
In cases where these derivative instruments are significant, hedge accounting is applied as described above.
Where hedge accounting is not applied movements in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
Fair values are based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.

The resolution of these proceedings is regarded as unlikely to succeed or to have a material effect on the Groups financial position.
27 Financial instruments Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policies is to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Groups treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board of Directors.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Section 07 Carillion plc Financial Statements Annual Report and Accounts 2005 73 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 27 Financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk The Group operates in a number of overseas regions, primarily Canada, the Middle East and the Caribbean.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet from the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility, foreign currency denominated net assets of overseas operations that exceed 10m equivalent are hedged, as a minimum, at least 50% of the net asset value.
Net investment hedging is achieved through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.
Group policy is to recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of the hedges in equity and to recognise ineffective portions immediately in the income statement.
Profits arising within overseas operations are not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution.
Such distributions are then treated as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
The Group has small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures that are hedged using forward contracts as described above.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest bearing debt is predominantly foreign currency denominated borrowings for hedging net assets of overseas operations and sterling borrowings to finance short-term working capital requirements.
Such borrowings are subject to floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR.
No interest rate hedging is currently undertaken by the Groups subsidiaries.
However, a number of the Groups PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate swaps.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient cash is available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of syndicated and bi-lateral loans and short-term overdraft facilities.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
Credit risk Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counter parties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counter party exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counter party are within predetermined limits.
Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.
Derivative financial instruments 2005 Assets Liabilities m m Forward foreign currency contracts 0.3 In addition to the above, a number of the Groups PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest bearing debts and the associated interest rate derivatives within these PPP jointly controlled entities are without recourse to the Group.
At 31 December 2005, the Groups share of the total net fair value liability of interest rate derivatives in PPP jointly controlled entities amounted to 45.1m, of which 15.5m and the related deferred tax asset of 4.7m has been recognised directly in equity.
Effective interest rates The Groups interest bearing borrowings were subject to effective interest rates at the balance sheet date as follows: Range % Bank overdrafts 3.48 to 6.00 Bank loans 3.81 to 5.13 Finance lease obligations 3.10 to 6.54 Other loans 4.19 to 5.97 Carillion plc Section 07 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Financial Statements 74 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 27 Financial instruments continued Foreign currency exposure The carrying amount of the Groups borrowings denominated in foreign currency is as follows: 2005 2004 m m United States of America Dollars 14.8 13.1 Canadian Dollars 46.3 29.1 Danish Krona 10.6 11.4 Euro 0.2 0.2 Swedish Krona 3.4 71.9 57.2 Of the total foreign currency borrowings of 71.9m 2004: 57.2m, the amount of borrowings used for hedging overseas operations amounts to 34.0m 2004: 32.8m.
The foreign exchange loss of 4.0m 2004: 0.9m gain on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in the translation reserve.
Fair values The book and fair values of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004 are not materially different.

IAS 19 disclosures The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in providing the IAS 19 position were: 2005 2004 UK Canada UK Canada Rate of increase in salaries 4.05% 3.25% 4.00% 3.25% Rate of increase in pensions 2.80% 2.25% 2.75% 2.25% Inflation rate 2.80% 2.25% 2.75% 2.25% Discount rate 4.75% 5.00% 5.30% 6.00% The market values of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present values of the schemes liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on Grade AA corporate bonds.
The assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.
For all schemes the mortality basis is in line with the basis used by the respective Trustee at the last valuation.
As the Trustees review their assumptions according to the valuation cycle the Group will seek independent advice on any appropriate changes.
Carillion plc Section 07 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Financial Statements 80 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 31 Retirement benefit obligations continued The overall expected rate of return on assets is determined by reference to local long term interest rates, the yield on gilts or Treasury stock and the Actuarys recommendation on the allowance for the potential long term extra return from investing in equities.
No credit has been taken for the potential extra yield above gilts or Treasury stock for investment in corporate debt when determining the projected pension cost charged to the income statement.
Carillion Canada Inc operates an unfunded healthcare scheme for retired employees.
For the purposes of the actuarial valuation of the scheme the immediate medical cost trend is 9% per annum falling to 5% per annum by 2010.
An increase of 1% in the medical cost trend would increase the scheme liabilities by 0.6m and the total service cost by 0.04m.
A decrease of 1% in the medical cost trend would reduce liabilities by 0.5m and total service cost by 0.03m.
Carillion has adopted immediate recognition of any actuarial gains or losses through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense as permitted under IAS 19.

33 Accounting estimates and judgements Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and their application.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below: Construction contracts In determining the revenue and costs to be recognised each year for work done on construction contracts, estimates are made in relation to final out turn on each contract.
Management continually review estimated final out turn on contracts and make adjustments where necessary.
Impairment of goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill is attached.
Note 12 provides details of the carrying value of goodwill.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made.
The key assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group: Expected return on plan assets Inflation rate Mortality Discount rate Salary and pension increases Details of the assumptions used are included in note 31.
34 Principal subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and jointly controlled operations A list of significant investments in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and jointly controlled operations, including the name, country of incorporation and proportion of ownership interest is given on page 94.
35 Explanation of transition to IFRS These are the Groups first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The accounting policies set out in note 1 have been applied in preparing the consolidated financial statements, including comparative information for the year to 31 December 2004 and the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 the Groups date of transition.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet and comparative information for the year to 31 December 2004, the Group has adjusted amounts previously reported in financial statements prepared in accordance with previous GAAP.
In addition, following the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, the Group has adjusted previously restated total equity at 1 January 2005.

Disclosure of the potential impact of FRS 17 has been included in the Groups annual report and accounts since 2001.
As permitted by IAS 19, the Group has opted to recognise immediately and in full the actuarial gains and losses arising in each accounting period in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
This treatment is similar to the requirements of FRS 17.
Under IAS 19 the surplus or deficit relating to defined benefit schemes are recognised on the balance sheet of the Group.
Although the methodology for determining the income statement charge is similar to SSAP 24, the actuarial assumptions are different.
In particular, IAS 19 requires the discount rate used in the evaluation of scheme liabilities to be based on market yields on high quality corporate bonds at the balance sheet date.
In contrast, SSAP 24 required the use of long-term investment return rate to discount liabilities.
The difference in approach to the discount rate used can lead to a more volatile income statement charge under IAS 19 compared to SSAP 24.
Carillion plc Section 07 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Financial Statements 84 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 35 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Business combinations IFRS 3 Business combinations covers the accounting for acquisitions, which is dealt with under UK GAAP by FRS 6 Acquisitions and mergers, FRS 7 Fair values in acquisition accounting, and FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets.
IFRS 3 strictly prohibits the use of merger accounting that in certain circumstances can be applied under UK GAAP.
Although goodwill arising on business combinations is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet under both IFRS and UK GAAP, IFRS 3 prohibits the amortisation of goodwill.
Instead, IFRS 3 requires goodwill to be subject to annual impairment reviews.
In addition, goodwill previously written off to reserves under UK GAAP remains in reserves under IFRS and is not recycled through the income statement on disposal of the business to which it relates.
The adjustment in the table above relates primarily to goodwill previously written off to reserves on the original acquisitions of Crown House Engineering and Carillion BTP, which were both disposed of in 2004.
The impairment of goodwill under IFRS relates to UK Highways Services Limited reflecting the reduction in future cash flows as we move nearer to the end of its maintenance contract in 2007.
Share-based payments IFRS 2 Share-based payments replaces UITF 17 Employee share schemes under UK GAAP.
IFRS 2 requires the fair value cost of providing employee share option schemes to be charged to the income statement, and in respect of equity settled share-based payments, recognised directly in equity.
This differs to the UITF 17 approach under which the charge to the income statement is based on the intrinsic value of the share options.
The scope of IFRS 2 is wider than UITF 17 as it relates to all share-based payments.
Consequently, Save as You Earn SAYE schemes are within the scope of IFRS 2, whereas under UITF 17 they are specifically exempt.
Deferred tax IAS 12 Income taxes is the IFRS equivalent of FRS 16 Current tax and FRS 19 Deferred taxation under UK GAAP.
There is no change to the basis of calculating current income tax as a result of adopting IAS 12.
However, the basis of calculating deferred tax changes from an income statement approach under FRS 19 to a balance sheet approach under IAS 12.
The balance sheet approach compares the tax value with the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Of the additional requirements of IAS 12, the most significant is the requirement to recognise a deferred tax liability in respect of the unremitted earnings of overseas entities, where their distribution cannot be controlled or planned by the Group.
Proposed dividends IAS 10 revised 2003 Events after the balance sheet date is the FRS equivalent of SSAP 17 Accounting for post balance sheet events in the UK.
Both standards are similar except in respect of the accounting treatment of dividends.
Under IAS 10, dividends declared and approved by shareholders after the balance sheet date are not permitted to be recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
This differs from the UK GAAP treatment of proposed dividends, which are accrued for the in the financial period to which they relate.
The adjustment to equity at 31 December 2004 and 1 January 2004 reflects the reversal of the proposed dividend accrued in the 2004 and 2003 financial statements respectively.
Financial instruments The accounting for, and presentation of, financial instruments is dealt with under IFRS by IAS 32 Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation and IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
Under UK GAAP there is no comprehensive standard which addresses the accounting for financial instruments.
In the UK, FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures requires certain disclosures to be made.
IAS 39 requires the fair value of derivative financial instruments to be included on balance sheet, whereas under UK GAAP they are not recognised.
The Group does not enter into significant derivative transactions.
However, a number of the Groups PPP jointly controlled entities enter into interest rate swap derivatives.
These are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39 and the Groups share of the movements in fair value are recognised directly in the hedging reserve within equity provided the hedge is effective.
In addition, other non-current asset investments are classified as available-for-sale assets in accordance with IAS 39.
These investments are held on the balance sheet at fair value, with movements in fair value between reporting periods recognised in the fair value reserve within equity.
