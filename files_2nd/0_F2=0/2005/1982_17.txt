Following the impairment test, the recoverable amounts for each cash generating unit exceeded the carrying amount of goodwill recorded, with the exception of one cash generating unit where a goodwill charge of 0.2 million has been recognised through other operating expenses in respect of the goodwill arising on an acquisition made in France in 2000, and principally resulted from a shortfall in the post acquisition performance of the cash generating unit.
The recoverable amount for the cash generating unit has been measured based on a value in use calculation.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10.4% was used in the value in use calculation.
The allocation of goodwill to cash generating units has been completed during the year and has been allocated to both business and geographical segments.
The carrying amounts of goodwill by geographical segment are as follows: As at As at 31st December 31st December 2005 2004 m m UK & Eire 29.7 34.2 Scandinavia 178.6 185.3 Other Europe 78.8 75.5 Total 287.1 295.0 In testing goodwill for impairment, the recoverable amount of each segments goodwill is calculated, based on their discounted cash ows.
Future cash ows are based on board approved budgets and strategic plans for a period of the next three years.
Forecasts for the following years are conservatively extrapolated based on the growth rate and profitability outlined in the approved plans.
The following key assumptions in the value in use calculations were uniformly applied to each cash generating unit: Budgeted revenue and salary growth was based on the groups approved budgets and strategic plans between 2006 and 2008.
Budgeted margin between 2006 and 2008 was based on the average achieved margin in the twelve month period before the budget period uplifted for expected efficiency improvements which management believes are reasonably achievable.
Growth rates reected within the cash ows have been increased in line with historic GDP for the appropriate country.
UK & Eire Scandinavia Other Europe Revenue growth after 2009 2.5% 2.0% 0.5% Salary growth after 2009 3%4% 3%3.5% 1.3%5% Discount rate pre-tax 7.3%10.5% 9.3%10.9% 7.7%10.9% Management are of the opinion that it does not currently foresee a reasonable possible change in the key assumptions it has employed when determining the value in use calculations.
As noted earlier, there has been an impairment charged in the accounts in respect of a cash generating unit that is included within the Other Europe segment.
The carrying value of the cash generating unit now equals value in use.

The actuarial valuations of the principal scheme, together with eight other dened benefit schemes operated by the group have each been updated as at 31st December 2005 by qualied actuaries using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries were: 2005 2004 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.7 3.9 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.7 2.9 Discount rate 4.8 5.5 Ination rate 2.7 2.9 Expected return on plan assets Equities 7.5 7.8 Bonds 4.9 4.9 The actuarial valuation also assumes that mortality will be in line with nationally published PMA92 and PFA92 mortality tables incorporating projected improvements to life expectancy to 2000 current pensioners and 2020 non-retired members.
This is based on the actuarys best estimate of mortality within the scheme.

i Presentation of financial results and information The format of the IFRS financial statements has been presented in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, which differs from its UK GAAP equivalents.
In particular there is no equivalent to FRS 3 Reporting Financial Performance in IFRS.
Under IFRS non-operating exceptional items will be reported as part of a single measure of operating profit on the face of the income statement.
However the group will continue to disclose an adjusted earnings per share in the notes to the financial statements to reect earnings per share before one-off items.
ii Business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets IFRS 3 Business combinations requires that goodwill arising from business combinations should not be amortised and will be tested annually for impairment.
Further, certain intangible assets, previously subsumed within goodwill under UK GAAP, are now required to be recognised separately and amortised over their estimated useful life.
The group has elected not to restate previous business combinations as permitted by IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
However, acquisition accounting for acquisitions made during 2004 have been restated in accordance with IFRS 3 and IAS 38 Intangible Assets, which has resulted in the recognition of certain intangible assets relating to customer contracts and lists and intellectual property rights.
These intangible assets are being amortised over their estimated useful life.
In the case of customer contracts this relates to the period over which the company expects to benefit from the contracts, between 2 and 5 years.
As a result, amortisation relating to goodwill on the balance sheet at the date of transition net of the amortisation charged on intangible assets has been reversed, resulting in a net credit to the income statement of 19.8m for the year ended 31st December 2004.
Under IAS 38 Intangible assets, certain assets, primarily computer software have been reclassied from property, plant and equipment to intangible.
iii Post employment benets Under IFRS the group will reect the fair value of pension obligations and related pension fund assets in its balance sheet and recognise previously unprovided pension liabilities and deficits.
These were not required under UK GAAP, SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs where actuarial deficits are amortised over a number of years to the income statement.
The retirement obligation liability, in accordance with IAS 19 Employee benets, is 71.2m and 42.5m the period ending 31st December 2004 and 2003 respectively.
Of the 71.2m net retirement obligation liability arising as at 31st December 2004, the group had already provided for 24.2m in its 2004 Annual Report and Accounts under UK GAAP, leaving an unprovided amount of 47.0m.
IAS 19 is very close to the valuation basis of FRS17 Retirement benets previously disclosed in our accounts.
The unprovided FRS 17 pension deficit disclosed in the groups Annual Report and Accounts for 2004 was 46.2m note 8, with the variation in the pension liabilities between IAS 19 and FRS 17 arising due to a change in assumptions in the Irish dened benefit scheme to conform more closely to the rest of the group.
The groups pension charge, based on IAS 19, has been reduced by 0.9m for the year ended 31st December 2004 compared with the amount previously recorded under SSAP 24.
Under IFRS, changes in pension deficits or surpluses resulting from actuarial experience are charged to equity and separately disclosed in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The triennial valuation of the RBS fund in 2004 resulted in a charge to equity of 30.2m.
iv Deferred and current taxes The scope of IAS 12 Income Taxes is considerably wider than its UK GAAP equivalent FRS 19 Deferred taxes, and requires deferred tax to be provided on all temporary differences i. e. differences between tax and accounting carrying values rather than on certain taxable timing differences, which impact differences in the recognition of items in the income statement for accounting and tax purposes, under UK GAAP.
The principal areas of impact are on revalued properties and rolled over gains on the sale of properties which now require tax effecting in the period of sale rather than when they are ultimately realised.
v Share based payments IFRS 2 Share-based payments requires that an expense for grants of equity instruments is recognised at fair value at the date of grant.
The group has taken the exemption under IFRS 1, not to apply IFRS 2 to grants made before 7th November 2002.
This expense, which is in relation to share options schemes, is recognised over the vesting period of the relevant scheme.
The group has adopted the Black-Scholes pricing model for the purposes of computing fair value under IFRS.
The additional pre-tax expense from the adoption of IFRS 2 on the groups consolidated income statement is 0.1m for the year ended 31st December 2004. vi Post balance sheet events IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date requires that dividends declared after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a liability at that balance sheet date as the liability does not represent a present obligation as dened by IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
The final dividend in respect of the year ended 31st December 2004 of 23.0m has been reversed in the IFRS balance sheet as at 31st December 2004 and will be charged in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity for the year ending 31st December 2005. vii Non current assets held for sale In 2003, the group announced the sale HSS, its tool hire division, which completed in January 2004.
Under IFRS 5, non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, the assets and liabilities held for sale have been disclosed and presented separately from other assets and liabilities in the groups consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2003.
Further, UK GAAP required that 18.6m of goodwill previously written off directly to reserves be recycled to the income statement in calculating the gain on sale of HSS.
This is not required under IFRS.
The group has further reclassied properties as held for sale as at 31st December 2004.
These assets have also been disclosed and presented separately from other assets and liabilities in the groups consolidated balance sheet as at 31st December 2004. viii Financial instruments IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement addresses the accounting and reporting of financial instruments.
We have taken the IFRS 1 exemption not to apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 to our comparative period, therefore this will be applicable for the first time for the year ending 31st December 2005.
The introduction of this standard will require the group to document all of its hedging relationships, should it seek to qualify for hedge accounting.
There is no impact on the groups net assets had it elected to adopt IAS 32 39 at 1st January 2004. ix Upon transition to IFRS there has been no impact on the groups cashow.
