Financial risk management The Group enters into contracts involving financial instruments during the normal course of its business in order to maximise interest earned on the Groups available liquidity.
Such financial instruments, which are primarily term deposits and certificates of deposit, are not held for trading purposes.
In addition, certain financial instruments such as market debtors and creditors arise directly from the Groups operations.
The Groups overall strategy and policies for monitoring and management of financial risk are set by the board of directors.
The Treasury Department, reporting through the Banking Committee to the Board, has principal responsibility for investing surplus liquidity and for monitoring exposure to market risk which includes interest rate risk and currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
All procedures and delegated authorities are documented in a Group Treasury Manual, and policy documents are in place to cover the management and monitoring of each type of risk.
Operational, reputational and legal risks are actively monitored by the Risk Management Committee which works with divisional management to identify and grade the different risks to which the business and support areas are exposed.
Active steps are taken to mitigate or control risks wherever practicable.
