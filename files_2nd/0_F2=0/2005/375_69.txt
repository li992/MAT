Unaudited performance graph The following graph illustrates the Companys TSR between 31 December 2000 and 31 December 2005 relative to the FTSE Media & Entertainment Index, in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Aegis Group plc is a member of the FTSE Media & Entertainment Index and the Remuneration Committee considers that a comparison of the Companys TSR relative to similar businesses is more appropriate than a comparison with a general FTSE Index, in order to reduce the impact of general stock market trends.
