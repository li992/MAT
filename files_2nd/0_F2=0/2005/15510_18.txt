Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards in the UK.
The key Group accounting policies are summarised below to facilitate the interpretation of the financial statements.
Further details on the application of critical accounting policies are set out in the Operating and financial review on pages 6 to 17.
Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the valuation of listed current and fixed asset investments.
Basis of consolidation The financial statements consolidate the accounts of Marconi Corporation plc and all of its subsidiary undertakings Group companies or subsidiaries.
All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
All Group companies accounts have been prepared for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Turnover Turnover excludes VAT and comprises sales to outside customers.
Revenue from product sales of hardware and software is recognised when: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, customer acceptance has occurred, Marconis price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
Revenue from services is recognised at the time of performance and acceptance by the customer.
Revenue from multiple element contracts is allocated based on the fair value of each individual element.
Revenue on long-term contracts is recognised under the  method of accounting and is calculated based on the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with the total expected costs for that contract.
Currency translation Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rates at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates ruling at that date.
These translation differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account with the exception of certain gains and losses arising under hedging transactions as described below.
Profits and losses of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average rates of exchange during the year.
Non-sterling net assets are translated at year end rates of exchange.
Key rates used are as follows: Average rates Year-end rates 2005 2004 2005 2004 US Dollar 1.8504 1.7023 1.8896 1.8379 Euro 1.4632 1.4435 1.4540 1.4956 The differences arising from the restatement of profits and losses and the retranslation of the opening net liabilities to year end rates are taken to reserves.
Acquisitions and disposals On the acquisition of a business, including an interest in an associated undertaking, fair values are attributed to the Groups share of separate net assets.
Where the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair values attributable to such net assets, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill capitalised in the balance sheet in the year of acquisition.
The profit or loss on the disposal or closure of a previously acquired business includes the attributable amount of any purchased goodwill relating to that business not previously charged to the profit and loss account.
The results and cash flows relating to a business are included in the consolidated profit and loss account and the consolidated cash flow statement from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Financial instruments Prior to the financial restructuring in May 2003, the Group used financial instruments, including derivatives principally interest rate swaps, cancellable interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage interest rate and currency exposures.
In February 2005 the Group recommenced hedging of foreign currency cash flows with forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group is reviewing its interest rate hedging policy and any requirement for interest rate hedging instruments to mitigate interest rate risks.
For a forward foreign exchange contract to be treated as a hedge the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or to a probable commitment.
It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
Gains and losses arising on these contracts are deferred and recognised in the profit and loss account only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in the Groups financial statements.
50 1 Accounting policies continued Hedges of the net investment in overseas subsidiaries The Groups policy is to finance where possible its activities in the same currencies as those used for its foreign investments in order to hedge foreign currency exposure of net investments in foreign operations.
This policy is implemented by financing in the related currency.
Exchange gains or losses arising in the hedging borrowings are dealt with as a movement in reserves to the extent they offset losses or gains on the hedged investment.
Interest rate risk exposure Prior to the financial restructuring in May 2003, it was the Groups policy to hedge its exposure to movements in interest rates associated with its borrowing primarily by means of interest rate swaps.
Payments and receipts under interest rate swap agreements, specifically designated for hedging purposes, are recorded in the profit and loss account on an accruals basis.
Gains and losses arising on termination of hedging instruments, where the underlying exposure remains, are recognised in the profit and loss account over the remaining life of the hedging instrument.
No interest rate swaps were transacted between May 2003 and March 2005.
It is current Group policy that there is no trading in financial instruments or derivatives, and that all financial instruments and derivatives are used solely for the purpose of hedging identified exposures of the Group.
Tangible fixed assets Property, plant, machinery, fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives from the time they are brought in to use.
Freehold land does not bear depreciation where the original cost of purchase was separately identified.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated using the following rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 4% per annum Leasehold property Over the period of the lease or 50 years for long leases Plant and machinery 10% per annum on average Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 10% per annum Leased assets Assets held under finance leases and other similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned assets, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms or their useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of the capital repayments outstanding.
Hire purchase transactions are dealt with similarly except that assets are depreciated over their useful lives.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Goodwill Purchased goodwill is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful economic life.
Each acquisition is separately evaluated for the purposes of determining the useful economic life, up to a maximum of 20 years.
The useful economic lives are reviewed annually and revised if necessary.
Research and development Expenditure incurred in the year is charged against profit unless specifically chargeable to and receivable from customers under agreed contract terms.
Stock Stock is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Contracts in progress Profit on long-term contracts in progress is taken when a sale is recorded on part delivery of products or part performance of services, provided that the outcome of the contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Amounts recoverable on long-term contracts, which are included in debtors, are stated at the net sales value of the work done less amounts received as progress payments on account.
Excess progress payments are included in creditors as payments received in advance.
Cumulative costs incurred net of amounts transferred to cost of sales, less provision for contingencies and anticipated future losses on contracts, are included as long-term contract balances in stock.
51 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Warranties Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold.
These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claims and take the following into consideration: the history of warranty cost associated with the product or similar products: the length of the warranty obligation: the development cycle of the product: and the estimated cost of one-off failures that require correction.
Taxation Taxation on profit on ordinary activities is that which has been paid or becomes payable in respect of the profits for the year, after taking account of adjustments in respect of prior period liabilities.
Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income or expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Investments Joint ventures comprise long-term investments where control is shared under a contractual arrangement.
The sector analysis of turnover, profit and net assets excludes the Groups share of the results and net assets of joint ventures.
Associates consist of long-term investments in which the Group holds a participating interest and over which it exercises significant influence.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are stated at the amount of the Groups share of net assets including goodwill derived from audited or management accounts made up to the balance sheet date.
Loss before taxation includes the Groups share of joint ventures and associates.
Other unlisted fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value, unless they have been transferred from associates at net book value.
Listed fixed asset investments are stated at market value.
Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value except dated listed securities, which are stated at market value.
Pensions and other post retirement benefits The operating cost for providing pensions and other post retirement benefits, as calculated periodically by independent actuaries, is charged to the Groups operating profit or loss in the year that those benefits are earned by employees.
The financial returns expected on the pension schemes assets are recognised in the year in which they arise as part of finance income and the effect of the unwinding of the discounted value of the pension schemes liabilities is treated as part of finance costs.
The changes in value of the pension schemes assets and liabilities are reported as actuarial gains or losses as they arise in the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The pension schemes surpluses, to the extent they are considered recoverable, or deficits are recognised in full and presented in the balance sheet net of any related deferred tax.
Government grants Government grants relating to R&D activities are credited to the profit and loss account as the related expenditure is incurred.
Share options The costs of awarding shares under employee share plans are generally charged to the profit and loss account over the period to which the performance criteria relate.
Finance costs Finance costs of debt are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of such instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the year.
Liquid resources Liquid resources comprise term deposits with an original maturity of generally less than one year and other readily disposable current asset investments.

Optical and Access Networks comprises the activities of our Optical Networks and Access Networks businesses, which now also includes our payphones and interactive systems activities previously reported under Other Network Equipment.
Optical and Access Networks comprise the design and supply of communications systems that transmit and switch voice, data and video traffic predominantly via public networks.
BBRS comprises the equipment and services activities of our North American based business which designs and supplies routing and switching products for the transmission of voice, data and video in both public and private networks.
Network Services comprises the activities of our Installation, Commissioning and Maintenance IC&M and Value Added Services VAS businesses.
Network Services generally comprises activities that supply a broad range of communications support services to telecommunications operators as well as selected large enterprises and government agencies.
The previous structure had been adopted to comply with the requirements of our Loan Notes which required segmentation along certain geographic lines.
Comparative information for the year ended 31 March 2004 has been restated to reflect the new segments.
The operating net assets of Optical and Access Networks and Network Services cannot be separately identified as the same assets are generally used to generate sales in each of these segments.
The results of these segments are separately reportable.
Central costs include 25 million of share option and related payroll costs 2004: 31 million.
Other consists of previous non-core businesses sold in the year ended 31 March 2004.
Operating net assets liabilities include tangible fixed assets, stocks, debtors, creditors excluding borrowings and taxation and provisions for liabilities and charges.

The remaining goodwill on the balance sheet would be amortised under UK GAAP over an average period of approximately four years.
It is not practical to disclose goodwill amortisation on a segmental basis as any allocation would be arbitrary.

Exceptional items are shown in further detail in note 4.
The Group disposed of its Outside Plant and Power OPP business in the year ended 31 March 2005 and its North American Access NAA business during the year ended 31 March 2004.
It is these activities which are shown as Discontinued Operations in the table above.

In the year ended 31 March 2004, 9 million was credited to restructuring costs, which mainly related to the release of liability provisions held against the outsourcing of certain manufacturing operations.
ii As part of the Groups cost reduction actions, a net charge of 16 million 2004: 89 million was recorded during the year ended 31 March 2005.
This includes 20 million 2004: 64 million for employee severance, a net nil charge 2004: 12 million for site rationalisation and other restructuring costs and a 4 million credit 2004: 13 million charge in respect of the release of liability provisions associated with the Groups financial restructuring in May 2003. iii In Part X, section 15.4 of our listing particulars of 31 March 2003 we disclosed the lawsuit filed by Bell Communications Research Inc. now known as Telcordia Technologies Inc. or Telcordia.
A settlement agreement, in which we agreed to make a one-time payment of $21 million approximately 12 million to Telcordia, was signed on 24 June 2004 in exchange for a licence to Telcordias ATM patent portfolio and as full and final settlement of all outstanding claims.
As a consequence of this claim, we have made an exceptional release of 2 million of excess provision to our operating results in the year ended 31 March 2005 5 million was charged in relation to this claim in the year ended 31 March 2004. iv In light of the declining market and economic trends the Group experienced during the year ended 31 March 2002, an exceptional provision against bad and doubtful debts was created.
Of this amount, 4 million was reassessed and released to the profit and loss account in the year ended 31 March 2004.

The 77 million gain on disposals of joint ventures and associates related to the gain on disposal of Easynet Group plc 76 million and Confirmant Limited 1 million.
The 25 million gain on disposal of fixed assets and investments in Continuing Operations was comprised of a gain on disposal of Marconi Mobile Access S. p. A. also known as UMTS of 9 million and other fixed asset investments of 22 million, partially offset by a pension settlement loss of 6 million arising on the disposal of our interest in GDA.
c Amounts written off investments The change in value of the Groups investments is accounted for in line with the Group accounting policy whereby listed investments are marked to their market value at the end of each reporting year and unlisted investments are held at the lower of cost and recoverable value.
d Gain on waiver of balance payable to M 2003 plc group As part of the Groups financial restructuring in May 2003, Marconi Corporation plc and its subsidiaries entered into an agreement with M 2003 plc and its direct subsidiaries to reassign and waive balances between the M 2003 plc group and the Marconi Corporation plc Group.

In the year ended 31 March 2004 a non-operating net tax credit of 12 million arose due to the release of tax provisions of 20 million in respect of prior years following the Companys scheme of arrangement offset by a tax charge of 8 million on the disposal of NAA.

The Group will incur ongoing tax cash costs where losses are unavailable to cover any historic tax audit adjustments and or future taxable profits.
8 Equity minority interests Equity minority interests represent the share of profits less losses on ordinary activities attributable to the interests of equity shareholders in subsidiaries which are not wholly owned by the Group.
58 9 Equity dividends The directors do not propose a dividend for the year ended 31 March 2005.
No dividends were declared for the year ended 31 March 2004.
10 Profit loss per share Basic and adjusted profit loss per share is calculated by reference to a weighted average of 204.5 million ordinary shares 2004: 249.0 million ordinary shares in issue during the year.
In 2005 the effect of share options is dilutive.
The undiluted weighted average number of shares has been adjusted by 12.4 million in respect of outstanding share options to give a diluted weighted average of 216.9 million ordinary shares.
This gives a basic diluted profit per share of 9.7p.
The effect of share options is anti-dilutive in 2004 and has therefore been excluded from the calculation of the diluted weighted average number of shares.
An adjusted profit loss per share has been presented in order to highlight the underlying performance of the Group, and is calculated as set out in the table below: Year ended 31 March 2005 Year ended 31 March 2004 Profit loss Profit loss Profit loss per share Profit loss per share million Pence million Pence Basic profit loss and basic profit loss per share 21 10.3 153 61.4 Operating exceptional items Restructuring costs included in cost of sales 5 2.4 9 3.6 Restructuring costs 16 7.8 89 35.7 Decrease increase in provision for litigation settlement 2 1.0 5 2.0 Releases in respect of doubtful debts 4 1.6 Non-operating exceptional items Gain on disposal of Discontinued Operations 103 50.4 75 30.1 Gain on disposal of joint ventures and associates 77 30.9 Gain on disposal of investments in Continuing Operations 25 10.1 Amounts written off investments 2 0.8 Gain on waiver of balance payable to M 2003 plc group 25 10.0 Goodwill amortisation 91 44.5 103 41.4 Write off of capitalised losses on swaps 46 18.4 Exceptional tax credit 12 4.8 Adjusted profit loss and adjusted profit loss per share 18 8.8 135 54.2 59 Notes to the accounts continued 11 Employees a Directors remuneration Details of the directors remuneration specified for audit by the UK Listing Authority are given in the Report to shareholders by the Board on directors remuneration.

62 16 Debtors continued The Group has assigned certain trade debts as security against the advance of cash from a third party provider.
All debts remain outstanding at 31 March 2005 and interest of 55,000 was recognised in the year.
The Group is not obliged to, nor does it intend to, support any credit-related losses arising from the assigned debts against which cash has been advanced.
The transaction documents stipulate that, in the event of default in payment by a debtor, the providers of the facility may only seek payment from the Group of the capped finance charge under the arrangement and that recourse to the Group is not available.
The Group has available to it uncommitted customer receivables financing facilities totalling b79 million 54 million.
Whilst the facilities do not have formal expiry dates, b19 million 13 million is due for review in December 2005 and b60 million 41 million is due for review in March 2006.

The associated outflows are generally expected to occur over the next year with vacant property costs being incurred over the next three years.
Warranties and contracts mainly comprise the expected costs of maintenance under guarantees, other work in respect of products delivered and losses on contract work in progress in excess of related accumulated cost.
The associated outflows are generally expected to occur over the lives of the products.
Contracts and commitments comprise liquidated damages, onerous supply contracts and losses on contract work in progress in excess of related accumulated costs.
The associated outflows are generally expected to occur over the lives of the contracts, which are long term in nature.
Litigation and indemnities comprise expected employee related claims, environmental liabilities mainly in North America, other litigation, captive insurance balances and merger and acquisition balances held against warranties provided on the disposal of businesses.
Employee related claims relate to industrial diseases.
The Groups exposure to these claims, which has been assessed by actuaries, amounts to 18 million 2004: 19 million after discounting at a rate of 4.5%, in line with long-term government bond yields at 31 March 2005.
Other provisions mainly comprise payroll taxes on share options and other post-retirement agreements.

In total 49.8 million warrants, exercisable up until May 2007, were issued at an exercise price of 1.50 each.
As a result of the subsequent one for five share consolidation, five warrants must now be exercised per 25p ordinary share, giving an aggregate subscription price of 7.50 per share.
At 31 March 2005, 49.6 million warrants remained outstanding.
c Share options At 31 March 2005 the following share options were outstanding in respect of the Companys ordinary shares: Number of shares Subscription under option price per Exercise million share period Management Plan Granted 24 June 2003 8.5 Nil May 2004 to May 2013 Granted 1 September 2003 0.6 Nil May 2004 to May 2013 Granted 13 February 2004 1.1 Nil October 2004 to February 2014 Employee Plan Granted 30 June 2003 4.4 3.08 May 2004 to May 2013 Granted 1 September 2003 0.2 4.29 May 2004 to May 2013 Granted 13 February 2004 7.17 May 2004 to February 2014 Granted 1 December 2004 0.7 5.72 December 2006 to August 2008 Granted 6 December 2004 0.1 5.67 December 2006 to August 2008 Sharesave Plan Granted 3 February 2005 1.7 5.06 April 2005 to September 2008 The movement in share options during the year can be analysed as follows: Number of Number of shares under shares under option at Number of Number of Number of option at 1 April options options options 31 March 2004 granted forfeited exercised 2005 million million million million million Management Plan 17.6 7.4 10.2 Employee Plan 6.1 0.8 0.2 1.3 5.4 Sharesave Plan 1.7 1.7 Total 23.7 2.5 0.2 8.7 17.3 The subscription price per share, in respect of options granted under the Employee Plan on 30 June 2003, is a mean average as the rules regarding exercise price differ between Italy and the rest of the world.
The overall impact on the Groups profit and loss account over the life of the plans through to the financial year ending 31 March 2007, assuming the final performance target is also met, will be approximately 59 million before payroll taxes.
We expect the remaining charge under UK GAAP, before payroll taxes, to be 9 million in the year ended 31 March 2006 and 2 million in the year ended 31 March 2007.
The 59 million charge is a non-cash item.
During the year, the aggregate gain on share options exercised by the directors amounted to 13,806,480 2004: nil.

These balances were being credited to the Companys profit and loss reserve.
The high court determined that any surplus over the deficit at 31 March 2003 was to be held as non-distributable reserves that would be transferred to the profit and loss reserve as losses are incurred or when all creditors as at 21 May 2003 have been satisfied.
Company losses of 97 million have been transferred in the year 2004: 60 million.

71 Notes to the accounts continued 26 Post retirement benefits Marconi operates defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom, USA, Germany and Italy, and post-retirement benefit plans in the USA.
The most significant plan is the GEC 1972 Plan the UK Plan in the UK.
A full actuarial valuation for the UK Plan was carried out as at 5 April 2002 and a valuation for accounting purposes was carried out as at 31 March 2005 by independent qualified actuaries.
A further full actuarial valuation is being carried out as at 5 April 2005, the results of which will be available in the second half of the year ending 31 March 2006.
For the US plans, full valuations were carried out at 1 January 2003 and 1 January 2004 and updated as applicable to 31 March 2005 by independent qualified actuaries.
For the German and Italian unfunded plans, valuations were carried out for accounting purposes at 31 March 2005 by independent qualified actuaries.
The contributions made to the plans in the year totalled 17 million 2004: 21 million.
Benefit payments in the accounting period totalled 9 million 2004: 17 million.
For the unfunded pension plans and the post retirement medical plans, payments are made when the benefits are provided.
Company contributions to the UK Plan are 8.2% of pensionable pay.
In the USA, on 25 March 2003, the Group signed a funding agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation PBGC for the US defined benefit schemes.
This agreement was amended on 17 February 2004.
Under this agreement, Marconi was required to contribute $2.25 million at the end of each calendar quarter to its US defined benefit plans, in addition to the annual normal cost associated with the continuation of benefits.
Effective from 13 August 2004, the quarterly contribution was reduced to $1.75 million due to the transfer of the Reltec Retirement liability to Emerson.
Additionally, proceeds from any disposal of US businesses shall be used to fund the scheme deficits.
The Group operates defined contribution schemes in addition to the defined benefit schemes listed.
Contributions to these schemes amounted to 3 million 2004: 5 million.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries to determine the liabilities on a FRS 17 basis for the significant defined benefit plans are set out below: At 31 March 2005 At 31 March 2004 At 31 March 2003 UK Rest of the UK Rest of the UK Rest of the Average assumptions used % pa world % pa % pa world % pa % pa world % pa Rate of general increase in salaries 4.25 4.12 4.75 4.17 4.50 4.17 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.75 1.50 2.75 1.50 2.50 1.50 Rate of increase for deferred pensioners 2.75 N A 2.75 N A 2.50 N A Rate of credited interest 2.50 N A 3.00 N A 4.00 N A Discount rate applied to liabilities 5.50 5.11 5.50 5.63 5.25 6.00 Inflation assumption 2.75 2.12 2.75 2.25 2.50 2.22 Expected healthcare trend rates N A 11.0 N A 11.5 N A 12.0 pre and pre and pre and post 65, post 65, post 65, reducing to reducing to reducing to 6.0 after 6.0after 6.0after 2012 2012 2012 Expected prescription drug trend rates N A 13.0 N A 14.0 N A 15.0 reducing to reducing to reducing to 6.0 after 6.0 after 6.0 after 2012 2012 2012 The UK Plan provides benefits to members on the best of three bases.
One of the bases is a money purchase underpin in which a discretionary level of credited interest is applied to a percentage of members contributions.
The discretionary level of credited interest has been treated as a constructive obligation.

74 26 Post retirement benefits continued Analysis of amount recognised in the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses STRGL 2005 2004 million million Rest of the Post Rest of the Post world retirement world retirement pension medical pension medical UK Plan plans plans Total UK Plan plans plans Total Expected return less actual return on pension scheme assets gains losses 71 4 67 115 15 130 Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities 1 2 1 9 2 3 10 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities losses gains 57 10 67 33 10 1 44 Actuarial gain loss recognised in STRGL 14 15 2 1 91 3 2 96 The main element of the amount recognised in the STRGL in both years has resulted from the difference between the actual rate of return and expected rate of return on the plans assets.
In the year ended 31 March 2005, actual investment returns in the UK Plan exceeded expected returns across all classes of assets, resulting in a substantial asset gain.
In the year ended 31 March 2004, asset gains were experienced for both the UK and US funded plans, primarily due to the recovery of equity markets.
The second largest impact on the STRGL in both years has been the losses resulting from changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the plans liabilities.
At 31 March 2005, revisions to the UK Plan mortality assumption have led to a STRGL loss of 102 million.
This revision recognised observed improvements in longevity in line with the most recent available plan data, plus an allowance for likely improvements in the future.
In the UK Plan, the trustees have discretion to credit interest bonuses to pension awards.
During the year, our credited interest assumption has been reduced from 3.0% to 2.5% to align with actual expected awards, providing a STRGL gain.
A further STRGL gain was recognised from a reduction in our salary growth assumption.
At 31 March 2004, in the UK Plan, the reduction of our credited interest assumption provided a gain.
Offsetting this gain was a loss resulting from revised mortality assumptions, recognising observed improvements in longevity at that date.
At 31 March 2005, due to movements in Eurobond rates during the year, the German and Italian Plan discount rates were reduced.
The German Plan discount rate was reduced from 5.50% at 31 March 2004 to 4.50% at 31 March 2005.
The Italian Plan discount rate was reduced from 5.00% at 31 March 2004 to 4.00% at 31 March 2005.
Both of these changes resulted in STRGL losses.
At 31 March 2004, due to movements in AA corporate bond rates in the UK and US, the UK discount rate was increased from 5.25% to 5.50% leading to a gain, and the US discount rate was decreased from 6.25% to 5.75% leading to a loss.

The Group is engaged in a number of legal proceedings relating to patent and other claims under contracts.
The Group is vigorously defending these cases, the estimated cost of which is disclosed above, and the directors currently believe that the claims are unlikely to be settled for amounts resulting in material cash or other asset outflows.
Guarantees At 31 March 2005, the Group had provided third parties with a total of 137 million of guarantees, performance bonds and indemnities, the exercise of which is considered to be remote.
At 31 March 2005, the value of total collateral against these various guarantees was 78 million.
In addition, we estimate that 59 million of the providers had varying conditional and unconditional rights to call for cash collateral.

78 28 Financial instruments a Treasury policies and organisation The Groups treasury activities are coordinated by its central treasury function, which operates in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board.
It does not operate as a profit centre.
The treasury function advises operational management on treasury matters and undertakes all derivative transactions.
All treasury-related transactions undertaken by operating businesses are required to be carried out in accordance with guidelines laid down by the treasury function and must comply with the Group risk management policies.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all disclosures within this note with the exception of the currency related risk profile disclosures.
The main risks faced by the Group in the financial markets in the years ended 31 March 2005 and 2004 were liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and counter-party risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these, which are summarised below.
Financial instruments Prior to the Groups financial restructuring in May 2003, the Group used financial instruments, including derivatives principally interest rate swaps, cancellable interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage interest rate and currency risk exposures.
It is the Groups policy that there is no trading in financial instruments, and that all financial instruments are used solely for the purpose of financing or hedging identified exposures of the Group.
Liquidity risk The Group funded its activities mainly through cash generated from its operational activities and proceeds of disposals.
The Senior Notes were repaid in full in September 2004 265 million outstanding as at 31 March 2004.
The Groups gross borrowings as at 31 March 2005 were 37 million 2004: 305 million and cash and liquid resources were 334 million 2004: 519 million, resulting in net cash of 297 million at 31 March 2005 2004: 214 million.
In the years ended 31 March 2005 and 2004, the Group had local borrowing facilities in Italy and China.
The Group has not sought to increase or add to its bank facilities given its net cash and liquid resources position of 297 million as at 31 March 2005.
As disclosed in note 16, the Group has uncommitted receivables financing facilities for b79 million 54 million of which b22 million 15 million was drawn as at 31 March 2005.
The facilities do not have formal expiry dates, however, b19 million 13 million of these facilities is due for review in December 2005 and the remaining b60 million 41 million is due for review in March 2006.
The following table sets out the breakdown of restricted and free cash balances.
31 March 31 March 2005 2004 million million Cash collateral for performance bonds and guarantees 78 85 Captive insurance company 17 18 Collateral for secured loans 8 11 Mandatory Redemption Escrow Account MREA 10 Total restricted cash 103 124 Cash held at subsidiary level and cash in transit 64 74 Available treasury deposits 167 321 Cash at bank and in hand including liquid resources 334 519 The Group continues to be required to place cash collateral, in whole or in part, against any provision of performance bonding facilities or letters of credit.
As at 31 March 2005, 78 million of cash collateral was outstanding 2004: 85 million to secure 137 million of bonding 2004: 141 million.
Interest rate risk The Group repaid its fixed-rate US Dollar denominated debt the Loan Notes in full on 1 September 2004 and subsequently the Groups interest charge exposure was limited to floating-rate interest on RMB 153 million of loans in China 10 million, b3 million 2 million of leases in Italy and b7 million 5 million of debt in Italy.
b29 million 20 million of debt in Italy was at fixed-rate interest.
All the Italian borrowings are at rates sponsored by the Italian government.
The Groups cash and liquid resources of 334 million 2004: 519 million are all at floating rate.
A one-percentage point decrease in market interest rates would have decreased profit before taxation by 3 million in the year ended 31 March 2005.
The average rate of interest achieved on invested cash was approximately 2.7% per annum 2004: 2.0%.
79 Notes to the accounts continued 28 Financial instruments continued a Treasury policies and organisation continued Counter-party risk All deposits and foreign exchange forward contracts are made with creditworthy and authorised counter-parties.
The Groups counter-party risk to foreign currency hedging is weighted at 12.5% of gross exposure up to three months and added to deposit exposure weighted at 100%.
Exposure to any single financial counter-party is limited by policy as a proportion of the central treasury functions free cash deposits to a maximum of 25%.
Customer financing risks The Group has not issued any new customer finance commitments during the year ended 31 March 2005.
At 31 March 2005, the Group had a net exposure to customer financing of approximately 1 million.
In addition, the Group uses export credit agencies to assist in managing political and credit risks on major contracts, and makes use of export credit insurance in respect of small to medium-sized contracts when considered appropriate.
Contract bonding facilities The Group provides third parties with guarantees, performance bonds and indemnities, the exercise of which is considered to be remote.
At 31 March 2005 the amount outstanding was 137 million 2004: 141 million.
Marconi Bonding Limited, a Group subsidiary, has available to it a committed bonding facility for 35 million until November 2007.
Under the terms of the facility, Marconi Bonding Limited provides 50% cash collateral to the bonding provider: the provider has unconditional rights to call for the balance, up to 100% cash collateral, at any time.
This facility replaced a facility for 50 million which was due to expire in November 2005 and which required 100% cash collateral to be placed with the provider.
A maturity profile of all bonds and guarantees outstanding is set out below: Bonds Bonds outstanding outstanding at 31 March at 31 March 2005 2004 Expiring 31 March million million 2005 or earlier 51 2006 54 8 2007 57 58 2008 7 6 Thereafter 9 11 No expiry date 10 7 Total 137 141 At 31 March 2005 the value of total cash collateral against these various guarantees was 78 million.
The Group estimates that as at 31 March 2005, 59 million of the providers had varying conditional and unconditional rights to call for cash collateral.
Insurance risk management The Group manages centrally the purchase of global insurance policies in respect of major insurable risks, including property material damage business interruption, directors and officers and public liability.
The Group maintains the types of property and liability insurance which the directors regard as appropriate given the nature of the risks run in the course of its business, and for amounts which they consider adequate.
When considering the appropriateness of insurance cover, the directors make assessments of insurable risks using both in-house professionals and the advice of insurance brokers.
The directors have determined what they believe to be the appropriate level of cover having regard, among other things, to the Groups loss record, the industry in which it operates, its risk tolerance level, the cost of cover relative to the risk, customer and legal requirements and any relevant and available information on the levels of cover typically purchased by other comparable companies which operate in the Groups industry.
The use of global policies and centrally appointed brokers allows the Group to improve internal control and optimise the overall level of retained risk.
Risk management and insurance spend are concentrated on those insurable risks which are considered potentially catastrophic to the Group as a whole.
The Group continues to work with its insurers and advisors to improve its loss prevention and mitigation process.
80 28 Financial instruments continued a Treasury policies and organisation continued Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates against Sterling for both trading transactions and the translation of net assets and the profit and loss accounts of overseas subsidiaries.
The main trading currencies of the Group are the US Dollar, Sterling and the Euro.
In September 2004, the Group redeemed the remainder of its US Dollar-denominated debt 265 million.
The Groups cash and liquid resources were 334 million 2004: 519 million of which 138 million 2004: 111 million was denominated in Sterling, 35 million 2004: 262 million in US Dollars, 128 million 2004: 110 million in Euro and the balance of 33 million 2004: 36 million in other currencies.
As at 31 March 2005, the Group held approximately b78 million 54 million and $31 million 17 million of foreign-currency denominated cash within the UK, as a combination of collateral against bonding facilities and to meet foreign currency working capital requirements.
This cash is not treated as a hedge for accounting purposes, and gains and losses on retranslation of the cash into Sterling are taken to net finance income expenditure.
The Group has overseas subsidiaries that earn profits or incur losses in their local currencies.
It is not the Groups policy to hedge the exposures arising from the translation of these overseas results into Sterling.
The Groups sales and profitability are sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations.

In addition to the above, in December 2004 the Group entered into an arrangement to assign certain Euro-denominated trade debts as security against the advance of cash from a third party provider.
Debts outstanding at 31 March 2005 were b22 million 15 million 2004: nil.

Fair values for foreign exchange contracts are immaterial.
e Gain and losses on hedges In February 2005, the Group recommenced hedging of foreign currency cash flow exposures with maturity of three months or less from forecast date.
As at 31 March 2005, gross exposures totalling 22 million 2004: nil were hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts that were deemed to be 100% effective.
Unrealised gains and losses were considered to be immaterial.
29 Post balance sheet events On 28 April 2005, BT announced that Marconi had not been selected as a preferred supplier for its 21CN project.
Consequently Marconi has recognised the need to refocus its business and has undertaken a process of consultation with trade union and employee representatives on a proposed headcount reduction of up to 800 jobs in the UK.
In the year ending 31 March 2006, the Group expects the restructuring plan to achieve headcount and associated cost savings of approximately 36 million.
In addition, the Group has identified further business cost reduction and efficiency gains from other initiatives, some of which were commenced in the year ended 31 March 2005.
The restructuring cash costs are expected to be approximately 55 million including cash related to existing restructuring provisions.
Of these cash costs, the Group expects to incur approximately 45 million in the year ending 31 March 2006.
As a result the Group expects to achieve overall cost savings on an annualised basis of around 50 million.
Around one half of this amount is expected to be realised in the year ending 31 March 2006.
Excluding share of joint ventures.
Net monetary funds debt are as described in note 24 to the accounts.
Liabilities include retirement benefit scheme surpluses and deficits.
