21 DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Deferred income taxes are calculated on all temporary differences at the tax rate applicable to the jurisdiction in which the timing differences arise.
i Deferred tax asset The movement on the deferred tax asset account is as follows: m Income Foreign statement Charged Acquisition exchange & 1 January charge credited to disposals of other 31 December 2005 credit Equity subsidiaries movements 2005 Insurance funds 156 16 14 186 Tax losses carried forward 266 25 5 5 241 Accelerated capital allowances 1 14 80 95 Available-for-sale securities 8 4 4 Other temporary differences 25 11 5 79 60 440 6 24 458 m Income Foreign statement Charged Acquisition exchange & 1 January charge credited to disposals of other 31 December 2004 credit Equity subsidiaries movements 2004 Insurance funds 69 90 3 156 Tax loss carried forward 198 6 74 266 Accelerated capital allowances 1 1 Available-for-sale securities 8 8 Other temporary differences 291 13 2 277 25 559 97 2 214 440 In 2004, other movements in relation to other temporary timing differences included an adjustment of 169 million based on reclassification of deferred tax on structured finance transactions.

The Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates and interests in joint ventures and hence it is not required to recognise a deferred tax asset or liability in this respect.
In view of the variety of ways in which these temporary differences may reverse and the complexity of the tax law it is not possible to accurately compute the temporary differences arising from such investments.
However the key overseas jurisdictions in which Old Mutual operates have statutory rates of corporate tax in excess of the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30%.
Consequently it is expected that profits distributed from those countries would typically have a tax base at least equal to their carrying value.
