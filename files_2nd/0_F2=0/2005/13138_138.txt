Deferred taxation Under IFRS, deferred taxation is provided for nearly all differences between the balance sheet amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Under US GAAP, deferred taxation is provided on all temporary differences under the liability method subject to a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets where applicable, in accordance with SFAS109 Accounting for Income Taxes.
The most significant deferred tax differences between IFRS and US GAAP arise from the different carrying values in respect of pensions, goodwill and acquired intangible assets as described above.
The tax effect of these and other GAAP differences in carrying values is that net income under US GAAP is 27m a39m higher than reported under IFRS 2004: 81m a119m lower, and combined shareholders equity is 144m a210m lower than reported under IFRS 2004: 174m a246m lower.
A further difference arises on the recognition of deferred tax assets for share based remuneration, which, under IFRS, is calculated based on the intrinsic value of outstanding awards and which, under US GAAP, is determined based on the cumulative charge to
