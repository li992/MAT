87 Alliance UniChem Plc 28 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES BORROWINGS CONTINUED d Undrawn committed borrowing facilities The maturity profile of the Groups undrawn committed facilities at 31 December was: 2005 2004 million million Between one and two years 489.6 Between two and five years 126.6 489.6 126.6 The Group has financial covenants in respect of the committed bank facilities and the Senior notes.
These covenants relate to maintaining a minimum level of interest cover and not exceeding a defined level of gearing.
In respect of the Senior notes only, there is an additional covenant requiring the Group to limit the amount of subsidiary indebtedness when expressed as a percentage of Group equity.
The Group has complied with all covenants throughout the period.
29 SECURITISED RECEIVABLES a French and Italian schemes Receivables of 344.2 million 2004 343.2 million from French and Italian pharmacies have been securitised under five year programmes that mature in 2007.
Consistent with Group policy, the Group is not obliged to support any losses in respect of the amounts advanced under the securitisation arrangements.
The amounts advanced amounted to 292.7 million 2004 300.8 million.
The provider of these arrangements has agreed in writing that it will seek repayment of the finance as to both principal and interest only to the extent that sufficient funds are generated from the receivables discounted and that it will not seek recourse in any other form.
In respect of the Italian receivables, these have been sold to Alleanza No.
1 which in line with SIC 12 Consolidation Special purpose entities, has been determined to be controlled by the Group and consequently has been consolidated in the Group financial statements.
The French receivables have been sold to a multi-purpose vehicle which is not treated as a subsidiary under SIC 12 as it is not deemed to be controlled by the Group.
b UK scheme In 2001, the Group entered into a five year agreement to sell UK receivables to Alliance No.
Alliance has issued 100.0 million 2004 100.0 million secured notes to independent investors to finance the purchase of the receivables.
The Group has provided finance totalling 14.0 million 2004 12.9 million, which is subordinated, representing the excess of the face value of the receivables sold over the 100.0 million received.
The secured notes are serviceable only from the cash flows generated from the securitised receivables together with 14.0 million of finance provided by the Group 2004 12.9 million.
In accordance with SIC 12, Alliance has been determined to be controlled by the Group and consequently has been consolidated within these financial statements.
The Group exposure to any additional financial risks is judged to be negligible.
The maturity profile of the Groups financing linked to securitisation at 31 December 2005 was: France Italy UK 2005 securitisation securitisation securitisation Total million million million million Within one year 189.4 100.0 289.4 Between one and two years 103.3 103.3 189.4 103.3 100.0 392.7 30 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation disclosures IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards allows a number of exceptions to the general principle that IFRS accounting policies are to be applied retrospectively.
One of the exceptions adopted by the Group is to apply IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 January 2005.
Whilst not required, the Group has provided certain disclosure information on derivative financial instruments at 1 January 2005 in order to aid comparison with the 2005 year end disclosures.
The 2004 comparative disclosures are prepared under UK GAAP, specifically FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments, and the second part of this note provides the disclosure information required.
88 Alliance UniChem Plc Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 30 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation disclosures continued a Book and fair value of financial instruments A comparison of book values and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2005 is set out below: Carrying Fair value value million million Financial assets Non-current assets Available-for-sale investments 48.4 48.4 Trade and other receivables 27.2 27.2 Derivative financial instruments 3.5 3.5 Current assets Trade and other receivables 1,424.7 1,424.7 Cash and cash equivalents 133.5 133.5 Derivative financial instruments 0.6 0.6 Financial liabilities Current liabilities Financial liabilities borrowings 216.4 216.4 financing linked to securitisation 289.4 289.4 Derivative financial instruments 12.2 12.2 Trade and other payables 1,383.5 1,383.5 Non-current liabilities Financial liabilities borrowings 605.2 624.3 financing linked to securitisation 103.3 103.3 derivative financial instruments 83.4 83.4 With the exception of the Senior notes classified within non-current borrowings, the fair value of the financial assets and financial liabilities approximate to the carrying value.
The fair value of the Senior notes is calculated using discounted cash flow methodology, based on third party estimates of the Groups credit spread above the benchmark swap curve.
The fair value of the Senior notes is 479.3 million.
The fair value of borrowings and financing linked to securitisation approximate to the carrying value due to either their short-term nature or being priced at variable interest rates.
Available-for-sale investments and derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value.
The fair values of derivative instruments have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows of the individual contracts using the appropriate market interest rate curve and foreign currency rate.
b Currency and interest rate risk The Groups approach to managing financial risk is described in the financial review.
Currency risk The Group has foreign currency net investments denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Norwegian Kroner and Czech Koruna.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, specifically cross-currency swaps, and foreign currency borrowings to hedge the foreign currency risk.
The effect of currency-swaps on borrowings is shown below: Before After hedging hedging million million Borrowings at 31 December 2005 Sterling 116.5 42.4 Euro 280.8 838.2 Czech Koruna 29.5 29.5 Norwegian Kroner 7.9 11.6 Swiss Franc 76.2 US Dollar 386.9 821.6 913.1 The after-hedging currency borrowings are used to hedge the Groups foreign currency net investments.
In addition, the Group has Sterling denominated financial liabilities of 100.0 million and Euro denominated financial liabilities of 292.7 million relating to financing linked to securitisation.
There are no significant unmatched currency exposures on monetary assets and liabilities after taking into account the effects of currency swaps and forward exchange contracts.
89 Alliance UniChem Plc 30 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation disclosures continued b Currency and interest rate risk continued Interest rate risk The Group has a mixture of fixed and floating rate borrowings.
Of these, 475.5 million 58.0% is at fixed interest rates which predominantly relates to the Senior notes, and 346.1 million 42.0% is at floating interest rates.
The re-pricing risk of the Senior notes coincides with their maturity, which is provided in note 28.
The floating rate borrowings re-price within three months of the reporting date based on short-term LIBOR rates for the relevant currency.
The fixed rate Senior notes have been swapped to floating interest rates using derivative financial instruments, specifically cross-currency interest rate swaps for their remaining life.
The Group hedges the cash flow interest rate exposure resulting from floating rate borrowings, financing linked to securitisation and cross-currency swaps through the use of interest rate swaps.
At 31 December 2005 the weighted average rate of pay fixed interest rate swaps was as follows: Weighted average Notional % million Sterling 5.7 20.0 Euro 3.6 327.0 Norwegian Kroner 6.6 10.0 The gains or losses deferred in equity relating to cash flow hedges will reverse in the income statement during the next two years being the life of the swaps.
The interest rate profile of the Groups borrowings and financing linked to securitisation, after taking into account derivative financial instruments, was as follows: At fixed At floating interest rates interest rates Total million million million Sterling 61.2 3.6 57.6 Euro 270.4 860.6 1,131.0 Czech Koruna 29.5 29.5 Norwegian Kroner 9.9 1.6 11.5 Swiss Franc 76.2 76.2 341.5 964.3 1,305.8 The following table shows the impact on the fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities of a 1% increase in interest rates and a 10% change in the value of Sterling: 1% increase 10% in interest weakening Fair value rates of Sterling million million million Cash at bank and in hand 133.5 5.4 Borrowings 821.6 24.5 78.3 Interest rate swaps 0.4 0.7 Cross-currency interest rate swaps 91.1 16.3 23.4 Financing linked to securitisation 392.7 32.5 c Derivative financial instruments Hedge accounting Achieving hedge accounting under IAS 32 and IAS 39 is based on measuring the effectiveness of the derivative as a hedge instrument as well as fulfilling hedge documentation rules.
The effectiveness test compares the change in the fair value of the designated derivative and the change in the fair value of the hedged item, to determine if this ratio falls within the permitted range of 80% to 125%.
Any derivative that falls outside the permitted range is reclassified as held-for-trading.
Gains or losses on the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement except where the derivative is designated within an effective cash flow or net investment hedge relationship, in which case the gains or losses are deferred in equity and are recycled through the income statement at the time that the hedged item is recognised in the income statement.
The hedge accounting treatment is described further under accounting policies, derivative financial instruments.
Where a derivative does fall within the permitted range but is not 100% effective, the ineffective element is recognised in the income statement immediately.
This gives rise to a gain or loss which is recognised under Finance income or Finance costs as appropriate.
These gains or losses represent timing differences that will reverse over the life of the financial instruments.

The derivatives are classified as current or non-current in accordance with their maturity date.
The Groups risk management policy is to take out hedging instruments to cover actual interest rate or foreign currency risks.
The Groups policy is not to engage in speculative transactions.
Where a derivative in whole or in part cannot be designated to an underlying transaction or the hedge relationship falls outside the permitted effectiveness range, any gain or loss arising on the undesignated portion of a derivative is recognised in the income statement immediately.
This could arise from temporary timing differences for example, early closure of the underlying exposure or differences between the timing or fair value of the hedged item compared to the derivative.
Those derivative instruments or portions thereof that are not designated in a hedging relationship are classified as held-for-trading.
The Group transacts derivatives with counterparties that are highly rated by international credit rating agencies.
These ratings are continually monitored.
91 Alliance UniChem Plc 30 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED UK GAAP disclosures of comparative information As noted, the Group has taken up the option to only apply IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 January 2005.
The 2004 comparative disclosures are prepared under previous UK GAAP, and the following provides the information required under FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments for the interest rate profile for financial assets and liabilities and hedge accounting.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from this note other than the currency profile of monetary assets and liabilities.
a Book and fair value of financial instruments A comparison of book values and fair values of the Groups primary financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2004 is set out below: Book Fair value value million million Cash at bank and in hand 101.9 101.9 Loans to associated undertakings 42.5 42.5 Other listed investments 40.8 44.7 Other unlisted investments 1.8 1.8 Debtors due after one year 40.2 40.2 Financial assets 227.2 231.1 Bank overdrafts 82.1 82.1 Bank loans 249.0 249.0 Loan notes 409.8 444.3 Obligations under finance leases 16.2 16.2 Total debt 757.1 791.6 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate and currency profile interest rate derivatives 7.1 cross currency derivatives 150.6 136.9 Financial liabilities 907.7 935.6 The fair values of fixed asset investments and interest rate and currency derivatives are based on market value.
The fair values of the Senior notes are calculated using discounted cash flow methodology, based on third party estimates of the Groups credit spread above the benchmark swap curve.
The fair value of all other financial instruments is approximately equal to book value due to either their short-term nature or their being at variable interest rates.
b Interest rate risk profile The interest rate profile of financial assets and liabilities, after taking into account interest rate and currency derivative contracts, was as follows: At fixed At floating Non-interest interest rates interest rates bearing Total million million million million 2004 financial assets Sterling 49.8 0.2 50.0 Euro 73.4 47.5 120.9 Other 2.3 52.5 1.5 56.3 2.3 175.7 49.2 227.2 Floating rate financial assets mainly comprise bank deposits and loans to associated undertakings which bear interest based on London inter-bank reference rates.

In addition to the amounts detailed, the Group had Sterling denominated floating financial liabilities of 100.0 million and Euro denominated floating financial liabilities of 300.8 million relating to non-recourse securitised receipts.
At the outset of the UK securitisation programme, the Group swapped the Sterling non-recourse receipts to repay Euro denominated debt.
These swaps and other short-term swaps used to convert Sterling cash to Euros to repay Euro denominated debt, are shown in the table above.
They are all on a floating rate basis.
The Group had further Euro denominated derivative financial instruments to hedge securitisation costs that varied according to interest rates, totalling 98.8 million.
These instruments had a weighted average interest rate of 3.9% which was fixed for a weighted average period of 1.8 years.
Floating rate financial liabilities mainly comprise bank overdrafts, loans and loan notes predominantly bearing interest at margins over London inter-bank reference rates.
c Hedging Under UK GAAP, gains and losses on instruments used for hedging were not recognised until the exposure that was being hedged was itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on hedging instruments, and movements thereof, were as follows: Gains Losses Total million million million At 1 January 2004 25.5 14.8 10.7 Arising in previous years that were recognised in the year 16.0 6.8 9.2 Arising before 1 January that were not recognised in the year 9.5 8.0 1.5 Arising in the year that were not recognised in the year 7.7 2.6 5.1 At 31 December 2004 17.2 10.6 6.6 Of which expected to be recognised: in 2005 7.3 6.5 0.8 after 2005 9.9 4.1 5.8 A comparison of book and fair values of the Groups derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2004 is set out below: Book value Fair value million million Interest rate derivatives 7.1 Cross-currency derivatives 150.6 136.9
