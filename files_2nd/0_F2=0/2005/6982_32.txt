Options are capable of exercise after three years and within ten years of the date of grant.
Those granted since November 2001 are subject to Total Shareholder Return performance targets, except for those issued to all employees on a formula basis on achieving their six month anniversary with the Group.

The option price is based on the market price on the day preceding grant and there is no discount.
Options are generally exercisable after three years, but the plan does allow for variable vesting, and within ten years.
Performance conditions are not normally imposed on US share options except for PLC Board Directors.
The Gyrus Group Qualifying Non-Employee Stock Option Plan is a plan approved by shareholders in 2002 to enable Gyrus to grant share options, within strict guidelines, to independent sales people, consultants and members of the scientific advisory panel.
The option price is the market price on the day preceding grant and there is no discount.

Options are exercisable after three years and within ten years.
The Save As You Earn Scheme is a scheme under which UK employees can enter into savings contracts with a building society for a period of three or five years and use the proceeds of their savings account to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of options.

The fair value of grants under this scheme are determined as being the mid market quote on the day preceding grant which is charged to the income statement evenly over the three year vesting period.
Details of options granted to Directors and the share price ranges in the year are given in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 42.
