This has increased the IFRS net assets and reduced the value of the tax assets in the PVIF.
The main components of the operating assumption changes are the increases in insurance contract liability provisions due to changes in the mortality, morbidity and expense assumptions.
These were allowed for in the 2004 EEV PVIF and have resulted in a transfer from PVIF to net assets this year.
V. EUROPEAN EMBEDDED VALUE SENSITIVITIES The table below shows the estimated impact on the combined life and unit trust reported value of new business and EEV to changes in various EEV calculated assumptions.

Note 3: As a market-consistent approach is used, equity expected returns only affect the derived discount rates and not the embedded value or contribution to profit from new business.
