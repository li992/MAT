22 Pensions and similar obligations Description of plans In many countries the Group operates dened benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
The majority of these plans are externally funded.
The Group also provides other post-employment benets, mainly post-employment medical plans in the United States.
These plans are predominantly unfunded.
The Group also operates a number of dened contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds.
Accounting policies Operating and nancing costs of dened benefit plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are systematically spread over the service lives of employees, and nancing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The costs of individual events such as past service benefit enhancements, settlements and curtailments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The liabilities and, where applicable, the assets of dened benefit plans are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet.
The fair value of plan liabilities includes allowance for expected increases in retirement pensions where these are either required by law or by the plan rules, or where such increases are regularly awarded.
The charges to the income statement for dened contribution plans are the company contributions payable and the assets of such plans are not included in the Group balance sheet.
All dened benefit plans are subject to regular actuarial review using the projected unit method, either by external consultants or by actuaries employed by Unilever.
Group policy is that the most important plans, representing over 75% of the dened benefit liabilities, are formally valued every year: other principal plans, accounting for approximately a further 15% of liabilities, have their liabilities updated each year.
Group policy for the remaining plans requires a full actuarial valuation at least every three years.
Asset values for all plans are updated every year.
Healthcare In December 2003 the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernisation Act became law in the US.
Under the provisions of this Act, the Groups US healthcare benefit plans are able to benefit from a subsidy towards the cost of prescription drugs.
Following a review of our healthcare plans in 2004, we determined that the benets of this legislation were immediately available to all except one of our plans without any amendment to those plans.
During 2005 it has been established that the remaining plan also benets.
As a consequence, a reduction in liability of 52 million was recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense in 2004 and a further 13 million in 2005.
The impact on the ongoing service cost is a reduction by an immaterial amount.
