41 Capital and leasing commitments The Company had no capital or leasing commitments at 31 December 2005 or 31 December 2004.
42 Contingent liabilities Royal Bank of Scotland plc has issued, on behalf of Marshalls plc, irrevocable letters of credit of 900,000 and 600,000 in respect of the Groups employers liability insurance cover with Mistui Sumitomo Insurance London Management Limited.
These sums relate to the Groups cap on self insurance in relation to the 12 months ended 31 October 2004 and 31 October 2005 respectively.
The Company has not adopted amendments to IAS 39 or IFRS 4 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which will apply for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2006.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the Financial Statements for the period commencing 1 January 2006.
"43 Pension scheme The Company is a member of the Marshalls plc Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the ""Scheme"" which has both a defined benefit and a defined contribution section."
The assets of the Scheme are held in separately managed funds which are independent of the Groups finances.
Full details of the Scheme are provided in Note 18.
It is not practical for the Company to identify its share of the Scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis.
"Accordingly, as permitted by FRS 17, ""Retirement benefits"", the Scheme has been accounted for in these Company Financial Statements as if the Scheme was a defined contribution scheme."
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2003 and was updated for FRS 17 purposes to 31 December 2005 by a qualified independent Actuary.
Certain employees are members of a company defined contribution scheme which invests funds in which the contributions for each individual member are separately identifiable and the benefits calculated accordingly.
