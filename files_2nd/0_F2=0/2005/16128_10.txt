At 1 January 2006, the review was undertaken on a value in use basis, assessing whether the carrying value of goodwill was supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from those assets, using cash flow projections in respect of periods to 2010 discounted at 6.95% 2004: 7.37%.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, revenue and costs growth rates and the level of capital expenditure required during the period.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recently approved annual budgets and the three-year strategic and capital expenditure plans of the relevant businesses.
The cash flow forecasts reflect the risk associated with each asset.
Cash flows for years beyond 2010 are extrapolated based on estimated growth rates which do not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets.

The review of the carrying value of the Groups publishing rights and titles, undertaken in accordance with IAS 38, has indicated that no impairment charge was required 2004: nil million as the net present value of future cash flows to be derived from these assets discounted at 6.95% 2004: 7.37% is greater than the carrying value.
The customer relationships and domain names included above have finite estimated useful lives of between five and ten years.
The carrying value of other intangible assets analysed by business segment is as follows: 2005 2004 m m Regionals 924.0 887.8 Nationals 647.0 647.0 Sports 42.8 42.8 Magazines and Exhibitions 2.3 2.3 1,616.1 1,579.9 In accordance with accounting standards, the Group annually tests the carrying value of other intangible assets with indefinite economic lives for impairment.
At 1 January 2006, the review was undertaken using a combination of value in use and business valuations to assess whether the carrying value of publishing rights and titles, customer relationships and domain names was supported either by the net present value of future cash flows derived from those assets, using cash flow projections in respect of periods to 2054, or by managements estimate of the valuation of the intangible assets based on previous market transactions in the sector.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and the level of capital expenditure required during the period.
The discount rate used at 1 January 2006 was 6.95% reflecting a long-term equity and debt mix based on the year-end Enterprise Value assuming a long-term debt to EBITDA ratio of three times.
The cash flow forecasts reflect past experience of and the risk associated with each asset.
Operating cash flows beyond the three-year strategic plan period are extrapolated based on estimated growth rates which do not exceed the average long-term growth estimated for the relevant markets.
Investment cash flows have been forecast to reflect the cycle of capital investment required, including printing press replacement.
Management believes it is appropriate to forecast for a period of greater than five years to most appropriately reflect the length of the capital investment cycle.

The US and UK private placement loan notes totalling US$602 million and 32 million were issued in 2001 and 2002.
The fixed rate interest and capital repayments on the US$ denominated loan notes have been swapped into floating rate sterling through the use of cross-currency interest rate swaps to manage the Groups exposure to currency and interest rate movements.
As hedge accounting under IAS 39 has not been applied, the loan notes and cross-currency swaps are shown separately under IAS 39.
The loan notes are disclosed at amortised cost and translated into sterling at the prevailing period-end exchange rate and the cross-currency swaps are disclosed at fair value at the period-end date.
These values do not represent the amounts required to repay the loan notes or cancel the related cross-currency interest rate swaps.
Comparative periods for the loan notes are disclosed and measured based on UK GAAP as at 2 January 2005.
The difference between the UK GAAP comparatives and IFRS is that under UK GAAP the loan notes were hedged against the related swaps and not restated from US dollars to sterling at the balance sheet date.
All borrowings are denominated in sterling unless otherwise indicated.
At 1 January 2006 the Group had available 222.4 million 2004: 263.1 million of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
The effective interest rates at the balance sheet dates were as follows: 2005 2004 % % Bank overdrafts 5.65 5.40 US$ loan notes 6.66 6.19 loan notes 7.06 6.85 Finance leases 6.86 7.15 The directors estimate the fair value of the Groups borrowings, by discounting their future cash flows at the market rate, to be as follows: 2005 2004 m m Bank overdrafts, short-term loans and commercial loan notes 58.7 36.4 US$ loan notes 362.8 338.5 loan notes 33.0 33.0 Finance leases 18.4 20.2 In estimating the fair value of the loan notes the directors have discounted the future cash flows using the credit ratings applied at the dates of inception, which they believe to be appropriate discount factors.
The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities excluding derivative financial instruments see note 27 are not materially different from the book values and are not repeated in this analysis.

The adjustment separated the foreign exchange component of the crosscurrency interest rate swaps from the value of the private placement loans which were previously recorded at the swap contract exchange rate under UK GAAP.
Under an exemption permitted within IFRS 1 the comparative periods have not been restated.
Comparative periods are disclosed and measured based on UK GAAP as at 2 January 2005.
Under UK GAAP at 2 January 2005 the swaps and their underlying loan notes were accounted for using hedge accounting whereas under IFRS they are disclosed separately at fair value.

The fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps at 1 January 2006 is estimated at 56.6 million 2 January 2005: 87.2 million.
These amounts have been calculated using an industry-standard financial instrument model.
The Group does not currently designate its cross-currency interest rate swaps as hedging instruments and changes in the fair values of the swaps have been charged to the income statement in the year.

However, following the introduction of the Long Term Incentive Plan in 2004 no further options have been granted under this scheme.
Options are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant subject to the continued employment of the participant, and achievement of earnings per share performance.
In addition, 50% of each grant of an option to each individual is subject to a total shareholder return comparison against the FTSE Mid-250 index of companies on the date of grant.
The other 50% is subject to a comparison of total shareholder return with a group of about 20 other media companies.
No vesting of options is to take place unless the Companys ranking is at least median.

The inputs to the model were as follows: Options granted 28 February 7 August 2003 2003 Expected volatility 27% 28% Expected life years 66 Expected dividend yield 4.42% 3.56% Risk free rate 3.9% 4.2% Expected volatility has been determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over a period prior to grant that is commensurate with the length of the expected life of the option.
The expected life of the options used in the model is a weighted average driven by simulated share price movements in the model.
Long Term Incentive Plan Under this scheme, which was first introduced in 2004, the Remuneration Committee can recommend the grant of awards of shares to any eligible employee.
Awards may take the form of either Performance Shares or Matching Shares.
Full details of how the scheme operates are explained on page 49 in the Remuneration Report.
The vesting of Performance Shares is conditional upon the achievement of two performance conditions.
Up to 50% of an award can vest provided that earnings per share growth exceeds a range of targets above inflation.
The remaining 50% vests if targets measuring the Companys total shareholder return against the performance of a comparator group of companies are met.
Movements in Performance Shares and Matching Shares during the period are as follows: 2005 2004 Performance Matching Performance Matching Awards outstanding as at start of period 679,813 355,748 Granted during the period 707,249 228,317 751,927 380,248 Lapsed during the period 19,221 16,843 72,114 24,500 Awards outstanding as at end of period 1,367,841 567,222 679,813 355,748 The estimated fair value of the Performance Share and Matching Share awards are as follows: 2005 2004 Performance Shares 3,494,901 3,059,235 Matching Shares 1,469,266 1,881,075 91 Chairmans statement Chief Executives statement Business review Corporate responsibility Board of Directors and Executive Committee Corporate governance Remuneration report Directors report Group independent auditors report Accounts and notes Unaudited other information Holding company accounts and notes Investor Relations 33 Share-based payments continued These fair values were calculated using a stochastic model.

As the awards vest three years from the date of grant the expected term is three years for both Performance and Matching Shares.
The Group recognised total expenses of 4.4 million 2004: 1.9 million related to share-based payment transactions during the period.
34 Retirement benefit schemes Defined benefit schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes.
Two of the schemes, namely the Mirror Group Pension Scheme the Old Scheme and the MGN Past Service Pension Scheme the Past Service Scheme cover the liabilities in respect of service up to 13 February 1992, the date when the Old Scheme was closed.
The Past Service Scheme was established to meet the liabilities for service up to 13 February 1992 for employees and former employees who worked regularly on the production and distribution of Mirror Groups newspapers, which are not satisfied by payments from the Old Scheme and the Maxwell Communications Pension Plan or by the State.
These Schemes have formal actuarial valuations carried out regularly.
The actuarial methods and assumptions used to calculate their assets and liabilities vary according to actuarial and funding policies adjusted by the Trustees.
The last formal valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2004 and showed that the Schemes have insufficient assets to meet their liabilities for members benefits.
In anticipation of this, agreement was reached with the Trustees to pay 9.0 million in the Past Service Scheme in 2005 2004: 3.5 million.
For 2006, agreement has been reached with the Trustees to pay 12.5 million.
The next full actuarial valuation is due to be carried out as at 31 December 2007.
In addition to the above schemes, the Group operates a further eight final salary schemes.
Formal valuations of schemes are carried out regularly, the actuarial methods and assumptions used to calculate each schemes assets and liabilities varying according to the actuarial and funding policies adopted by their respective trustees.
The most significant of the schemes are the Trinity Retirement Benefit Scheme the Trinity Scheme, the MGN Pension Scheme the MGN Scheme and the Midland Independent Newspapers Pension Scheme the MIN Scheme, which together with the Old Scheme and the Past Service Scheme represent over 95% of the aggregate market value.
The last formal valuation of these schemes was undertaken on 30 June 2003 for the Trinity Scheme, 31 March 2004 for the MIN Scheme and 31 December 2004 for the MGN Scheme.
These valuations showed deficits of 25.1 million, 30.8 million and 55.9 million respectively.
All of the schemes are being funded in accordance with the recommendations of the respective actuaries.
In 2005, the employers contribution rate to the MGN Scheme was 11.1%.
However, this will increase in 2006 to 12%.
The employers contribution rate to the Trinity Scheme remained at 14% in 2005.
The employers contribution rate to the MIN Scheme increased by 1% to 15% in 2005.
During 2002, the decision was taken to close entry to these three defined benefit final salary pension schemes to new employees with effect from 1 January 2003.
All new employees are entitled to participate in a defined contribution plan, the Trinity Mirror Pension Plan.
Valuations have been performed in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 with scheme liabilities calculated using a consistent projected unit valuation method and compared to the market value of the schemes assets at 30 December 2005, the last day prior to the period end for which such values were available.

If the acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial period, Group revenues for the period would have been 1,170.4 million and Group operating profit would have been 249.1 million.
The initial accounting for acquisitions has not been finalised, due to uncertainties regarding the valuation of acquired liabilities and provisions at the acquisition date.
These uncertainties are expected to be resolved within one year of the date of each acquisition.
37 Explanation of transition to IFRS This is the first period that the Group has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The following disclosures are required in the period of transition.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the 53 weeks ended 2 January 2005 and the date of transition to IFRS was therefore 29 December 2003.
Differences between IFRS and UK GAAP Presentation IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements The presentation format of IFRS is different from UK GAAP and the illustrative financial information herein is designed to assist the reader to understand these changes.
Dividends IAS 10, Events After the Balance Sheet Date Dividends proposed will be disclosed as a Non-adjusting Event after the Balance Sheet Date under IAS 10, Events after the Balance Sheet Date.
Under IFRS dividends are not recognised as liabilities IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets until they are appropriately approved and are no longer at the discretion of the directors.
Accordingly the 2004 proposed dividend amount under UK GAAP is removed from the IFRS accounts.
Capitalised Leases IAS 17, Leases This standard has a wider scope than UK GAAP and has resulted in a small number of short leasehold buildings being capitalised on the Balance Sheet.
97 Chairmans statement Chief Executives statement Business review Corporate responsibility Board of Directors and Executive Committee Corporate governance Remuneration report Directors report Group independent auditors report Accounts and notes Unaudited other information Holding company accounts and notes Investor Relations 37 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Employee Option and Performance Share Schemes IFRS 2, Share-based Payments All transactions within the scope of IFRS 2 are valued based on the fair value of the option or award at grant date and expensed to the Income Statement over the vesting period of the scheme.
Pension costs IAS 19, Employee Benefits The main difference between IFRS and UK GAAP is the measurement of scheme assets.
The IFRS valuation is determined at bid rather than midmarket price thus increasing the Groups pension scheme liabilities.
In addition, there is a presentational difference with the pension scheme liability now being shown gross of its deferred tax asset.
Holiday pay IAS 19, Employee Benefits IAS 19 requires the recording of a holiday pay accrual.
This has been included in the opening IFRS Balance Sheet at 29 December 2003.
Although it is expected that this adjustment will be relatively stable in magnitude from one year to another, when comparing the year end and interim periods there is a balance sheet movement and income statement impact.
Goodwill IAS 38, Intangible Assets Under IAS 38 goodwill is not amortised.
Instead it is subject to an annual impairment review.
An adjustment has been made to remove the goodwill amortisation charge.
Associates IAS 28, Investments in Associates IFRS requires the share of profit of Associates to be shown post tax IAS 1.
Under UK GAAP this amount is shown before tax with the tax charge included as part of the Group tax charge.
Deferred Tax IAS 12, Income Taxes IAS 12 requires a deferred tax liability to be recognised on all temporary timing differences.
A potential liability arises from the difference between the fair value attributed to publishing rights and titles from previous acquisitions.
As the Group has elected, under IFRS 1, not to restate prior acquisitions at transition date to an IFRS 3 basis then recognition is against equity reserves rather than against goodwill.
Also included in this adjustment is the liability for gains deferred by rollover and held-over relief.
Cash flow The differences between UK GAAP and IFRS cash flows relate to the reclassification of some of the Groups UK GAAP operating lease payments as finance lease payments under IFRS and the IAS 19 finance costs not charged to the Groups income statement under UK GAAP.
There is no impact on the final cash position nor the movement in the period.
The IFRS cash flow with comparative information is presented on page 62.
The reconciliations of equity and profit below, together with the explanations of the changes, are provided to facilitate the understanding of changes arising from the adoption of IFRS.

Adoption of IAS 32 and 39 Reconciliation of equity at 3 January 2005 from opening position to post IAS 32 and 39 adoption The Group adopted IAS 32 and 39 on 3 January 2005 as permitted under the exemptions of IFRS 1.
The impact was limited to the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets to fair value from historical cost and accounting for the Groups private placement loan notes and associated crosscurrency interest rate swaps, which are brought onto the balance sheet at fair value.
Under UK GAAP these were treated as a hedge and the related borrowings were recorded at the future swaps exchange rate.
IAS 39 has specific accounting rules for the treatment of hedges previously accounted for under UK GAAP, which on adoption of the Standard are not accounted for using hedge accounting on an ongoing basis under IFRS.
The related borrowings are now recognised at an adjusted amortised cost.
This adjustment arises from the adoption date recognition rules where the opening position is recognised as an accounting hedge.
Subsequent measurements will not be under IAS 39 hedge accounting rules but instead will amortise the adjusted cost at the effective interest rate.
