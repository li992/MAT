The supplier is claiming damages for alleged failure on the part of the subsidiary to comply with the terms of certain contracts.
The directors are of the opinion that this matter can be settled, without a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the group.
Additional information required to be disclosed by IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, is not disclosed on the grounds that it can be expected to prejudice the outcome of the matter.
The company has a contingent liability for guarantees given in respect of the borrowing facilities of certain subsidiaries to a maximum of 748.6m 2004 494.1m.
At 31 December 2005 the borrowings under these facilities amounted to 586.6m 2004 393.5m.
No loss is expected to arise.

continued 32 Reconciliations between IFRS and UK GAAP group continued The principal differences for the group between reporting on the basis of UK GAAP and IFRS in the consolidated financial statements are as follows: 32 a Reclassifications The following reclassifications have been made within the consolidated income statement and the consolidated balance sheet on transition from UK GAAP to IFRS: Commissions paid to reinsurers were deducted from the revenue of the insurance division under UK GAAP.
In accordance with IFRS 4, these costs are now included within operating costs.
Under UK GAAP, interest payable by the group and investment income receivable by the insurance division was included in cost of sales and not separately disclosed on the face of the income statement.
In accordance with IAS 1, these amounts are now separately disclosed as finance costs interest payable and finance income investment income receivable.
The group has reclassified certain costs between operating costs formerly cost of sales under UK GAAP and administrative expenses to better reflect the current structure of the group.
In the home credit businesses and Vanquis Bank, operating costs comprise impairment charges, agents commission and advertising and marketing costs.
Operating costs for Yes Car Credit include the aforementioned costs plus the vehicle cost and costs of running the branch network.
For the insurance division, operating costs comprise claims costs, reinsurance costs and direct levies.
All other costs are classed as administrative expenses.
The UK GAAP deferred tax provision has been reclassified to deferred income tax assets as the group is now in a deferred income tax asset position following the transition to IFRS.
Computer software costs were disclosed as part of property, plant and equipment under UK GAAP.
Such costs meet the definition of intangible assets under IFRS and are therefore disclosed as intangible assets.
Given that the group has elected to retain UK GAAP carrying values of property, plant and equipment including any historic revaluations as deemed cost on the date of transition to IFRS, there is no difference between cost and valuation on an IFRS basis.
Accordingly, the UK GAAP revaluation reserve has been transferred from other reserves to retained earnings.
Treasury shares and foreign exchange movements taken to reserves formed part of retained earnings under UK GAAP.
Under IFRS, these amounts have been recategorised as part of other reserves.
As permitted by the transitional arrangements of IFRS 1, only foreign exchange differences taken to retained earnings after 1 January 2004 have been recategorised.
Certain trade and other payables, previously held as due in greater than one year under UK GAAP, have been reclassified to current liabilities to reflect the fact that they are due within the groups normal operating cycle.
32 b Revenue and impairment Revenue and impairment in home credit The service charge on a home credit loan is fixed.
The charge does not increase if customers take longer than the contracted period to repay the loan and there are no penalty or default interest charges.
Therefore, revenue is capped at the amount of the service charge.
Under UK GAAP, revenue in home credit was recognised by a combination of i an initial release to cover issue costs, ii an amount recognised in proportion to cash collections and iii a small amount released on a sum of digits method reflecting the funding cost of the amount advanced.
Under IFRS, the group is required to treat the service charge as if it were interest.
Revenue on loan receivables is recognised using an effective interest rate EIR.
This is calculated using contracted cash flows adjusted for the impact of customers repaying early but excluding the anticipated impact of customers paying late or not paying at all.
Directly attributable issue costs are also taken into account.
Under IFRS the group recognises revenue more slowly as many of the costs covered by the initial release under UK GAAP do not qualify as directly attributable costs under IFRS.
Under UK GAAP, bad debt provisions in home credit were based on a formulaic approach which was based on historical performance.
Under IFRS, impairment of the balance sheet value of customer receivables is calculated by estimating the future cash flows from a loan portfolio, discounting these to a present value using the EIR and comparing this figure with the balance sheet value.
An impairment provision is made for the shortfall between the present value and the balance sheet value and an impairment charge or credit to the income statement results.
Under UK GAAP, during the life of the loan, revenue was not accrued if collections were not made and a bad debt charge had arisen.
Under IFRS, revenue continues to be accrued even if payments are missed and an impairment charge is made.
This approach can, and does, result in the recognition of revenue in excess of the amount to which the group is contractually entitled because revenue continues to be recognised on loans that are not fully repaid within the contracted term.
The recognition of revenue above that which the group is contractually entitled to causes an immediate impairment charge since no cash collection is expected.
This results in a grossing up of the impairment charge which goes to offset the grossing up of the revenue.

Under IFRS, annual fees are recognised over the expected life of the outstanding balance using the EIR.
There is no material change to the recognition of other types of revenue within Vanquis Bank on transition to IFRS.
There is no material change in the bad debt provisioning policy of Vanquis Bank on transition to IFRS.
Revenue and impairment in Yes Car Credit Under UK GAAP, the proceeds from a vehicle sale were recognised immediately, together with a proportion of the insurance commission income.
The remainder of the insurance commission was recognised over the life of the finance contract.
Finance income was recognised over the life of the contract to give a constant return on the carrying amount.
Under IFRS, the car sale continues to be recognised immediately and finance income is recognised using the EIR.
Insurance commissions are taken into account in calculating the EIR and are therefore recognised over the life of the contract albeit not on a straight line basis.
Under UK GAAP, bad debt provisions in Yes Car Credit reflected the directors best estimate of the number of contracts likely to default and the average expected loss for these contracts.
Under IFRS, impairment is recognised when there is objective evidence that a loan is impaired e. g. when a contractual payment has been missed.
Provisions are calculated using the expected cash flows of impaired loans and discounted at the EIR.
32 c Goodwill Under UK GAAP, goodwill was recorded at cost and amortised to the profit and loss account over its expected useful economic life.
Goodwill amortisation is prohibited under IFRS.
Instead, annual impairment reviews of goodwill are conducted and any impairment is reflected in the income statement.
The adjustment included in the reconciliations reflects the reversal of the UK GAAP goodwill amortisation charge since the date of transition to IFRS.
32 d Retirement benefits Under UK GAAP, the group used SSAP 24 to account for pension obligations.
Under SSAP 24, the annual charge to the profit and loss account reflected the total cost of providing pensions including actuarial gains and losses spread over the working lives of employees.
Differences between cash contributions made to the scheme and the pension charge in the profit and loss account were held on the balance sheet.
Under IFRS, the accounting for defined benefit pension schemes is balance sheet focused with pension deficits surpluses recognised on the balance sheet.
There are a number of alternative treatments of actuarial gains and losses under IAS 19 the group has reflected such gains and losses in a statement of recognised income and expense rather than amortising them through the income statement.
This approach is similar to that of FRS 17 which is effective under UK GAAP from 1 January 2005.
The income statement adjustments reflect the difference between the UK GAAP SSAP 24 charge and the IAS 19 charge.
The balance sheet adjustment represents the reversal of the UK GAAP pension prepayment and full recognition of the pension deficit under IFRS.
The deferred tax asset on the pension deficit has been reflected separately from the pension deficit as IFRS does not allow an offset to be made.
32 e Share-based payments Under UK GAAP, the intrinsic value market value of the share at date of grant less exercise price of the option was charged to the profit and loss account over the employee performance period.
Save As You Earn SAYE schemes were historically exempt from share-based payment accounting under UK GAAP.
IFRS 2 requires a fair value based method of accounting for share-based payments which takes into account the value of the option, not just the market price of the share on date of grant.
The cost of share-based payments is recognised over the relevant vesting period which is broadly comparable with UK GAAP.
There is no exemption under IFRS for SAYE schemes.
The adjustments in the reconciliations represent the recognition of the income statement charge for share-based payments under IFRS.
As permitted by IFRS 2, the adjustment has been calculated based on all share options and SAYE schemes granted since 7 November 2002 but which have not vested by 1 January 2005.
The balance sheet impact reflects the creation of a corresponding reserve within equity shareholders funds to offset the income statement charge.

Foreign currency loans which were the subject of currency hedging arrangements were retranslated at each period end using the contracted rate.
IAS 39 requires all derivatives to be recognised on the balance sheet at their fair value.
Movements in fair value should be reflected in the income statement unless prescriptive hedge accounting criteria are met.
The group manages interest rate and foreign exchange risk through the use of derivative financial instruments.
Accordingly, these are reflected in the balance sheet at their fair value under IFRS.
The group has attained hedge accounting from 1 January 2004 for the majority of its derivatives and, therefore, for those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, movements in fair value are either deferred in a hedging reserve within shareholders equity and released to the income statement in line with the underlying hedged item cash flow hedge or taken to the income statement and offset by a corresponding movement in the fair value of the underlying hedged item fair value hedge.
The income statement charge reflects the movement in fair value of those hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting and any small amounts of hedge ineffectiveness arising on those that do qualify.
In addition to the above, IAS 21 Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchanges Rates requires all monetary assets and liabilities to be retranslated at the year end exchange rate regardless of hedging arrangements in place.
Accordingly, the groups foreign currency borrowings, which under UK GAAP are retranslated at the contracted rate of exchange, have been retranslated using the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The movement in the liability has been offset by movements in the fair value of the cross currency swaps which are in place to hedge the loans.
As a result, there is no significant impact on the income statement.
32 g Dividends Under UK GAAP, dividends declared after the balance sheet date were recorded in the financial statements as at the balance sheet date.
Under IFRS, dividends declared after the balance sheet date cannot be included as a liability at the balance sheet date.
The adjustments in the reconciliations reflect the reversal of the period end proposed dividends in the balance sheet.
32 h Consolidated cash flow statement The insurance division holds deposits with financial institutions to meet the cost of settling future claims.
These deposits have maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
UK GAAP requires the movement in cash to be reported in the cash flow statement.
Cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand less overdrafts.
Under UK GAAP, the insurance division deposits did not meet the definition of cash and were therefore classified as a management of liquid resources in the cash flow statement.
The cash flows reported under IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements relate to movements in cash and cash equivalents.
Under IAS 7, cash equivalents are defined as short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Generally an investment qualifies as a cash equivalent where it has a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Accordingly, under IAS 7, the insurance division deposits form part of cash and cash equivalents.
