Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short term volatility on the Groups earnings through transaction exposures.
The Group does not hedge its exposure to fluctuations in earnings based upon translation of foreign currency earnings on consolidation.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
The $250 million loan and $30 million revolver facilities attract interest based on US LIBOR.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the Groups profit before taxation by approximately 628,000 2004: 145,000.
Interest rate hedges have been included in this calculation.
Although the Group consolidates a number of entities whose functional currency is not sterling, 84% of revenue is US$ denominated.
It is estimated that a general reduction of 10 percentage points in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have decreased the Groups profit before taxation by approximately 2,375,000 2004: 1,327,000.
