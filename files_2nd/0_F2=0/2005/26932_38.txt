Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22.
Restatement of opening balances at 1 January 2004 The Company has adopted International Financial Reporting Standards in respect of the year ended 31 December 2005.
In accordance with IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of Financial Reporting Standards the following is a reconciliation of the figures at 31 December 2003, the date of the Groups transition to IFRS, which were previously reported under the applicable UK Accounting Standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice.
They were carried at mid prices previously.
The resultant difference of 873,000 for the Group is included in capital reserves.
The Companys investment in the subsidiary undertakings, previously carried at cost, is also now fair valued under IFRS.
In this case, fair value equates to the net asset value of each of the subsidiary undertakings.
The effect of this is to increase the valuation of investments by 1,442,000.
The resultant difference is also included within other capital reserves.
2 No provision has been made for the final dividend on ordinary shares for the year ended 31 December 2003 of 2,768,000.
Under IFRS dividends are not recognised until they are declared and approved by shareholders.
This is therefore added to retained earnings and eliminated from other payables.
