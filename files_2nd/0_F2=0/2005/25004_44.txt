Notes to the Financial Statements 27 Defined benefit pension schemes The Group has followed the transitional arrangements allowed by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits which only requires disclosure of the asset or liability that would have been recognised in the balance sheet if the standard had been fully implemented.
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the US and Ger many.
In the case of the schemes operating in Ger many, any future obligations that the Group may incur in respect of benefits accrued to members in respect of past service are insured with local insurance companies.
The scheme in Ger many is not significant in the context of the Group.
The US scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 July 1996 and no benefits have accrued to the members of the scheme in respect of their service after that date.
For the purposes of deter mining the Groups pension cost, the scheme is valued on an annual basis by qualified independent actuaries.
The most recent valuation was as at 1 January 2004 with an update as at 31 March 2005 and used the projected unit method.
The actuarial assessment was based on the following principal assumptions: 2005 2004 2003 % %% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries nil nil nil Rate of increase in pensions in payment nil nil nil Discount rate 5.5 6.06.0 Inflation assumption 2.8 2.8 3.0 The assets and liabilities of the scheme and the expected rate of return were: Long-term Long-term Long-term rate of return rate of return rate of return expected Value as at expected Value as at expected Value as at 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 2005 2005 2004 2004 2003 2003 % m % m% m Equities 8.5 1.4 8.5 0.9 8.5 1.0 Bonds 5.5 3.3 6.03.76.3 4.3 Cash and other assets 3.5 0.5 4.5 0.2 5.5 0.1 T otal market value of assets 5.2 4.8 5.2 Present value of scheme liabilities 7.9 7.8 7.7 Deficit in the scheme 2.7 3.0 2.5 Related deferred tax asset 1.0 1.00.8 Net pension liability 1.7 2.0 1.7 The ef fects of the FRS 17 pension liability on the net assets and reserves of the Group are set out below: Y ear ended Y ear ended 31 March 31 March 2005 2004 Net assets m m Net assets excluding net pension prepayment under SSAP 24 459.3 478.9 Pension liability under FRS 17 1.7 2.0 Net assets including net pension liability under FRS 17 457.6 476.9 Reserves m m Profit and loss reserve excluding net pension prepayment under SSAP 24 137.2 130.6 Pension reserve under FRS 17 1.7 2.0 Profit and loss reserve including net pension reserve under FRS 17 135.5 128.6 If FRS 17 had been fully implemented on the basis of the assumptions noted above, there would have been no char ge to operating profit 2004 nil.
