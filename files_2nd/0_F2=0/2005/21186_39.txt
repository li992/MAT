c Additional information i Summarised aggregate financial information on the Groups interests in its associates is as follows: 2005 2004 m m Revenues 277 445 Share of profit before tax 39 28 Assets 2,897 2,786 Liabilities 2,275 2,171 Share of net assets 622 615 The associates have no significant contingent liabilities to which the Group is exposed, nor has the Group any significant contingent liabilities in relation to its interest in the associates.
ii In France, the Group has invested in a number of specialised investment companies.
These invest mainly in equities, bonds, cash and cash equivalents, and properties, and distribute most of their income.
Where the Group owns less than 50% of such companies, its interests are included in the consolidated balance sheet within financial investments or cash and cash equivalents as appropriate.
d Impairment testing The Groups investments in RBS Life Investments Limited and RBSG Collective Investments Limited have been tested for impairment by comparing their carrying values which include goodwill which arose on their acquisition with their recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amounts for both the investments have been determined based on value in use calculations.
The calculations use cash ow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a five year period and a risk adjusted discount rate of 9.9%.
Cash ows beyond that five-year period have been extrapolated using a growth rate of 4.5%.
The recoverable amounts signicantly exceed the carrying values of both the investments and a reasonably possible change to the key underlying assumptions will not cause the carrying values of the investments to exceed their recoverable amounts.
