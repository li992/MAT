The increase in the amortisation charge results from the amortisation of intangible assets arising on the acquisition of the aircraft instrument business of Horizon Aerospace LLC Horizon and Audiopack Technologies Inc Audiopack.
These intangible assets intellectual property, customer relationships and profit in opening order book had a fair value at acquisition of 28,100,000.
Both Horizion and Audiopack are included within Tactical & Sonar Systems.

These are calculated as follows: 2005 2004 000 000 Profit from operations 47,837 43,294 Add: Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 3,297 - a Operating profit adjusted 51,134 43,294 Profit before tax 40,702 40,089 Add: Loss on fair value movements on derivatives 3,436 - Add: Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 3,297 - b Profit before tax adjusted 47,435 40,089 Cash generated by operations see note 24 64,499 55,216 Purchase of property, plant and equipment 7,311 5,246 Proceeds on disposal of property, plant and equipment 100 3 Expenditure on product development and other intangibles 2,909 1,919 Purchase of Long-Term Incentive Plan shares 596 1,124 c Operating cash flow adjusted 53,783 46,930 50 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 2 Additional performance measures continued a Operating profit at in the table opposite has been shown before the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, which relates to acquired intellectual property, customer relationships and profit in acquired order book.
Under UK GAAP this charge would have formed part of the amortisation of goodwill, which was also excluded from headline operating profit.
Since the remainder of goodwill is no longer amortised, this charge has been excluded for b consistency.
Profit before tax as shown at in the opposite table and adjusted earnings per share see note 10 are also presented before the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition.
IAS 39 requires the Group to fair value the derivative instruments used to manage Ultras foreign exchange exposures.
This creates volatility in the valuation of the outstanding instruments as exchange rates move over time.
This will have minimal impact on profit over the full term of the instruments, but can cause significant volatility on particular balance b sheet dates.
Ultra is therefore stating profit before tax in the opposite table and adjusted earnings per share see note 10 before changes in the valuation of these instruments so that the underlying operating performance of the Group can more clearly be seen.
The Group is cash generative and reinvests funds to support the continuing growth of the business.
It seeks to use an accurate and appropriate measure of the funds generated internally while sustaining this growth.
For this, Ultra uses c operating cash flow adjusted, rather than cash generated by operations, as its preferred indicator of cash generated and available to cover non-operating expenses such as tax and interest payments.
The Group believes that using cash generated by operations, with the exclusion of net expenditure in property, plant and equipment and outflows for capitalised product development and other intangibles, would result in an understatement of the true cash cost of sustaining a growing business.

Amortisation of intangible assets is included within administrative expenses.
Transfers relate to items previously included within property, plant and equipment.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, typically as follows: Intellectual property 10 years Customer relationships 10 years Development costs 2 to 10 years Software 3 to 5 years Patents and trademarks 10 to 20 years Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill was allocated as follows: 2005 2004 000 000 Aircraft & Vehicle Systems Datel 35,375 35,375 Information & Power Systems comprising several CGUs 19,670 18,866 Tactical & Sonar Systems UnderSea Sensor Systems Inc. 14,172 14,172 Tactical Communication Systems 19,305 19,305 DNE Technologies 16,012 14,380 Other 10,843 5,321 115,377 107,419 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
54 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 11 Intangible assets continued The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on an estimated growth rate of nil per cent.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 8.4%.
A detailed review of the carrying value of goodwill at 31 December 2005 has been performed and the Directors consider that no adjustment is required.
a Acquisitions during the year In aggregate, consideration of 36,832,000 was paid in respect of acquisitions, all of which was discharged by means of cash and cash equivalents.
Aggregate assets and liabilities acquired comprised intangible assets of 28,248,000, property, plant and equipment of 1,701,000, cash of 222,000, inventories of 1,330,000, receivables of 1,359,000, current liabilities of 1,397,000 and provisions of 461,000.
Horizon Aerospace LLC On 28 March 2005 the Group, through a subsidiary, purchased the trade and assets of Horizon Aerospace LLC, a business based in Victor, New York, USA, for a cash consideration before expenses of 2.4 million.
This represents the fair value of the consideration payable.
The aggregate net assets acquired and their provisional fair values, based on the Directors initial assessment of net realisable value, were as follows: Book value Revaluations Fair value 000 000 000 Intangible assets - 476 476 Property, plant and equipment 361 36 325 Current assets: Inventories 660 254 406 Receivables 418 - 418 Current liabilities 145 - 145 Provisions: Warranty 79 66 145 Other 31 161 192 Net assets acquired 1,184 41 1,143 Goodwill capitalised at acquisition 1,276 Purchase consideration, including acquisition costs 2,419 Horizon made a contribution to Group profit after tax of 246,000 in the period from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2005.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition is attributable to the anticipated future operating synergies deriving from the combination of businesses.
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 55 Notes to accounts Group continued 11 Intangible assets continued Audiopack Technologies Inc. On 15 July 2005 the Group, through a subsidiary, purchased all of the share capital of Audiopack Technologies Inc. a Company based in Cleveland, Ohio, USA, for a cash consideration before expenses of 33.7 million.
The aggregate net assets acquired and their provisional fair values, based on the Directors initial assessment of net realisable value, were as follows: Book value Revaluations Fair value 000 000 000 Intangible assets 105 27,667 27,772 Property, plant and equipment 1,461 85 1,376 Current assets: Cash at bank 222 - 222 Inventories 1,760 836 924 Receivables 941 - 941 Current liabilities 1,243 9 1,252 Provisions: Warranty 10 114 124 Net assets acquired 3,236 26,623 29,859 Goodwill capitalised at acquisition 4,065 Purchase consideration, including acquisition costs 33,924 Audiopack contributed a loss after tax of 1,779,000 in the period from date of acquisition to 31 December 2005, after acquisition financing costs of 850,000 and amortisation of intangibles of 2,405,000.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition is attributable to the anticipated profits resulting from the access to new markets for the Groups existing products.
If the above acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the year would have been 350.0 million and Group profit attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been 30.5 million.
b Revisions to provisional fair values Videcom Fair values on acquisition have been adjusted for Videcom which was purchased in July 2004.
The revisions in value relate primarily to debtor provisions no longer required.
These additional fair value adjustments have resulted in a reduction to goodwill at acquisition.

The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

The new facility, which provides up to 120 million of revolving credit over a five year period, is denominated in Sterling, US dollars and Canadian dollars and is used for balance sheet and operational needs.
A further 10 million overdraft is available for short-term working capital funding.
All bank loans are unsecured.
Interest is charged at 0.375% 2004: 0.75% over base rate.
At 31 December 2005, the Group had available 45,292,000 2004: 31,773,000 of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
These undrawn facilities all expire within five years 2004: within one year.
19 Derivative financial instruments Exposure to currency and interest rate risks arise in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Currency risk The Group utilises currency derivatives in the form of forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros.
As noted in the Companys press release on 22 June 2005, the Group has applied IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement prospectively from 1 January 2005.
Consequently the relevant comparative information for 2004 does not reflect the impact of these standards and is accounted for on a UK GAAP basis.
This note therefore includes the disclosures required by IAS 32 and IAS 39 for the year ended 31 December 2005 and the disclosures required by Financial Reporting Standard 13 for the year ended 31 December 2004.
At 31 December 2005, the fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be a liability of approximately 1,168,000, comprising 663,000 assets included in trade and other receivables and 1,831,000 liabilities included in trade and other payables.
At 1 January 2005 an asset of 2,268,000 was recognised.
The loss on derivative financial instruments included in the Groups consolidated income statement for the period was 3,436,000 2004: nil.
The derivative financial instruments maturity dates are typically between one to eighteen months from the balance sheet date.
Where specific risks are identified maturity dates can extend beyond eighteen months.
The nominal values of the derivative contracts as at the 31 December 2005 were as follows: Australian dollars Aus$0.4m Euros 12.0m New Zealand dollars NZ$25.9m US dollars US$116.6m Japanese yen Yen297.3m Net investment hedges The Group has net investments in US and Canadian companies.
The associated foreign currency translation risk is hedged by external borrowings in US and Canadian dollars.
The value of the borrowings do not exceed the net investments, meeting the conditions required to qualify as effective hedges.
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 59 Notes to accounts Group continued 19 Derivative financial instruments continued Interest rate risk During the year the Group used interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
The interest rate swaps, denominated in US dollars and Canadian dollars, have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.
The swaps will mature over the next three years and have fixed swap rates ranging from 4.175 per cent to 4.815 per cent.
The floating rates are US dollar LIBOR and Canadian dollar LIBOR.
The nominal amounts of the interest rate swaps are US$40m and CAD$30m.
The interest rate swaps are designated effective cash flow hedges and the change in fair value has been charged to equity.
At 31 December 2005, the net fair value of interest rate swaps was 144,000 2004: nil.

The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of an option pricing model using the following assumptions for both 2004 and 2005: Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP Weighted average share price 6.42 5.94 5.80 5.50 Weighted average exercise price 6.19 5.93 5.82 N A Expected volatility % 17.70 21.07 20.48 19.4 Expected option life years 2.19 6.00 5.00 3.00 Risk free interest rate % 4.13 4.43 4.34 4.20 Expected dividends % 1.95 2.17 2.23 2.11 Figures in the above table show an average across similar schemes.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Details in relation to the LTIP are included in the Directors Remuneration report on page 40.
The Group recognised total expenses of 1,212,000 and 797,000 related to equity-settled share based payment transactions in 2005 and 2004 respectively.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Groups share price.
