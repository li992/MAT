The loss on ordinary activities after taxation and dividends dealt with in the accounts of the holding company was 115.5m 2004: profit of 189.0m.

The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on 301.0m 2004 restated: 250.1m being the profit for the year after taxation and 257.9m ordinary shares of 10p each 2004: 268.9m being the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of earnings per share above increased by the dilutive effect of potential ordinary shares from employee share option schemes of 3.8m shares 2004: 2.6m shares.
9 Prior period adjustment The requirements of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts and the revised UITF 17 Employee Share Schemes became mandatory for the Company for the year ending 29 January 2005.
The new standards change the presentation of the Companys own shares held by its ESOP trust from being recognised as an asset on the balance sheet to being deducted in arriving at shareholders funds.
In addition, the charge recognised in the profit and loss account is now based on the difference between the market value of the shares at the date of the award and the option exercise price, rather than the difference between the cost of the shares and their estimated realisable value.
The changes in accounting policy required to comply with these requirements have been accounted for as a prior period adjustment.
This adjustment comprised the reclassification of the cost of the investment in own shares at 31 January 2004 of 72.8m to an ESOP reserve, and the reclassification of the related provision of 6.9m to the profit and loss account reserve.
The overall impact of these changes has been to increase reported profit for the year ended January 2004 by 4.9m with a similar impact on the current year and reduce net assets at that date by 65.9m.

SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs The Group continues to report its pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section was undertaken by an independent professionally qualified actuary as at 31 March 2004 using the projected unit method.
The principal financial assumptions which have the most significant effect on the computation of the pension costs are those related to the rate of return on the investments and the rates of increase in earnings and pensions.
These assumptions have been derived from market yields applying at the valuation date.
In particular, the investment return used relating to pre-retirement liabilities was 2.75% per annum in excess of the assumed rate of increase in earnings and the investment return used relating to post-retirement liabilities was 2.25% per annum in excess of the assumed rate of pension increases.
Demographic assumptions have also been taken into account, in particular the general trend in mortality experience.
At 31 March 2004, the market value of the assets of the defined benefit section was 206m representing 80% of the liability for benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
A charge of 5m has been recognised in the year 2004: 6m as a variation in regular pension cost in respect of this deficit.
The regular pension cost amounted to 11.8m 2004: 10.3m.
From April 2003 the Group increased employer contributions to the scheme from 12.5% to 13.4% and increased them further to 15.5% with effect from April 2004.
Total employer contributions of 19.4m 2004: 15.6m were made in the year including a 7.5m 2004: 5m contribution in respect of the deficit on the defined benefit section and contributions of 1.4m 2004: 1.1m in respect of the defined contribution section.
At the year end, outstanding contributions to the defined contribution section included in other creditors were 0.2m 2004: 0.2m.
Pension contributions for the Group will continue to be set at a level that takes account of the past service funding position of the scheme.
Full pension costs of the Group amounted to 18.6m 2004: 17.6m including the estimated cost of meeting unfunded unapproved pension liabilities relating to scheme members whose benefits would otherwise be restricted by the Inland Revenue salary cap.
There is a pension accrual in the balance sheet of 19.8m 2004: 20.9m.
Further payments will be made in the year ahead in respect of the defined benefit section deficit and the Board will keep the need for any further such payments under review.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits The pension costs shown in these accounts comply with the current pension cost accounting standard, SSAP 24.
The new pension cost accounting standard, FRS 17, is applicable for year ending January 2006 and subsequent years.
Under transitional arrangements the Company is required to disclose the following information about the scheme and the treatment that would have been shown under FRS 17 in the accounts for the year ended 29 January 2005.
The information required for disclosure in accordance with FRS 17 Retirement Benefits is based on the most recent full actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2004 and updated to 29 January 2005 in order to assess the liabilities of the defined benefit section including the unfunded, unapproved arrangement at that date.
