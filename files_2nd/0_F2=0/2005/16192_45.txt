Awards will vest under the PSP subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR based performance condition under which the Companys TSR performance will be measured over the fixed three year period against both the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts the Index and a comparator group of oil and gas companies.
Half of an award will be tested against the Index and the other half against the comparator group.
The test is over a three year period starting on the 1st January prior to grant, and an individual must normally remain in employment for three years from grant for the shares to vest.
