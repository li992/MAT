Notes on the accounts continued 3 Pension costs The Group operates a number of pension schemes which are predominantly defined benefit schemes whose assets are independent of the Groups finances.
In addition to The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Pension Fund Main Scheme, the Group operates a number of other UK and overseas pension schemes.
It also provides other post-retirement benefits, principally through subscriptions to private healthcare schemes in the UK and the US and unfunded post-retirement benefit plans.
Provision for the costs of these benefits is charged to the income statement over the average remaining future service lives of the eligible employees.
The amounts are not material.
