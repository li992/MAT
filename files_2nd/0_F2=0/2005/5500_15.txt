A number of these properties were leased several years ago on what are now unattractive terms.
The conclusion of the review was that whilst the Group is actively pursuing all options for these properties, an additional provision of 5.4m is required against these leases: this has been charged to the profit and loss account.
Restructuring During the financial period, the Group has undertaken a restructuring programme at a number of its European operations.
There were three elements to the programme: the cessation of manufacturing at the Groups Guyon factory in France: the consolidation of manufacturing for the Groups European Beverage business into the UK from Germany: and the reshaping of other UK businesses, including exiting from minor unprofitable product lines.
Associated costs include redundancy, fixed asset and inventory write-downs, vacant property costs and operating losses, arising from the decision to cease manufacturing.
2004 Following an adverse judgement in 2004 in the Consolidated Industries litigation, and as a result of the decision to appeal, the Group reassessed its accruals for legal costs for defending the claims and has provided a further 3.2m.
The Groups view of the outcome of the Consolidated Industries litigation remains unchanged see note 26 for more details.

The Group received cash consideration of $6.0m 3.1m and incurred cash costs 0.4m and other costs of 0.2m.
The exceptional loss on disposal was 7.4m primarily as a result of the non-cash write-back of goodwill 8.0m previously written off to reserves.
As a result of the disposal, Group net assets increased by 0.6m.
2004 In FY04 the majority of warranties and indemnities that the Group gave at the time of the disposals of two of its subsidiaries expired.
As a result, excess provisions totalling 2.2m were credited to the profit and loss account.

This allowed the reinstatement of dividends and has led to the termination of the Companys SEC reporting obligations.
The programme has simplified the Groups debt financing, reduced interest and compliance costs and freed up management time to focus on further business growth.
A total exceptional cost of 17.5m has been charged in respect of our capital restructuring programme including 2.1m of 3 professional fees charged within operating profit, 12.6m of early settlement interest on the 10 8% Senior Subordinated Notes Notes and 2.8m of non-cash write off of deferred finance costs.
The cash cost of the total transaction was 13.7m.
2004 Deferred finance fees written off of 2.7m relate to amounts previously capitalised in respect of the Senior Credit Facility that was replaced by the Groups refinancing executed on 17 September 2004.

Capital restructuring As part of the capital restructuring programme undertaken during 2005, the Group made certain changes to its debt facilities.
On 6 May 2005, the Group entered into an amended and restated Credit Agreement the Facility increasing the existing facility amount from $225 million to $400 million, with the additional $175 million maturing in October 2010.
The remaining terms of the existing facility are unchanged and all additional amounts were provided by the existing lenders.
Drawings under the Facility bear interest at between 0.75% and 1.50% above LIBOR as periodically determined by reference to certain agreed financial ratios.
Current drawings bear interest at LIBOR 0.85%.
Most of our significant subsidiaries are guarantors under the Facility and have unconditionally guaranteed all of the outstanding obligations under the Facility.
On 17 May 2005, the Group launched a tender offer to repurchase 100m of Notes.
The tender offered 1,144.22 per 1,000 principal of Notes for all Notes successfully tendered.
Offers for 77.0m were received by the Group and these were repurchased on 21 June 2005.
An amount of 3.1m of Notes were subsequently repurchased on the open market.
On 27 July 2005, the Group irrevocably transferred the remaining 19.9m of liabilities under the Notes into a trust administered by Bank of New York the Trustee together with UK government gilts and cash sufficient to meet all remaining future liabilities arising on the Notes including an early redemption fee payable in April 2007.
In certain circumstances, it is possible for the assets and liabilities of the trust to be returned to the Company.
These circumstances, which are considered to be highly remote, are: that within 123 days from the date of transfer the UK Government defaults on the gilts invested in the trust or that the Trustee absconds with the cash and or gilts invested: that within 180 days from the date of transfer the Company enters bankruptcy with the consequence that the funds in the Trust would be considered as the Companys assets for the purpose of distributions to the various creditors: that a Court, government or similar authority issues an order preventing the Trustee from applying the funds to settlement of the debt obligations: circumstances in which the transfer is not effective due to insufficient funds being initially deposited: and if any amounts remain unclaimed by April 2009.
Accordingly, the Notes and associated gilts and cash see note 16 are not derecognised from the balance sheets of the Company or the Group.
Swaps The Group has entered into cross currency swaps to create synthetic foreign currency denominated debt.
Two contracts have been entered into to exchange an aggregate of 60m for US dollars and Euros, such that the currency profile of the debt more closely matches the currency profile of the Groups assets.
The Group may from time to time use interest rate swap or forward rate agreements to change a portion of its debt between fixed and floating rates, to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on the Groups interest charge.
At 1 October 2005, the Group had interest rate swaps outstanding with an aggregate nominal value of $90m.
Other loans Other loans consist primarily of 9.5m of Industrial Revenue Bonds IRBs 2004: 9.3m off-set by a favourable revaluation of cross-currency swaps used to hedge debt of 4.0m 2004: 4.2m.
The IRBs are either at fixed rates of interest or are at rates of interest set periodically by reference to market rates.
The IRBs incurred rates of interest of between 2.8% and 6.1% during the period.
Letters of credit drawn under the Facility were 41.8m 2004: 41.4m.

The fair value of the Notes has been calculated as the sum of the discounted cash flows of expected future payments on the 1 Notes, using a discount rate of 4 2%.
The fair value of the current asset investments is the closing mid price on the close of business on the balance sheet date, after excluding accrued interest and cash balances.
The fair value of short-term deposits and borrowings approximates the carrying amount because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of the long-term borrowings approximates the carrying value due to the debt being subject to floating rates or short-term fixed rates.
e Hedging As explained in the review of operations and finance on page 30, the Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: Interest rate risk using interest rate swaps, caps and collars and forward rate agreements.
Balance sheet translation risk using cross currency swaps and borrowings in functional currencies.
Commodity risk using fixed price nickel and other commodity contracts.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is likely to be recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are as follows: Gains Losses 2005 2005 m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 3 October 2004 0.1 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised in the period 0.1 Gains and losses arising in 2005 that were not recognised in the period Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 October 2005 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2006 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2007 or later f Currency profile The main functional currencies of the Group are Sterling and US$.

SSAP24 a A small number of the Groups full time UK employees as at 1 October 2005 are members of defined benefit arrangements with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The defined benefit scheme in the UK is the Berisford 1948 Pension Scheme the Berisford Scheme.
A valuation was carried out by a qualified independent actuary at 31 March 2004 using the projected unit method.
Following the valuation it was agreed that the employer would pay contributions at the rate of 30% of pensionable salaries.
The main financial assumptions used in the valuation are set out below: Investment returns 5.5% p. a.
Present and future pensions 5.0% p. a.
The total market value of the Berisford Schemes assets at the last valuation date was 77.7m.
The funding level after allowing for future increases in earnings, and using a market value of assets, was 99%.
b Enodis Corporation maintains a 401 k plan which covers most of its employees.
This is a defined contribution arrangement.
c Scotsman Industries maintains a number of pension and 401 k plans which cover substantially all of its employees.
Benefits under defined benefit plans for hourly paid employees are based on a fixed multiple of the length of service and for salaried employees are based on a percentage of earnings during the period of their employment.
All pension plans have been funded in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
The last valuation of the main defined benefit plan was as at 1 January 2005.
No employer contributions are currently being paid to this arrangement.
The following main assumptions were used to develop net pension costs for pension plans in the US in the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2005: Discount rate 5.5% p. a.
Future salary increases N A Future pension increases Nil The total market value of the total US plan assets as at 1 October 2005 was 19.4m.
The funding level of the funded US plans as a percentage of accrued benefits, after allowing for future increases in earnings, and using a market value of assets, was 72%.
d Scotsman Industries also operates two post retirement medical plans.
Pension expense for the year has been calculated using the FRS17 assumptions as at 1 October 2005 disclosed below.
FRS17 In the UK, the figures for the Berisford Scheme have been based on a full actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2004 carried out by a qualified independent actuary.
For the pension and post retirement medical plans in the US, the figures have been based on full actuarial valuations as at 1 January 2005, updated to the current period end.

Enodis, et al.
In the case, the bankruptcy trustee sought to hold Enodis Corporation liable as the alter ego of its former subsidiary Consolidated Industries Corporation Consolidated, for the debts and other liabilities of Consolidated.
Enodis Corporation sold Consolidated to an unrelated party in 1998.
Shortly after the sale, Consolidated commenced bankruptcy proceedings.
In addition to the alter ego claim, the trustee asserted a variety of bankruptcy and equitable claims seeking to recover up to $37m paid by Consolidated to Enodis Group between 1988 and 1998.
As previously discussed in our 2004 Annual Report, on 7 January 2003, the United States District Court entered a partial summary judgement for $8.6m against Enodis Corporation in relation to the complaint by the trustee that the purchase price paid to Enodis for the share capital of Consolidated was a fraudulent transfer under US bankruptcy law.
On 28 July 2004, the Bankruptcy Court issued an opinion dismissing all claims against all defendants other than Enodis Corporation, and held that the trustee was not entitled to assert the alter ego claims against Enodis Corporation.
However, the Court also held that the trustee was entitled to recover $30m paid by Consolidated, plus prejudgement interest, for a total of approximately $43m.
This judgement is in addition to the summary judgement issued by the United States District Court in 2003.
Enodis Corporation has appealed the adverse portion of the decision of the Bankruptcy Court and will appeal the previous adverse decision of the District Court when it is appropriate to do so.
The Directors, having considered advice from external legal counsel, believe the adverse portion of the decision of the Bankruptcy Court and the decision of the District Court to be in error, and based on said advice further believe it is probable that Enodis appeals will be successful.
The Group is also involved in other Consolidated lawsuits involving $3.25m of specified claims as well as other claims for unspecified damages.
These claims are currently pending and we continue to defend them vigorously.
Other parties in cases pending against Consolidated have threatened to sue Enodis Corporation as Consolidateds alter ego.
Currently, however, no party other than the trustee is actively pursuing this theory against Enodis Corporation.
