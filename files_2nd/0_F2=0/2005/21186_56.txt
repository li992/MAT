Shareholder profits on unitised with-profit business written by Norwich Union Life & Pensions and on stakeholder unitised withprofit business are derived from management fees and policy charges, and emerge in the non-profit funds.
In France, where the majority of policyholders benets are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In addition, a substantial number of policies participate in investment returns, with the balance being attributable to shareholders.
In the Netherlands, the balance of profits, after providing appropriate returns for policyholders and after tax, accrues for the benefit of the shareholders.
The bases for determining returns for policyholders are complex, but are consistent with methods and criteria followed generally in the Netherlands.
In addition, a substantial number of policies provide benets which are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
ii Group practice The long-term business provision is calculated separately for each of the Groups life operations.
The provisions for overseas subsidiaries have generally been included on the basis of local regulatory requirements, mainly using the net premium method, modied where necessary to reect the requirements of the Companies Act.
Material judgement is required in calculating the provisions and is exercised particularly through the choice of assumptions where there is discretion over these.
In turn, the assumptions used depend on the circumstances prevailing in each of the life operations.
Provisions are most sensitive to assumptions regarding discount rates and mortality morbidity rates.
Bonuses paid during the year are reected in claims paid, whilst those allocated as part of the bonus declaration are included in the movements in the long-term business provision.
iii Methodology and assumptions There are two main methods of actuarial valuation of liabilities arising under long-term insurance contracts the net premium method and the gross premium method both of which involve the discounting of projected premiums and claims.
Under the net premium method, the premium taken into account in calculating the provision is determined actuarially, based on the valuation assumptions regarding discount rates, mortality and disability.
The difference between this premium and the actual premium payable provides a margin for expenses.
This method does not allow for voluntary early termination of the contract by the policyholder, and so no assumption is required for persistency.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses including those vesting following the most recent fund valuation, but no such provision is made for future regular or terminal bonuses.
However, this method makes implicit allowance for future regular or terminal bonuses already earned, by margins in the valuation discount rate used.
The gross premium method uses the amount of contractual premiums payable and includes explicit assumptions for interest and discount rates, mortality and morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions can vary by contract type and reect current and expected future experience.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses and explicit allowance is also made for future regular bonuses, but not terminal bonuses.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 150 Financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 35 Insurance liabilities continued The principal assumptions in the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands are: a United Kingdom With-profit business The valuation of with-profit business has changed signicantly during 2005 in accordance with the realistic basis set out by the UKs Financial Services Authority, adjusted to remove the shareholders share of future bonuses.
The key elements of the Realistic Balance Sheet methodology are the with-profit benefit reserve WPBR and the present value of the expected cost of any payments in excess of the WPBR referred to as the cost of future policy-related liabilities.
The realistic liability for any contract is equal to the sum of the WPBR and the cost of future policy-related liabilities.
The WPBR for an individual contract is generally calculated on a retrospective basis, and represents the accumulation of the premiums paid on the contract, allowing for investment return, taxation, expenses and any other charges levied on the contract.
For a small proportion of business, the retrospective approach is not available or inappropriate, so a prospective valuation approach is used instead, including allowance for anticipated future regular and final bonuses.
The items included in the cost of future policy related liabilities include: Maturity Guarantees: Smoothing which can be negative : Guaranteed Annuity Options: GMP underpin on Section 32 transfers: and Expected payments under Mortgage Endowment Promise.
In the Provident Mutual and With-profit funds in NUL&P, this is offset by the expected cost of charges to WPBR to be made in respect of guarantees.
The cost of future policy-related liabilities is determined using a market-consistent approach, mainly based on a stochastic model calibrated to market conditions at the end of the reporting period.
Non-market-related assumptions for example, persistency, mortality and expenses are based on experience, adjusted to take into account future trends.
Where policyholders have valuable guarantees, options or promises, then future persistency is assumed to improve, and future take-up rates of guaranteed annuity options are assumed to increase.
The principal assumptions underlying the cost of future policy related liabilities are as follows: Future investment return A risk-free rate equal to the spot yield on gilts, plus a margin of 0.1% is used.
The rates vary, according to the outstanding term of the policy, with a typical rate as at year end 2005 being 4.23% for a policy with ten years outstanding.
Volatility of investment return The volatility of returns is assumed to be distributed as follows: Financial investment Volatility Equities 20% for UK stocks Property 15% Gilts 3.25% NUL&P WP 4.75% other WP funds Corporate bonds 5.25% NUL&P WP 6.75% other WP funds Future regular bonuses Annual bonus assumptions for 2006 have been set consistently with the year end 2005 declaration.
Future annual bonus rates reect the principles and practices of the fund.
In particular, the level is set with regard to the projected margin for final bonus and the change from one year to the next is limited to a level consistent with past practice.
Mortality Mortality assumptions are set with regard to recent company experience and general industry trends.
Since 2004, there have been some changes to the adjustments to the base tables for annuities in payment in order to reect more closely the actual experience of this business.

The cash ows are calculated using the amount of contractual premiums payable, together with explicit assumptions for investment returns, ination, discount rates, mortality, morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions vary by contract type and reect current and expected future experience.
All contracts are assumed to continue for the contractual term.
For unit-linked and some unitised with-profit business, the provisions are valued by adding a prospective non-unit reserve to the bid value of units.
The prospective non-unit reserve is calculated by projecting the future non-unit cash ows on the assumption that future premiums cease, unless it is more onerous to assume that they continue.
Where appropriate, allowance for persistency is based on actual experience.
Valuation discount rate assumptions are set with regard to yields on the supporting assets and the general level of long-term interest rates as measured by gilt yields.
An explicit allowance for risk is included by restricting the yields for equities and properties with reference to a margin over long-term interest rates or by making an explicit deduction from the yields on corporate bonds, mortgages and deposits, based on historical default experience of each asset class.
A further margin for risk is then deducted for all asset classes.
The provisions held in respect of guaranteed annuity options are a prudent assessment of the additional liability incurred under the option on a basis and method consistent with that used to value basic policy liabilities, and includes a prudent assessment of the proportion of policyholders who will choose to exercise the option.
For all non-profit business, including annuities, valuation discount rate assumptions are set with regard to yields on the supporting assets and the general level of long-term interest rates as measured by gilt yields.
The changes in the valuation discount rates since 2004 reect the changes in the yields on the supporting assets.

The net premium method is used for prospective valuations, in accordance with local regulation, where the valuation assumptions depend on the date of issue of the contract.
The valuation discount rate also depends on the original duration of the contract and mortality rates are based on industry tables.

The reserves for general insurance and health are based on information currently available: however, it is inherent in the nature of the business written that the ultimate liabilities may vary as a result of subsequent developments.
Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses LAE in respect of all claims that have already occurred.
The provisions established cover reported claims and associated LAE, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported and associated LAE.
Outstanding claims provisions are based on undiscounted estimates of future claim payments, except for the following classes of business for which discounted provisions are held: Rate Mean term of liabilities Country Class 2005 2004 2005 2004 Netherlands Permanent health and injury 3.21% 3.27% 7 years 10 years No equalisation or catastrophe reserves have been recognised.
This treatment differs from UK GAAP and is explained in note 1 on the first time adoption of IFRS.
The net outstanding claims provisions before discounting were 13,014 million 2004: 12,816 million.
The period of time which will elapse before the liabilities are settled has been estimated by modelling the settlement patterns of the underlying claims.
Assumptions Outstanding claims provisions are estimated based on known facts at the date of estimation.
Case estimates are generally set by skilled claims technicians, applying their experience and knowledge to the circumstances of individual claims.
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is then estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as the Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.
The main assumption underlying these techniques is that a companys past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs.
As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios.
Historical claims development is mainly analysed by accident period, although underwriting or notication period is also used where this is considered appropriate.
Claim development is separately analysed for each geographic area, as well as by each line of business.
Certain lines of business are also further analysed by claim type or type of coverage.
In addition, large claims are usually separately addressed, either by being reserved at the face value of loss adjuster estimates or separately projected in order to reect their future development.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 154 Financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 35 Insurance liabilities continued In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made regarding future rates of claims ination or loss ratios.
Instead, the assumptions used are those implicit in the historic claims development data on which the projections are based.
Additional qualitative judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in the future, for example, to reect one-off occurrences, changes in external or market factors such as public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims ination, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling procedures in order to arrive at the estimated ultimate cost of claims that represents the likely outcome, from the range of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved.
Movements The following changes have occurred in the general insurance and health claims provisions during the year: 2005 2004 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 12,750 12,378 Impact of changes in assumptions 6 30 Claim losses and expenses incurred in the current year 7,124 6,770 Increase decrease in estimated claim losses and expenses incurred in prior years 372 234 Incurred claims losses and expenses 6,746 6,506 Less: Payments made on claims incurred in the current year 3,379 3,120 Payments made on claims incurred in prior years 3,407 3,244 Recoveries on claim payments 263 233 Claims payments made in the year, net of recoveries 6,523 6,131 Other movements in the claims provisions 9 27 Changes in claims reserve recognised as an expense 214 402 Gross portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 153 2 Foreign exchange rate movements 146 32 Other gross movements 8 64 Carrying amount at 31 December 12,965 12,750 The effect of changes in the main assumptions is given in Note 39. d Loss development tables The tables that follow present the development of claim payments and the estimated ultimate cost of claims for the accident years 2001 to 2005.
The upper half of the tables shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to each accident year.
For example, with respect to the accident year 2001, by the end of 2005 5,966 million had actually been paid in settlement of claims.
In addition, as reected in the lower section of the table, the original estimated ultimate cost of claims of 6,590 million was re-estimated to be 6,754 million at 31 December 2005.
This increase from the original estimate is due to the combination of a number of factors, including claims being settled for larger amounts than originally estimated.
The original estimates will also be increased or decreased, as more information becomes known about the individual claims and overall claim frequency and severity.
In the year of adoption of IFRS, only five years are required to be disclosed.
This will be increased in each succeeding additional year, until ten years of information is included.
The Group aims to maintain strong reserves in respect of its non-life and health business in order to protect against adverse future claim experience and development.
As claims develop and the ultimate cost of claims become more certain, the absence of adverse claims experience will then result in a release of reserves from earlier accident years, as shown in the loss development tables below.
However, in order to maintain strong reserves, the Group transfers much of this release to current accident year 2005 reserves where the development of claims is less mature and there is much greater uncertainty attaching to the ultimate cost of claims.
The release from prior accident year reserves during 2005 is also due to an improvement in the estimated ultimate cost of claims.
