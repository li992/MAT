For the calculation of combined ordinary capital, the exchange rate of 1 Fl.
12 5.445 has been used, in accordance with the Equalisation Agreement.
The calculations of diluted earnings per share are based on: i conversion into PLC ordinary shares of the shares in a group company which are convertible in the year 2038, as described in Corporate governance on page 44: ii conversion of the 0.05 NV preference shares, details of which are set out below and in note 24 on page 124: iii the effect of share-based compensation plans, details of which are set out in note 31 on pages 132 to 141: and iv the forward equity contract described in note 31 on page 141.
On 15 February 2005, we converted the 0.05 NV preference shares into ordinary 0.51 NV shares.
The conversion was made using shares already held by Unilever for the purposes of hedging the Groups share-based compensation plans.
Unilever bought further ordinary shares in the market during 2005 to the extent required to restore the hedging position.
Until the date of conversion, the 0.05 preference shares were potentially dilutive for the purposes of the calculation of fully diluted earnings per share, as shown below.
At midnight on 13 July 2005 the 0.05 NV preference shares were cancelled.
