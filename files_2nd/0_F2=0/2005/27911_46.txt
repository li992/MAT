FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups operations are financed principally by floating rate, asset backed loan notes and, to a lesser extent, by a mixture of share capital, retained earnings, corporate debt and bank borrowings.
The Group issues financial instruments to finance its lending operations and uses derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk arising from fixed rate lending or borrowing.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example debtors, prepayments and accruals, arise directly from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The principal risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The Board operates through the Asset and Liability Committee to review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged throughout the year and since the year end and the position disclosed below is materially similar to that existing throughout the year.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 61 29.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Credit risk The Groups business objectives rely on maintaining a high-quality customer base and place strong emphasis on good credit management, both at the time of acquiring or underwriting a new loan, where strict lending criteria are applied, and in the collections process.
First mortgages and secured loans are secured by charges over residential properties in England and Wales, or similar Scottish or Northern Irish securities.
Car loans are secured by the financed vehicle.
Despite this security, in assessing credit risk, an applicants ability and propensity to repay the loan remain the principal factors in the decision to lend.
In order to control credit risk relating to counterparties to the Groups financial instruments, the Asset and Liability Committee determines which counterparties the Group will deal with, establishes limits for each counterparty and monitors compliance with those limits.
Liquidity risk The Groups assets are principally financed by asset backed loan notes issued through the securitisation process.
Securitisation substantially reduces the Groups liquidity risk by matching the maturity profile of the Groups funding to the profile of the assets to be funded.
Asset backed loan notes The asset backed loan notes are secured on portfolios comprising variable and fixed rate mortgages or personal, retail and car loans, and are redeemable in part from time to time, but such redemptions are limited to the net capital received from borrowers in respect of the underlying assets.
There is no requirement for the Group to make good any shortfall out of general funds.
It is likely that a substantial proportion of these notes will be repaid within five years.
Interest is payable on notes denominated in sterling at various rates between 0.11% and 2.00% above the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR for three month sterling products: on notes denominated in euros at various rates between 0.11% and 1.40% above the Euro Interbank Offered Rate EURIBOR for three month euro products: and on notes denominated in US dollars at various rates between 0.18% and 1.40% above the London Interbank Offered Rate for three month US dollar products Dollar LIBOR.
During the year, Group companies issued 1,700.0m 2004: 2,114.8m of mortgage backed floating rate notes at par and 750.0m 2004: nil of asset backed floating rate notes at par.
Before its acquisition by the Group, Mortgage Trust had also obtained finance from the securitisation markets as described in note 16.
The sterling notes issued in these transactions, which form part of Non-Recourse Finance in the Group balance sheet are secured on the underlying assets and bear interest at various rates between 0.23% and 1.80% above LIBOR for three month sterling products.
The companies which issued these notes have entered into 215.0m 2004: 215.0m of sterling revolving credit facilities to fund, where necessary, the purchase of mortgage redraws.
At 30 September 2005 nil 2004: nil had been drawn down under these facilities.
62 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Bank borrowings In connection with the acquisition of Mortgage Trust the Group entered into a bank loan secured against cashflows generated by certain of the acquired assets.
Interest is payable on this loan at a rate of 1.35% above LIBOR.
This loan is repayable only out of cash receipts generated by these assets and there is no further recourse to the Group.
Included within bank loans at 30 September 2005 is 16.4m 2004: 28.8m in respect of this loan.
The Group is party to an arrangement, made via the quasi-subsidiaries described in note 19, whereby the Group received monies from a UK bank in return for the right to receive certain future cash flows from a securitised portfolio.
The commercial effect of this transaction is that of a bank loan, secured on the assets of the portfolio concerned, but subordinated to the asset backed loan notes.
Payments on this facility are made out of receipts from borrowers in the same way as for the asset backed loan notes.
Included in bank loans at 30 September 2005 is 1.0m 2004: 7.3m in respect of this arrangement.
Assets are typically securitised within twelve months of origination.
Until that point new loans are funded by a bank facility.
This is currently provided by a 1,425.0m 2004: 1,325.0m committed sterling facility provided to Paragon Second Funding Limited by a consortium of banks.
895.8m 2004: 468.5m is included in bank loans in respect of drawings on this facility.
This facility is secured on all the assets of Paragon Second Funding Limited, Paragon Car Finance Limited and Paragon Personal Finance Limited.
This facility remains available for further drawings until 29 February 2008 and although its final repayment date is 28 February 2050 it is likely that substantial repayments will be made within the next five years.
The 60.0m 2004: 225.0m committed sterling facility provided to Arianty No.
1 PLC by a consortium of banks is still in place.
6.0m is included in bank loans in respect of drawings on this facility 2004: 220.0m.
This facility is secured on all the assets of Arianty No.
At the year end the facility remained available for further drawings until 14 November 2005.
This was renewed for a further year for a reduced amount and may be further renewed on an annual basis.
Repayment of the loan is due two years after it ceases to be available for further drawings.
Assets originated by Mortgage Funding Corporation PLC are funded by a 55.0m 2004: 55.0m committed sterling bank facility.
31.6m 2004: 28.5m is included in non-recourse finance in respect of drawings on this facility.
This facility is secured on all the assets of that company.
This facility is repayable on 4 August 2006.
As with the asset backed loan notes, repayments of all of these facilities before the final repayment date are restricted to the amount of principal cash realised from the funded assets.
In addition to these borrowings the Group has a committed corporate syndicated sterling bank facility of 280.0m 2004: 280.0m, used to provide working capital for the Group.
Included in bank loans are drawings of 71.3m 2004: 177.0m made by Paragon Finance PLC under this facility.
This facility falls due for repayment on 27 February 2008.
The facility is secured on all the assets of the Company and Paragon Finance PLC.
Interest on the bank facilities is payable at various rates between 0.22% and 0.90% above LIBOR.
The undrawn amounts on these bank facilities at 30 September 2005 and 30 September 2004 are set out below.
2005 2004 m m Undrawn committed facilities for which repayment would fall due: In one year or less 23.3 - In more than one year but not more than two years 54.0 31.5 In more than two years 636.0 958.0 713.3 989.5 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 63 29.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Corporate bond On 20 April 2005 the Company issued 120.0m of 7% Callable Subordinated Notes at an issue price of 99.347% to provide long-term capital for the Group.
These bonds bear interest at a fixed rate of 7% per annum and are repayable on 20 April 2017, but may be repaid on 20 April 2012 at the Companys option.
They are unsecured and subordinated to any other creditors of the Company.
At 30 September 2005 118.2m 2004: nil was included within creditors in respect of these bonds.
Cash and investments Cash received in respect of loan assets is not immediately available for Group purposes, due to the terms of the warehouse facilities and the securitisations.
Included within Cash at bank and in hand and Investments at 30 September 2005 is 325.3m subject to such restrictions 2004: 378.5m.
Cash at Bank and in hand also includes 1.7m 2004: 0.5m held by the Trustees of the Paragon Employee Share Ownership Plans which may only be used to invest in the shares of the Company, pursuant to the aims of those plans.
Investments includes sterling term deposits with London banks which are disclosed as liquid resources in the cash flow statement.
The securitisation process and the terms of the warehouse facilities effectively remove any liquidity risk from the funding of the Groups loan assets.
It remains to ensure that sufficient funding is available to provide capital support for new loans and working capital for the Group.
This responsibility rests with the Asset and Liability Committee which sets the Groups liquidity policy and uses detailed cash flow projections to ensure that an adequate level of liquidity is available at all times.

The rates of interest payable on the loan facilities and on asset backed loan notes issued in the securitisation process are reset quarterly on the basis of LIBOR.
The interest rates charged on the Groups variable rate loan assets are determined by reference to, inter alia, the Groups funding costs and the rates being charged on similar products in the market.
Generally this ensures the matching of changes in interest rates on the Groups loan assets and borrowings and any exposure arising on the interest rate resets is relatively short term.
Forward rate agreements may be used to hedge against any perceived risk of temporary increases in LIBOR rates at month ends.
The fixed rate corporate bond is hedged by use of a long-term interest rate swap agreement until the optional repayment date in 2012.
This converts the interest payable to a LIBOR-linked floating rate basis.
In part, the Groups interest rate hedging objectives are achieved by the controlled mismatching of the dates on which instruments mature, redeem or have their interest rates reset.
The table overleaf summarises these repricing mismatches.
For the purposes of the table, loan assets, borrowings and derivatives are allocated to time bands by reference to the earlier of the next contractual interest rate repricing date and the maturity dates.
For those fixed rate loan assets where the customer has contracted to make regular repayments of both capital and interest, the assets have been allocated across the time bands in the table by reference to the contracted repayments.
The analysis takes no account of early terminations which are likely to occur in practice.
In determining the amount of hedging required, the Group makes assumptions about the level of regular capital repayments and early terminations of its loan assets.
The actual interest rate sensitivity will therefore be determined by reference to subsequent customer and management decisions and is expected to be less sensitive than shown.
Off balance sheet items shows the notional principal amount of swap agreements.
The table includes short term creditors and debtors.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued The Asset and Liability Committee monitors the interest rate risk exposure on the Groups loan assets and asset backed loan notes and ensures compliance with the requirements of the trustees in respect of the Groups securitisations.
All derivative contracts are accounted for as hedges.
Changes in the fair value of instruments used as hedges are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged position matures.

As a condition of the issue of these notes, interest rate and currency swaps were put in place for the duration of the borrowing having the effect of converting the liability to a LIBOR linked floating rate sterling borrowing.
As a result the Group has no material exposure to foreign currency risk.
