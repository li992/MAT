Notes on financial statements continued 6 Segmental analysis The groups primary format for segment reporting is business segments and the secondary format is geographical segments.
The risks and returns of the groups operations are primarily determined by the nature of the different activities that the group engages in, rather than the geographical location of these operations.
This is reflected by the groups organizational structure and the groups internal financial reporting systems.
BP has three reportable operating segments: Exploration and Production: Refining and Marketing: and Gas, Power and Renewables.
Exploration and Production's activities include oil and natural gas exploration and field development and production, together with pipeline transportation and natural gas processing.
The activities of Refining and Marketing include oil supply and trading as well as refining and petrochemicals manufacturing and marketing.
Gas, Power and Renewables activities include marketing and trading of natural gas, natural gas liquids, new market development, liquefied natural gas LNG and solar and renewables.
The group is managed on an integrated basis.
The accounting policies of operating segments are the same as those described under the heading Accounting policies.
Sales between segments are made at prices that approximate market prices, taking into account the volumes involved.
Segment revenue, segment expense and segment result include transactions between business segments.
These transactions and any unrealized profits and losses are eliminated on consolidation.
The groups geographical segments are based on the location of the groups assets.
The UK and US are significant countries of activity for the group: the other geographical segments are determined by geographical location.
Sales to external customers are based on the location of the seller, which in most circumstances is not materially different from the location of the customer.
Crude oil and LNG are commodities for which there is an international market and buyers and sellers can be widely separated geographically.
The UK segment includes the UK-based international activities of Refining and Marketing.

This adjustment has two offsetting elements: the net margin on crude refined by Innovene as substantially all crude for its refineries is supplied by BP and most of the refined products manufactured are taken by BP: and the margin on sales of feedstock from BPs US refineries to Innovenes manufacturing plants.
The profits attributable to individual segments are not affected by this adjustment.
Neither does this representation indicate the profits earned by continuing or Innovene operations, as if they were standalone entities, for past periods or likely to be earned in future periods.
