Information regarding the scheme was sent to old IHG shareholders in a circular dated 3 May 2005 the Circular.
Save where the context otherwise requires, terms and expressions used in this note shall have the same meaning as in the Circular.
Under the scheme: a the existing ordinary shares were cancelled and old IHG shareholders at the record date were allotted 11 new ordinary shares, credited as fully paid, and were paid 24.75 in cash for every 15 existing ordinary shares then held: and b following the cancellation of the existing ordinary shares, the issued share capital of old IHG was restored to its former amount by the application of the whole of the reserve arising in the books of old IHG from the cancellation to issue shares of an equivalent nominal amount to the Company.

Shareholders owned the same proportion of the Company, subject to the adjustment for fractional entitlements, immediately following the implementation of the scheme as they held in old IHG immediately before the implementation of the scheme.
