41 Provisions continued The group makes full provision for the future cost of decommissioning oil and natural gas production facilities and related pipelines on a discounted basis on the installation of those facilities.
At 31 December 2005, the provision for the costs of decommissioning these production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives was $6,450 million 2004 $5,572 million and 2003 $4,720 million.
The provision has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 2.0% 2004 2.0% and 2003 2.5%.
These costs are expected to be incurred over the next 30 years.
While the provision is based on the best estimate of future costs and the economic lives of the facilities and pipelines, there is uncertainty regarding both the amount and timing of incurring these costs.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount reasonably determinable.
Generally, this coincides with commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or closure of inactive sites.
The provision for environmental liabilities at 31 December 2005 was $2,311 million 2004 $2,457 million and 2003 $2,298 million.
The majority of these costs are expected to be incurred over the next 10 years.
The extent and cost of future remediation programmes are inherently difficult to estimate.
They depend on the scale of any possible contamination, the timing and extent of corrective actions, and also the groups share of liability.
The group also holds provisions for litigation, expected rental shortfalls on surplus properties, and sundry other liabilities.
Included within the new provisions made for 2005 is an amount of $700 million in respect of the Texas City incident of which $492 million has been disbursed to claimants.
To the extent that these liabilities are not expected to be settled within the next three years, the provisions are discounted using either a nominal discount rate of 4.5% 2004 4.5% and 2003 4.5% or a real discount rate of 2.0% 2004 2.0% and 2003 2.5%, as appropriate.
42 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits Most group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans money purchase schemes or defined benefit plans final salary and other types of schemes with committed pension payments.
For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as the employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Defined benefit plans may be externally funded or unfunded.
The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.
Contributions to funded defined benefit plans are based on advice from independent actuaries using actuarial methods, the objective of which is to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
During 2005, contributions of $340 million 2004 $249 million and 2003 $258 million and $279 million 2004 $30 million and 2003 $2,189 million were made to the UK plans and US plans respectively.
In addition, contributions of $140 million 2004 $116 million and 2003 $86 million were made to other funded defined benefit plans.
The aggregate level of contributions in 2006 is expected to be approximately $750 million.
Certain group companies, principally in the US, provide post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits to their retired employees and dependants.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum period of service.
The plans are funded to a limited extent.
The cost of providing pensions and other post-retirement benefits is assessed annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.
The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2005.
The material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the various plans are set out below.
The assumptions used to evaluate accrued pension and other post-retirement benefits at 31 December in any year are used to determine pension and other post-retirement expense for the following year, that is, the assumptions at 31 December 2005 are used to determine the pension liabilities at that date and the pension cost for 2006.
Mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the countries in which we provide pensions, and have been chosen with regard to the latest available tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the group.
BPs most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK and US, where these tables lead to a further life expectancy for a male female currently aged 60 of 23 26 years in the UK and 22 26 years in the US.

The groups obligation for other post-retirement benefits at 31 December 2004 and 2005 reflects the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act.
The provisions of the Act provide for a federal subsidy for plans that provide prescription drug benefits and meet certain qualifications, and alternatively would allow prescription drug plan sponsors to co-ordinate with the Medicare benefit.
BP reflected the impact of the legislation by reducing its actuarially determined obligation for post-retirement benefits at 31 December 2004 and reducing the net cost for post-retirement benefits in subsequent periods.
The reduction in liability was reflected in the 2004 results as an actuarial gain assumption change.
Pension plan assets are generally held in trusts.
The primary objective of the trusts is to accumulate pools of assets sufficient to meet the obligation of the various plans.
The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.
A significant proportion of the assets are held in equities, owing to a higher expected level of return over the long term with an acceptable level of risk.
In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.
The long-term asset allocation policy for the major plans is as follows: Asset category Policy range % Total equity 55-85 Fixed income cash 15-35 Property real estate 0-10 Some of the groups pension funds use derivatives to manage their asset mix and the level of risk.
The groups main pension funds do not directly invest in either securities or real property of the company or of any affiliate.
Return on asset assumptions reflect the groups expectations built up by asset class and by country.
The groups expectation is derived from a combination of historical returns over the long term and the forecasts of market professionals.
The expected long-term rates of return and market values of the various categories of asset held by the significant defined benefit plans at 31 December are set out below.
A one-percentage-point change in these assumptions for the groups plans would have had the following effects: $ million One-percentage point Increase Decrease Investment return Effect on pension expense in 2006 346 348 Discount rate Effect on pension expense in 2006 78 93 Effect on pension obligation at 31 December 2005 4,911 6,379 The assumed US healthcare cost trend rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported.
