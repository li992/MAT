For the retail and small business portfolios, which comprise large numbers of small homogenous assets with similar risk characteristics, statistical techniques are used to calculate impairment allowances on a portfolio basis.
These models do not contain judgemental inputs.
The impairment charge in relation to retail and small business portfolios is 1,254m or 80% of the total impairment charge in 2005.
For larger accounts, impairment allowances are calculated on an individual basis using discounted expected future cash flows.
Subjective judgements are made in this process.
Changes in these estimates could result in a change in allowances and have a direct impact on the impairment charge.
However, the impairment charge in relation to larger accounts is 320m or 20% of the total impairment charge in 2005.
