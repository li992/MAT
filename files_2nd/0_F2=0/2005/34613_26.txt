b As a result of the 2004 reorganization, 1.6 million unvested options held by employees vested immediately and their termination dates were accelerated.
This vesting occurred either in accordance with the terms of the option plan or to avoid having these employees and Carnival Corporation incur unduly burdensome taxes upon the exercise of such options at a later date.
As a result of this accelerated vesting, we included an additional $19 million of stock-based compensation expense in the 2004 pro forma net income.
c These amounts include the expensing of stock options made to retirementeligible employees over the expected vesting period of the option.
SFAS 123 R, when adopted, will require the expensing of future option grants over the period to retirement eligibility, if less than the vesting period, because vesting is not contingent upon any future performance.
