The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates for the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cashgenerating units.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and long-term growth in gross domestic product.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on estimated growth rates of between 3% and 6% and a further 15 years based on estimated long growth in gross domestic product of 2.5%.
The rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rates used to discount the cash flows for all cash-generating units are between 7% and 10%.
At 31 December 2004, specific goodwill balances were identified as being impaired at a charge of 15,000,000 based on future projected cash flows.
At 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2005, the carrying amounts of goodwill for cash-generating units were impairment tested and deemed not to be impaired.
These were calculated based on future projected cash flows discounted at a rate of between 7% and 10% 2004: 7% and 10%, which represented the Groups weighted average cost of capital plus a premium for risk.
The weighted average cost of capital for the Group at 31 December 2005 was estimated as 7.58% 2004: 7.85%.
