The Company expenses an estimate of how many shares are likely to vest based on the market price at the date of grant, taking account of expected performance against the net asset value per share growth target and the three year service period.
Under the SIP the Company gives eligible employees free shares of up to 3,000 a year.
They can also purchase partnership shares for up to 1,500 a year that are matched 2 for 1 by the Company.
The free and matching shares are purchased at fair value in the market and expensed at time of allocation.
At the 2003 AGM the shareholders approved the LTIP whereby the Company may award employees a combination of performance shares and options.
Both components have the same performance targets based on net asset value per share growth and a three year service period.
Performance shares are valued at the market value at the date of the award.
The options are valued using a Black-Scholes model adjusted for dividends according to the table below: Long-Term Incentive Plan: 2004 awards 28 May 29 November Share price at grant date 663p 796p Exercise price 663p 796p Option life in years maximum 10 75 Risk free rate 5.10% 4.50% Expected volatility 30% 30% Expected dividend yield 3.00% 2.00% Value per option 194p 223p For both LTIP components the Company estimates the number of shares or options likely to vest and expenses that value over the relevant period.
Volatility has been estimated by taking the historical volatility in the Companys share price over a four year period and adjusting where there are known factors that may affect future volatility.
Vesting estimates take account of the Companys high staff retention rate.
Under the Sharesave Plans eligible employees can save up to 250 a month over a three or five year period and use the savings to exercise an option granted at the outset at a 20% discount to the then prevailing share price.
The fair value of the various options is expensed over the service period, based on a Black-Scholes model, assuming, for the grants during the current year, a risk-free rate of 4.50%, expected volatility of 30% and an expected dividend yield of 2.00%.
The values per option for these schemes range from 259 pence to 294 pence.
There are no performance measures.
An estimated 5% of the three year options and 7% of the five year options are assumed to lapse as employees leave the Company prior to the minimum service period.
Awards under the RAA and CISP are valued at the fair value of the shares at the date of grant and expensed over one year for the RAA, three years for the CISP.
