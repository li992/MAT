IAS 39 Transition balance sheet The Group adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: presentation and disclosure and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement from 3 January 2005.
In the preparation of its financial statements in accordance with IFRS for the year ended 2 January 2005, the Group continued to apply the hedge accounting rules of UK GAAP, taking advantage of the exemption available within IFRS 1 First time adoption of IFRS.
The Group is required to recognise transitional adjustments in accounting for its financial instruments in accordance with the measurement requirements of IAS 39 at 3 January 2005.
Although the Group has taken the decision not to hedge account for a number of its hedging arrangements, it is deemed to have hedge accounted under UK GAAP until 2 January 2005 and discontinued hedge accounting prospectively thereafter.
IFRS1 requires the Group to recognise various transitional adjustments to account for those hedging relationships at 3 January 2005.
The accounting for those hedging relationships at transition depends on the nature of the hedged item and the hedged risk.
Detailed below is a reconciliation between the IFRS restated balance sheet as at 2 January 2005 applying prior GAAP hedge accounting and the balance sheet after the adoption of both IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Certain of the Groups interest rate swaps, including cross currency interest rate swaps, that were previously accounted for as fair value hedges of borrowings under UK GAAP were not previously measured at fair value.
In these cases, the difference between the derivatives fair value and its previously reported carrying value has been recognised directly in opening retained earnings.
Changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged debt due to the hedged risk that was previously not recognised have also been recognised in opening retained earnings.
Adjustments to underlying hedged debt will be recognised in future earnings on an amortised cost basis.
Other interest rate swaps, currency and commodity contracts that were previously accounted for as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions under UK GAAP were not previously measured at fair value.
In these circumstances, the difference between the derivatives fair value and its previously reported carrying value has been recognised directly in equity.
In the case of settled commodity contracts, previously deferred gains and losses have been re-allocated to equity.
These deferred gains or losses will be recognised in future earnings at the time at which the hedged forecasted transaction is recognised.
Those swaps and currency contracts that were considered to be non-qualifying hedging instruments at the date of transition have been recognised at fair value with the difference between its fair value and its previously reported carrying value being recognised directly in opening retained earnings.
Additionally the Group has recognised the fair value of embedded derivatives found within certain of its supply contracts in opening retained earnings.
All derivative instruments will continue to be recognised on balance sheet at fair value with future gains and losses being recognised immediately in earnings, except when the hedging requirements of IAS 39 are met.
