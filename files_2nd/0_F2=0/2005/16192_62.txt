Bank Loans and Overdrafts continued Wherever possible the Company conducts and manages its business in Sterling.
At 31 December 2005 the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Company that were not denominated in the functional currency were $177 million 102.9 million cash drawings under the US$850 million Borrowing Base Facility held as a hedge against US$ denominated net assets in subsidiaries in the Companys Group Accounts.
Interest Rate Risk The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2005 was as follows: Stg US$ Total 000 000 000 Cash at Bank on which no Interest is Received 26 26 Fixed Rate Debt 42,500 34,286 76,786 Floating Rate Debt 51,516 68,573 120,089 Net Debt 93,990 102,859 196,849 The profile at 31 December 2004 for comparison purposes was as follows: Stg US$ Total 000 000 000 Fixed Rate Debt Floating Rate Debt 98,619 98,619 Net Debt 98,619 98,619 Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined by US Dollar LIBOR and Sterling LIBOR.
Fixed rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance for period greater than three months or bank borrowings where the interest rate has been fixed through interest rate hedging.
In September 2005 the Group completed an $850 million refinancing exercise which consolidated existing borrowings into a single Borrowing Base Facility, which has created a more efficient Group financing structure and materially reduced the cash collaterisation of decommissioning Letters of Credit.
The Borrowing Base Facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at Sterling LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 110 basis points to 225 basis points depending on utilisation and concentration of non-OECD Assets and US Dollar LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 110 basis points to 225 basis points depending on utilisation and concentration of non-OECD Assets.
The outstanding debt is repayable in variable amounts determined semi-annually over the period to 31 August 2012, or such other time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
There is no requirement under the Borrowing Base Facility to hedge interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR and US Dollar LIBOR.
The Borrowing Base Facility states that consideration should be given to hedging at least 30% of the interest rate exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR for Sterling and US Dollars in respect of loans under the facility from time to time, net of relevant cash balances.
In the above table for 2005, 76.8 million of the gross debt has been shown as fixed rate debt as the particular bank borrowings were fixed in November 2005 for a six month duration.
In December 2005, the Company executed an interest rate hedging programme effective February 2006, whereby 50% of the projected interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR and US Dollar LIBOR was hedged through the application of a series of interest rate swaps, options and zero cost collars.
The effect of these derivatives limits the interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR at 5.7% and US Dollar LIBOR at 5.8%.
The interest rate swaps, options and zero cost collars extend for a three year period for US Dollar and for an eighteen month period for Sterling LIBOR at varying notional principal amounts.
The interest rate swaps, options and zero cost collars do not give rise to material differences between book and fair values.
The hedged amounts are included in Floating Rate Debt in the above 2005 table as the interest rate hedging programme has an effective date of 24 February 2006.
