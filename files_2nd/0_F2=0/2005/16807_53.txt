Pensions As at 31 March 2005, the Group operated a number of pension plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
The Groups pension plans are provided through both dened benefit and dened contribution arrangements.
Dened benefit schemes provide benets based on the employees length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria.
Dened contribution schemes offer employees individual funds that are converted into benets at the time of retirement.
Further details on the three principal dened benefit pension schemes, in the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan are shown below.
In addition to the principal schemes, the Group operates dened benefit schemes in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Sweden and the United States.
Dened contribution pension schemes are provided in Australia, Belgium, Egypt, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.
There is a post retirement medical plan in the United States for a small closed group of participants.
The Group accounts for its pension schemes in accordance with SSAP 24, Accounting for pension costs.
Scheme liabilities are assessed by independent actuaries using the projected unit funding method and applying the principal actuarial assumptions set out in Pension disclosures required under SSAP 24 below.
Assets are shown at market value.
From 2006, the Group will account for its pension schemes in accordance with IFRS principles which are largely equivalent to the current FRS 17 requirements under UK GAAP.
Additional disclosures required under the current transitional provisions of FRS 17 are also set out below.
The bases of calculation under FRS 17 are signicantly different to SSAP 24.
Whilst both require use of formal actuarial valuations, FRS 17 requires the use of a different set of underlying assumptions and also species more frequent valuation updates.
Accordingly, when IFRS is implemented in full, the Groups reported pension costs and balance sheet position will change accordingly.
United Kingdom The majority of the UK employees are members of the Vodafone Group Pension Scheme the main scheme.
This is a tax approved dened benefit scheme, the assets of which are held in an external trustee-administered fund.
In addition, there is an internally funded unapproved dened benefit plan in place for a small number of senior executives.
The pension cost for these dened benefit arrangements are included in the summary information shown below.
The main scheme is subject to quarterly funding updates by independent actuaries and to formal actuarial valuations at least every three years.
The most recent formal triennial valuation of this scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2004 and valued scheme assets at 434 million and scheme liabilities at 393 million.
This represents a funding ratio of 111% 2004: 116%.
As a result of the triennial actuarial valuation, the Groups UK subsidiaries agreed to make a special lump sum contribution of 100 million during the financial year and to maintain the ongoing contributions of 13% of pensionable earnings.
The updated funding level as at 31 March 2005 has been estimated as approximately 130% using assumptions consistent with the 2004 actuarial valuation.
This special contribution brings the funding position on an FRS 17 basis to 101% at 31 March 2005.
The SSAP 24 liabilities are valued using the same assumptions adopted for the triennial valuation.
These are outlined further below.
As a result of the acceleration of payments, a net prepayment of 299 million 2004: 193 million is included in debtors due after more than one year, representing the excess of the amounts funded over accumulated pension costs.
Germany There are a number of separate pension and associated arrangements in Germany, with the majority of these being nanced through a funded trust arrangement.
The German schemes are subject to annual valuations, with the last formal valuations having been completed at 31 March 2005.
Under SSAP 24 requirements, an amount of 7 million 2004: 14 million is included in provisions for liabilities and charges, representing the excess of the accumulated pension cost over the funded amounts on some schemes, with an equal amount in prepayments 2004: nil, representing the excess of the amounts funded over accumulated pension costs for the remaining schemes.
Under the requirements of FRS 17, the total pension liability at 31 March 2005 for benets funded through the trust arrangement was 191 million.
The market value of the trust arrangement assets was 181 million.
A contribution of 14 million was made into the trust during the financial year.
The total FRS 17 pension liability for additional unfunded arrangements was 22 million.
Japan There are a number of separate pension schemes operating in Japan.
These plans are generally not funded externally.
The latest formal actuarial valuation was prepared at 31 March 2005.
Under the requirements of SSAP 24, an amount of 21 million 2004: 26 million is included in provisions for liabilities and charges, representing the excess of the accumulated pension costs over the amounts funded externally reecting the internally funded nature of the principal arrangements.
On an FRS 17 basis, liabilities are valued at 30 million at 31 March 2005 while scheme assets are valued at 2 million.

Pensions continued Pension disclosures required under SSAP 24 During the year ended 31 March 2005, the total amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of all the Groups pensions plans was 95 million 2004: 79 million, 2003: 95 million, as analysed below: 2005 2004 2003 m m m Dened benefit schemes: United Kingdom 31 31 24 Germany 5 712 Japan 28 10 32 Other 8 65 Net pension charge: Dened benefit schemes 72 54 73 Net pension charge: Dened contribution schemes 23 25 22 Total amount charged to the profit and loss account 95 79 95 Below is a summary of the principal assumptions used in calculating the pension cost for the year to 31 March 2005: UK Germany Japan %%% Rate of ination 2.5 2.0 1 Rate of increase in salaries 4.5 3.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.5 2.0 N A Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.5 N A Rate used to discount liabilities pre-retirement 6.8 5.5 2.5 Rate used to discount liabilities post-retirement 5.8 5.5 2.5 Notes: 1 Rate of increase in salaries in Japan is calculated in line with company specic experience where benets are salary related.
The components of the total pension costs of the three principal dened benefit schemes were as follows: 2 UK Germany Japan 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 m m m m m m m m m Regular cost 27 23 22 3 55 5 812 Interest credit cost 13 9 4 1 49 12 1 Variation in regular cost 17 17 6 1 2 2 23 118 Total 31 31 24 5 712 28 10 32 Notes: 1 The variation in regular cost was calculated by amortising the shortfall at the date of the last formal valuation or review over the future working lives of members on a percentage of pensionable salary basis.
For the purposes of determining the UK SSAP 24 variation in regular cost, a review was undertaken as at 31 March 2003 to reect the impact of investment market movements.
The charge for Japan in the year ended 31 March 2005 also included 23 million 2004: nil, 2003: 17 million in respect of lump sum redundancy benets payable through a redundancy programme associated with the retirement plan.
2 The charge for Japan for the year ended 31 March 2004 includes the pension costs in relation to companies sold during the year for that part of the year prior to their disposal.

The deficits reported under FRS 17 reect the different assumptions for valuing assets and liabilities compared with SSAP 24.
The funding policy for the German and UK schemes is reviewed on a systematic basis in consultation with the independent scheme actuary in order to ensure that the funding contributions from sponsoring employers are appropriate to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term.
The deficit in respect of other schemes at 31 March 2005 primarily relates to internally funded schemes in Italy, Sweden and the United States.
