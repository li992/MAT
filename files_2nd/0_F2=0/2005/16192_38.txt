Notes to the Financial Statements continued Note 16.
Financial Liabilities continued Interest Rate Risk continued In September 2005 the Group completed an $850 million refinancing exercise which consolidated existing borrowings into a single Borrowing Base Facility, which has created a more efficient Group financing structure and materially reduced the cash collaterisation of decommissioning Letters of Credit.
The Borrowing Base Facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at Sterling LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 110 basis points to 225 basis points depending on utilisation and concentration of non-OECD Assets and US Dollar LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 110 basis points to 225 basis points depending on utilisation and concentration of non-OECD Assets.
The outstanding debt is repayable in variable amounts determined semi-annually over the period to 31 August 2012, or such other time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
There is no requirement under the Borrowing Base Facility to hedge interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR and US Dollar LIBOR.
The Borrowing Base Facility states that consideration should be given to hedging at least 30% of the interest rate exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR for Sterling and US Dollars in respect of loans under the facility from time to time, net of relevant cash balances.
In the table for 2005, 76.8 million of the gross debt has been shown as fixed rate debt as the particular bank borrowings were fixed in November 2005 for a six month duration.
In December 2005, the Group executed an interest rate hedging programme effective February 2006, whereby 50% of the projected interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR and US Dollar LIBOR was hedged through the application of a series of interest rate swaps, options and zero cost collars.
The effect of these derivatives limits the interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR at 5.7% and US Dollar LIBOR at 5.8%.
The interest rate swaps, options and zero cost collars extend for a three year period for US Dollar and for an eighteen month period for Sterling LIBOR at varying notional principal amounts.
The interest rate swaps, options and zero cost collars do not give rise to material differences between book and fair values.
The hedged amounts are included in Floating Rate Debt in the above 2005 table as the interest rate hedging programme has an effective date of 24 February 2006.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Group holds a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts, with various counterparties, covering both its underlying oil and gas businesses.
In addition the Group holds a small portfolio of interest rate derivatives.
The Groups policy is to mitigate its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuation for a portion of its production, using a range of derivative financial instruments such as fixed price swaps, participating swaps, zero cost collars and other option structures.
The Groups policy is also to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in US Dollar and Sterling interest rates through the use of similar derivative financial instruments.
Fair Values of Derivative Instruments Under IAS 39 all derivatives must be recognised at fair value on the Balance Sheet with changes in fair value between accounting periods recognised in the Income Statement unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied.
The fair value is the amount for which the assets or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction at the relevant date.
Fair values are determined using quoted market prices where available.
To the extent that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved.
The fair value of derivative instruments are recorded on the Balance Sheet under the caption Derivative Financial Instruments under Current Liabilities and Non Current Liabilities.
The Groups derivative instrument book and fair values were as follows: 31 Dec 1 Jan 2005 2005 000 000 Derivative Instruments Gas Derivatives 31,520 1,148 Oil Derivatives 116,344 40,658 Interest Rate Derivatives 17 11 147,847 39,521 Analysed as follows: Amounts Falling Due within One Year 70,639 12,645 Amounts Falling Due after One Year 77,208 26,876 147,847 39,521 60 Tullow Oil plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 A large portion of the derivative liabilities at 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2005 relate to contracts acquired as part of the acquisition of Energy Africa in May 2004: these contracts cover 4,000 bopd at a maximum Brent Dated price of $29.30 barrel extending to 31 December 2009.
These derivative liabilities are substantially offset by an increase in the economic value of the underlying hedged future oil production.
Cash Flow Hedges From 1 January 2005, the Groups commodity and interest rate derivatives were classified as cash flow hedges under IAS 39.
As a result, the effective portion of hedging gains or losses as a result of changes in the fair values of designated hedging instruments is deferred in a separate component of reserves subject to the establishment of a highly effective correlation defined in IAS 39 as hedge effectiveness within a range of 80 -125% between the commodity hedge and the underlying physical commoditys pricing and sale characteristics.
Such effective gains or losses are deferred to reserves and are recorded on the Balance Sheet under the caption Hedge Reserve see note 22.
Any change in the time value component of the hedge instrument is immediately recognised in the Income Statement under the caption Loss on Hedging Instruments.
The testing of hedge effectiveness is measured on an intrinsic basis.
Similar hedge effectiveness testing is carried out in relation to the Groups interest rate derivatives.
Hedge ineffectiveness arises when the hedge correlation results are within the range of 80-125% but not 100% precisely.
Hedge ineffectiveness is recognised directly in the income statement in the period, and such hedge ineffectiveness for the oil and gas commodity hedges is described below.
Hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in the income statement under the caption Loss on Hedging Instruments and the associated tax effect is recorded under the caption Income Tax Expense.
Oil Hedges The Group uses a number of derivative instruments to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with its underlying oil revenues.
These derivative instruments include fixed price swaps, participating swaps, zero cost collars and other option structures.
Such oil derivatives will tend to be priced using pricing benchmarks, such as Brent Dated, which correlate as far as possible to the underlying oil revenues.
The Group hedges its estimated oil revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its revenues from substantially all of its West African oil interests.
At 31 December 2005 the Groups oil hedge position was summarised as follows: Oil Hedges H1 2006 H2 2006 2007 2008 2009 Volume bopd 10,242 10,217 5,500 4,500 4,000 1 Average Price $ bbl 39.63 40.04 38.25 32.74 29.20 1 Average hedge prices are based on market prices as at 31 December 2005 and represent the current value of hedged volumes.
The Groups oil hedges have been assessed to be highly effective within the range prescribed under IAS39 using a regression analysis.
There is however a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups oil hedges arising from, among other factors, the discount on the Groups underlying West African crude relative to Brent and the timing of oil liftings relative to the hedges.
On this basis an unrealised loss of 100.1 million has been taken directly to equity, with an associated deferred tax credit of 5.6 million also being recorded on the Balance Sheet.
The element of hedge ineffectiveness and change in time value in relation to the oil hedges amounting to a loss of 2.6 million, with an associated tax charge of 0.7 million, have been recognised in the Income Statement in the current period.
A proportion of the oil cash flow hedges do not generate an offsetting tax charge or credit.
Gas Hedges The Group uses a number of derivative instruments to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with its underlying gas revenues.
These derivative instruments include fixed price swaps, participating swaps, zero costs collars and other option structures.
Such gas derivatives will tend to be priced using pricing benchmarks which correlate as far as possible to the underlying gas revenues.
The Group hedges its estimated gas revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its revenues from substantially all of its UK gas interests.
At 31 December 2005 the Groups gas hedge position was summarised as follows: Gas Hedges H1 2006 H2 2006 2007 2008 2009 Volume mmscfd 77 41 10 9 1 Average Price p therm 59.54 39.26 59.22 57.40 1 Average hedge prices are based on market prices as at 31 December 2005 and represent the current value of hedged volumes.
