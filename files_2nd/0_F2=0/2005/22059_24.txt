Prior year adjustments for UITF 37 and UITF 38 The balance sheet at 31 March 2004 has been restated following the adoption of UITF 37 Purchases and Sales of Own Shares and UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts.
The impact on the company at 31 March 2004 has been to reduce fixed asset investments by 3.9m, being the carrying value of shares held by the employee share trust, increase debtors by 0.3m, being assets in the employee share trust, increase the revenue reserve by 0.6m, being the provision charged against own shares and other assets held by the employee share trust, and deduct the net 4.2m from shareholders funds.
The impact on the group is the same as for the company except for the restatement of debtors.
In addition, 0.5m has been deducted from fixed asset investments, 0.1m written off the revaluation reserve and 0.4m deducted from shareholders funds, being the book cost of own shares held by a subsidiary undertaking.

32 Pensions The group operates a number of pension schemes in the UK, USA and Germany.
The principal schemes, based in the UK, are the Caledonia, Sterling, Amber and Edinburgh Crystal pension schemes.
These schemes are of the defined benefits type, with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Contributions to the schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of the schemes actuaries.
In addition, contributions are made to independently operated personal pension plans.
For the year ended 31 March 2005, the total pension cost for the group was 3.4m 2004 2.5m.
Pension cost relating to the principal UK defined benefit schemes is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries, using the attained age and projected unit methods.
The latest actuarial valuations of the Caledonia, Sterling, Amber and Edinburgh Crystal pension schemes which are now closed to new members were at 31 March 2003, 1 October 2002, 6 April 2003 and 31 March 2002 respectively.
The main actuarial assumptions made in the valuations were that long term investment returns would be 0.25% to 3.60% per annum higher than the annual increase in pensionable salaries and that pensions would increase at the lesser of 5% per annum or the increase in the Retail Price Index.
The market value of the assets on the dates of the most recent actuarial valuations for the Caledonia, Sterling, Amber and Edinburgh Crystal schemes totalled 10.5m, 6.9m, 3.1m and 4.6m respectively.
The levels of funding for the schemes shown by the valuations, being the actuarial value of assets expressed as a percentage of accrued benefits at the valuation date, allowing for expected future increases in salaries, were 62% for Caledonia, 67% for Sterling, 53% for Amber and 91% for Edinburgh Crystal.
To address these funding shortfalls, revised schedules of contributions have been entered into between the trustees and the participating employers of each of the schemes on the advice of the schemes actuaries.
The schedules of contributions, other than in relation to Edinburgh Crystal, include lump sum payments in addition to increased percentages of pensionable salaries.
The above actuarial valuations showed an aggregated deficit of 13.0m.
Caledonia Investments plc 70 Annual report 2005 Notes to the accounts continued 32 Pensions continued FRS17 disclosures Although the company continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, the following transitional disclosures are made in accordance with FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes.
The principal schemes, based in the UK and USA, are the Caledonia, Sterling, Amber and Edinburgh Crystal pension schemes.
Where appropriate, this note presents an aggregation of information for these schemes.
Full actuarial valuations of the Caledonia, Sterling, Amber and Edinburgh Crystal schemes were carried out at 31 March 2003, 1 October 2002, 6 April 2003 and 31 March 2002 respectively.
FRS 17 based analyses of the schemes at 31 March 2005 have been prepared by independent qualified actuaries.
All of the principal schemes are now closed to new members.
As a consequence, under the projected unit method, the current service costs will increase as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries in valuing the schemes liabilities were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 % %% Rate of increase in salaries 4.3 4.5 4.3 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.0 3.0 3.0 Discount rate 5.4 5.6 5.6 Inflation rate 3.0 3.0 3.0 The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, were as follows: Long term Long term Long term return return return expected Valuation expected Valuation expected Valuation at Mar 05 at Mar 05 at Mar 04 at Mar 04 at Mar 03 at Mar 03 %m % m %m Company Equities 8.3 10.4 8.5 10.1 9.0 7.3 Bonds 5.0 0.8 5.0 0.9 4.8 0.9 Other 4.8 3.5 4.8 1.3 4.6 1.6 Total market value of assets 14.7 12.3 9.8 Present value of schemes liabilities 16.6 15.6 14.8 Deficit in the scheme 1.9 3.3 5.0 Related deferred tax asset 0.6 1.0 1.5 Net pension liability 1.3 2.3 3.5 Group Equities 8.0 32.2 8.1 30.3 8.2 22.7 Bonds 4.9 3.3 5.0 3.3 4.8 2.7 Other 4.8 5.5 4.4 2.6 6.1 4.3 Total market value of assets 41.0 36.2 29.7 Present value of schemes liabilities 55.2 51.6 48.5 Deficit in the schemes 14.2 15.4 18.8 Related deferred tax asset 4.2 4.6 5.6 Net pension liability 10.0 10.8 13.2 Caledonia Investments plc 71 Annual report 2005 32 Pensions continued The analysis of movements within the groups schemes was as follows: 2005 2004 2003 m m m Analysis of amount charged to operating profit Current service cost 1.2 1.5 1.6 Settlements and curtailments 0.1 Total operating charge 1.3 1.5 1.6 Analysis of amount credited to other finance income Expected return on pension schemes assets 2.8 2.2 3.0 Interest on pension schemes liabilities 2.8 2.7 2.7 Net return 0.5 0.3 Analysis of amount recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses Actual return less expected return on pension schemes assets 1.1 4.4 11.8 Experience gains and losses arising on the schemes liabilities 3.0 3.5 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of schemes liabilities 0.9 3.4 5.0 Actuarial gain recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses 0.2 4.0 13.3 Movement in deficit during the year Deficit in schemes at the beginning of the year 15.4 18.8 5.3 Movement in the year Current service cost 1.2 1.5 1.6 Contributions 2.3 1.4 1.1 Settlements and curtailments 0.1 Other finance income 0.5 0.3 Actuarial surplus 0.2 4.0 13.3 Deficit in schemes at the end of the year 14.2 15.4 18.8 History of experience gains and losses Difference between the expected and actual return on schemes assets Amount 1.1 4.4 11.8 Percentage of schemes assets 3% 12% -40% Experience gains and losses on schemes liabilities Amount 3.0 3.5 Percentage of the present value of the schemes liabilities 6% 7% Total amount recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses Amount 0.2 4.0 13.3 Percentage of the present value of the schemes liabilities 8% -27% 33 Capital gains tax As stated in the Dun & Bradstreet Capital Gains Tax Service, the market value of the companys ordinary shares at 31 March 1982, adjusted for the capitalisation issue in August 1982 and the sub-division in July 1984, was 65.90909p.
