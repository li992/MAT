AstraZeneca Annual Report and 126 Form 20-F Information 2005 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 25 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES CONTINUED General With respect to each of the legal proceedings described above, other than those which have been disposed of, we are unable to make estimates of the loss or range of losses at this stage, other than where noted in the case of the European Commission fine.
We also do not believe that disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if that is known, would be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings.
This is due to a number of factors including: the stage of the proceedings in many cases trial dates have not been set and overall length and extent of legal discovery: the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision: clarity as to theories of liability: damages and governing law: uncertainties in timing of litigation: and the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any.
However, although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings or investigations referred to in this Note 25 to the Financial Statements, we do not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on our financial position or profitability.
Taxation Where tax exposures can be quantified, a provision is made based on best estimates and managements judgement.
Details of the movements in relation to material tax exposures are discussed below.
AstraZeneca had made certain double taxation relief claims in accordance with its understanding of existing law.
Management estimated that the tax exposure as at 31 December 2004 in respect of the issue was $197m and the potential for additional losses above and beyond the amount provided was up to $130m, although considered that these additional losses were unlikely to arise.
It was also reported as at 31 December 2004 that AstraZeneca expected a definitive ruling on the matter within the next 12 months.
During the course of 2005, the relevant law on the availability of credit for foreign taxes was clarified, confirming that tax credits were to be allowed in accordance with the original claims made by AstraZeneca and with retrospective effect.
The Company has consequently released this provision of $197m to the income statement.
AstraZeneca faces a number of transfer pricing audits in jurisdictions around the world.
The issues under audit are often complex and can require many years to resolve.
Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make estimates and judgements with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit, and actual results could vary from these estimates.
The total accrual included in the Financial Statements to cover the worldwide exposure to transfer pricing audits is $543m, an increase of $143m due to a number of new audits and revisions of estimates relating to existing audits.
For certain of the audits, AstraZeneca estimates the potential for additional losses above and beyond the amount provided to be up to $190m: however, management believes that it is unlikely that these additional losses will arise.
Of the remaining tax exposures, the Company does not expect material additional losses.
It is not possible to estimate the timing of tax cash flows in relation to each outcome.
Included in the provision is an amount of interest of $174m.
Interest is accrued as a tax expense.
