ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 33.
EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS These are the Groups first consolidated annual financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted for use in the European Union IFRS.
The accounting policies noted on pages 38 to 45 have been applied in preparing the consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005, the comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2004 and the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 the Groups date of transition.
First Time Adoption IFRS 1 establishes the transitional requirements for the first time preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
In general, a company is required to determine its IFRS accounting policies effective at the reporting date and apply these retrospectively to the balance sheet at the date of transition, and all financial statements for the comparative period and the reporting period.
To assist in the transition process, there are a number of exemptions to this retrospective application.
The following signi cant exemptions have been adopted by the Group: i Business combinations: the Group has elected not to account for business combinations retrospectively in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Those combinations recognised prior to the date of transition have not been restated.
ii Employee bene ts: the Group has elected to adopt the amendments to IAS 19 Employee Bene ts which provide the Group with the option of recognising all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in equity at the date of transition, with subsequent actuarial gains and losses being taken directly to equity via the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
This is consistent with the treatment under UK GAAP, required by FRS 17 Retirement bene ts.
iii Share-based payment: in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, the Group is recognising a charge to income representing the fair value of outstanding employee share options over the relevant option vesting periods, adjusted to re ect the actual and expected levels of vesting.
However, the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 2 retrospectively to equity instruments either granted on or before 7 November 2002 and or vesting prior to 1 January 2005. iv Financial instruments: the Group has elected to apply the requirements of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement prospectively from 1 January 2005 and consequently the restated gures for 2004 do not re ect the impact of these standards.
v Valuation of properties: the Group has elected to treat the revalued amount of properties at 1 January 2004 as deemed cost as at that date and will not continue its policy of revaluing properties triennially.
Overview of impact For Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc the adoption of IFRS gives rise to the following signi cant changes: Measurement i The recognition, on balance sheet, of pension liabilities together with associated pension fund assets and other employee bene t liabilities: ii The inclusion in the income statement of a fair value charge in respect of outstanding employee share options: iii The recognition of certain financial instruments at fair value.
Speci cally under UK GAAP the Group did not recognise derivatives on the balance sheet: iv The recognition of deferred tax in respect of all taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base and the accounting base of balance sheet items: v Amounts of proposed dividends are not provided for.
Dividends are recorded as liabilities when declared: vi The recognition of payments made on entering into or acquiring operating leasehold land and buildings is required to be amortised over the lease term and classi ed as a prepayment versus the UK GAAP treatment of inclusion within tangible xed assets and the cost less residual value depreciated: vii The recognition of investment property valuation surpluses and fide cits through the income statement in other operating income instead of through reserves: viii Revenue in respect of non-hotel land development sales is now recognised on transfer of legal title and the risks and rewards of ownership, rather than on unconditional completion of sale: 89 MILLENNIUM & COPTHORNE HOTELS plc NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 33.
EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS Continued ix The Group no longer revalues hotel land and buildings from 1 January 2004 but records properties at depreciated cost or, where properties have been previously revalued, their depreciated deemed cost, being their carrying value at 1 January 2004, including previously recognised revaluation surpluses at that date.
Presentation i For joint ventures and associates, the share of equity accounted earnings after tax and minority interest is presented as a single line item in the operating result rather than being separately included within operating pro t, interest, taxation and minority interest: and ii The reclassi cation of the initial payment element of operating leased land is required to be accounted for as a prepayment instead of being recorded as a tangible xed asset.

IAS 17 requires a lease of land and buildings to be considered separately between its land and building constituent parts.
Land is only able to be treated as a tangible xed asset, held under finance lease, where it is considered likely that the Group will obtain title to the land during or at the end of the lease term.
The Group holds a number of hotels under long leases where land title is not anticipated to pass to the Group under the terms of the lease.
In respect of these leases, under UK GAAP, payment made on entering into or acquiring leasehold land and buildings was previously all included within tangible xed assets and the cost less residual value was depreciated over the shorter of its lease length and useful economic life.
Under IFRS, the initial payment made in respect of the operating leased land is required to be accounted for as a prepayment and amortised in full over the lease term in accordance with the pattern of bene ts provided.
This change in accounting policy has been adopted retrospectively to the date of lease acquisition by the Group.
Retained reserves at 1 January 2004 have been debited by 7.5m Group and 0.7m joint venture accumulated amortisation which would have been charged to that date, in excess of depreciation previously charged under UK GAAP.
This has not impacted total equity as an equal credit has been recorded to the revaluation reserve at 31 December 2003 to re ect how the Groups total interest in the hotel property is carried at valuation and in aggregate is maintained at the level of the most recent external valuation recorded.
This change in accounting policy has increased the annual amortisation charge in respect of leasehold land by 1.2m.
Long leasehold buildings lease premium continues to be accounted for as property, plant and equipment where the Group holds the asset for substantially all of its useful economic life.
ii Investment property The Group has adopted IAS 40 Investment Property.
IAS 40 is consistent with the Groups previous accounting policy of revaluing investment properties annually.
The principal change under IFRS is that valuation surpluses and fide cits arising are required to be recorded in the income statement in other operating income under IAS 40.
Under UK GAAP, such surpluses and fide cits were recorded directly within reserves.

EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS Continued Notes to tables a to e Continued ii Investment property Continued However, this change of accounting policy did not impact the 2004 income statement as no investment property valuation movements were recorded in that year.
iii Assets held for sale The Group applied IFRS 5 retrospectively from 1 January 2004 in respect of assets held for sale.
No adjustments were necessary in order to state assets at the lower of cost and fair value less disposal costs.
iv Real estate and land development sales On adoption of IAS 18, the Group changed the timing of revenue recognition in respect of its non-hotel land development sales.
Revenue in respect of these sales is now recognised on transfer of legal title and of the risks and rewards of ownership previously on completion of sale.
Operating pro t for the year ended 31 December 2004 has increased by 1.3m.
Total equity at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 has been reduced by 1.1m and 0.3m respectively.
v Property, plant and equipment and investments in joint ventures and associates On adoption of IAS 16, the Group changed the policy of triennial valuations on its portfolio of operating assets.
Under the transition rules of IFRS 1, the Group has elected to use previous UK GAAP carrying values at 1 January 2004, including revaluations, as deemed cost at transition.
Adoption of this policy has resulted in reversing the effect of surpluses previously capitalised during 2004.
Property, plant and equipment has reduced by 11.5m and reversal of the Groups share of revaluation of property, plant and equipment within investments in joint ventures and associates has reduced that investment by 17.5m.
vi Employee bene ts IAS 19: Employee bene ts requires full recognition of fide ned bene t pension obligations in the financial statements.
Under UK GAAP, the Group recognised in the pro t and loss account the estimated cost of providing the pensionable bene ts accrued in the period.
Variations from these costs were charged or credited to the pro t and loss account over the average remaining service lives of employees.
Adoption of IAS 19 has reduced equity at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 by 5.7m and 9.4m respectively excluding recognition of deferred tax.
Movements in the fide ned bene t obligation are primarily recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Actuarial gains and losses of 3.3m were charged to the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense in the year ended 31 December 2004.
The pension charge to the income statement was increased in the year ended 31 December 2004 by 0.4m.
vii Share-based payments The Group applied IFRS 2 to its active employee share-based payment arrangements at 1 January 2005 except for equitysettled employee share-based payment arrangements granted before 7 November 2002.
The Group has granted employee equity-settled share-based payments in 2004 and 2005.
The Group accounted for these share-based payment arrangements at intrinsic value under UK GAAP.
Under IFRS, the effect of accounting for equity-settled share-based payment transactions at fair value is to increase administrative expenses by 0.4m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The adoption of IFRS 2 is equity-neutral for equity-settled transactions.
The expense recognised for the consumption of employee services received as consideration for share options granted will be deductible for tax purposes when the share options are exercised.

EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS Continued Notes to tables a to e Continued viii Deferred taxes 1 January 31 December 2004 2004 m m Group deferred tax liability - UK GAAP 52.2 51.9 Property assets 170.9 162.2 Employee bene ts 2.4 3.3 Other 2.7 0.1 Tax losses carry forward 26.5 2.6 Increase in deferred tax liability 144.7 156.2 Group deferred tax liability IFRS 196.9 208.1 Property assets comprise property, plant and equipment, investment properties, assets held for sale and lease premium prepayment The deferred tax liability has been increased at each period end as shown in the table.
The increase in liability in respect of property assets is a result of the requirement under IFRS to provide for deferred tax for fair value adjustments and revaluation surpluses.
Deferred tax is matched to how the asset value will be recovered, either through use in the business or through sale.
Under UK GAAP, such provision was not required.
This adjustment is signi cant, principally due to the Group having previously adopted until 1 January 2004 a policy of carrying its hotel property assets at open market value.
The provision for employee bene ts and fide ned bene t pension liabilities, as set out above, gives rise to a matching recognition of a deferred tax asset.
The overall increase in deferred tax liabilities resulting from property assets has allowed the Group to increase its matching recognition of tax losses, which were not recorded in the balance sheet under UK GAAP.
Such losses are recognised as deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro ts will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
The effect on the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004 was to increase the previously reported tax charge for the period by 11.6m for subsidiary undertakings and by 3.7m for joint ventures.
The increase in the tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2004 principally relates to the disposal of the Groups joint venture interest in The Plaza Hotel, New York.
This is principally due to the utilisation of tax losses which were carried as assets on the IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004, and therefore formed part of the deferred tax charge.
These losses were largely unrecognised under UK GAAP and therefore their use did not incur a deferred tax charge.
The reported current tax charge in respect of the transaction remains unchanged.
ix Dividends Under IFRS dividends are recorded as liabilities in the period in which they are approved.
Under UK GAAP dividends were previously recorded when proposed.
