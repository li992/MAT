Beneficiation of the high-grade sulphide and green copper June 2004 report 8 mineralisation is through in-pit crushing, sharing a common processing plant Cerro Colorado is an open pit mine that lies within the oxidised and enriched complex.
Changes in the Resources of both deposits are due to the depletion portion of a porphyry copper deposit, with ore processed by leaching and of resources through copper production.
Stockpiled material from the Escondida SX-EW.
Changes from 2004 include depletion of production adjusted for mine are included as Measured Resources for the appropriate materials.
reconciliation differences, the results of in-fill drilling incorporated into an updated model that resulted in a small increase to the total resource and improved confidence.
The Resources stated herein have been reduced by an additional 4 million dry metric tonnes to correct a 2004 reporting error.
A new geological interpretation has resulted in minor and local changes.
There has been a steady and resource estimate unaudited was completed in October 2004 promotion of material into the Measured category.
Changes in metal prices and incorporating a complete re-evaluation of data included in the resource estimate exchange rates have resulted in an adjustment in the tonnages and grades presented in the 2003 and 2004 declarations.
The result of this estimate above a given A$60 dollar per tonne cut-off.
An independent audit was demonstrates no material change to the previous declaration.
An extensive infill completed on the resource this year.
drilling program was completed 60 000m at the end of July 2005.
This program targeted the first five years Spence production volume.
Drill results demonstrate no significant change in resource with respect to either the 2004 resource declaration or the October 2004 estimate.
10 The Olympic Dam operation was acquired in the purchase of WMC that was finalised in August 2005.
Resources are quoted per the March 2005 reporting by WMC, depleted by production.
Reviews of the resource estimation and reporting practices by Olympic Dam are currently in progress.
11 The April 2001 Antamina resource model that was reported in 2004 has been updated to include 144 167 meters of additional drill core information collected in 2003 and 2004.
The 2005 resource model includes changes to the data interpolation methods used for estimating grades and ore types.
These changes require more samples on a closer spacing to classify material as measured as compared to the 2001 resource model.
The amount of Measured Resources has therefore decreased significantly.
Sulphide mineralisation has been subdivided into Cu-only and Cu-Zn ore types to better reflect actual operations.

3 8 3 8 6 Differences with previous statements reflect the depletion of ore reserves through production.
Pit shells used to derive ore reserve are the same as those used in the previous statement with updated topography as at the end of June 2005.
Variable cut-off grade strategy during the production period has resulted in the reclassification of some Sulphide Leach ore into Sulphide mill feed.
Small tonnages of Indicated and Inferred Sulphide Leach resources were extracted and therefore they are now included on the stockpile figures as Proven ore reserves.
Stockpiled materials are included in the appropriate ore reserve estimate as Proved Reserve.
7 Differences with previous statements reflect the results of the pre-mine activities.
Small tonnages of ore encountered during pre-stripping activities are now stockpiled and included in the appropriate ore reserve estimate as Proved reserve.
8 Sulphide reserves increased by 12 million tonnes, excluding production, since June 2004, on the basis of the updated resource model and revised mine plan.
9 Changes in the Cerro Colorado Reserves reflect changes in the Resource base based on drilling and updated interpretation, and include depletion through mining, adjusted by reconciliation.
Although a new mine plan was determined from the updated model, pushback designs did not change compared to that reported in 2004.
10 Reserve changes for Spence from June 04 reflect project approval in October 2004 and are therefore net positive for June 2005, being that approved in the Spence feasibility study.
A mine planning exercise unaudited has been undertaken upon the October 2004 resource estimate and preliminary reserve calculations from this exercise show no material difference to the feasibility study calculation declared here.
Differences in reserves to those declared in Spence Feasibility Study are related to rounding to significant figures.
11 The Olympic Dam operation was acquired in the purchase of WMC that was finalised in August 2005.
Reserves are quoted per the December 2004 reporting by WMC, depleted by production.
A review of the Olympic Dam operations and expansion project is currently in progress, which includes a determination of the compliance with BHP Billiton Ore Reserve and Capital Investment policies.
12 At Antamina, a new optimised pit limit was determined from the May 2005 resource model that includes a different method of valuing mineralisation that now considers all costs for producing the metals, including mill throughput and penalty elements.
Higher commodity prices were used relative to the 2004, reflecting changed economic environment.
Changes include modifications to the ore valuation method.
13 Different extraction factors were used for each Mining Block.
These were based on production experience from those separate Mining Blocks.
The changes in reserves were due to promotion of material to Measured Resource category.

All resource figures are total Mineral Resources inclusive of material converted to Ore Reserves.
The bedded ore types are classified as per the host Archaean or Proterozoic banded iron formations.
These are BKM Brockman, MM Marra Mamba and NIM Nimingarra.
The CID Channel Iron Deposits are Cainozoic fluvial sediments.
2 The resource grades listed refer to in situ mass percentage on a dry weight basis.
%Pc represents phosphorous in concentrate for Samarco.
For Mt Newman, Jimblebar, Mt Goldsworthy and Yandi joint ventures tonnages represent wet tonnes based on the following moisture contents: BKM 3%, MM 4%, CID 8%, NIM 3.5%.
3 Changes at all joint ventures are in part due to a change in reporting precision where tonnes are now reported to the nearest 1 wmt, except Inferred Resources reported to nearest 10 wmt.
Change to reporting silica SiO, alumina Al O and Loss On Ignition LOI in addition to iron Fe and phosphorous P. Changes in Mt Newman JV 2 2 3 Resources are due to additional drilling and modelling of OB18 and OB25 Pit 3, review of estimates for OB31, removal of detrital material from Resource.
Changes to Goldsworthy JV Northern Areas Resources are due to significant new drilling and geological modelling as well as review of economic criteria for deep-rooted mineralisation.
Changes to Yandi JV Resources are due to a change in reporting cut-off for the E7 deposit.
Change at Goldsworthy JV Area C is due to additional drilling and an updated model for C Deposit.
Other changes are due to mining depletion.
Changes to BHP Coal due to remodelling of Carramulla East.

5 Whilst 85 per cent is shown as the BHP Billiton Interest for Area C, POSCO a Korean steelmaker has a 20 per cent legal interest in the C deposit of Area C. In substance, the Group retains virtually all of this interest and this disclosure and the financial statements are prepared on this basis.
6 West Australian Resources include lower grade material that is currently stockpiled when mined, but has not been considered for conversion to Reserve in the current 20-year business plan.
7 The Whaleback deposit in the Mt Newman joint venture has been re-modelled during the year but the updated Resource estimates have not been included in this report because the Resource has not yet been converted to Reserve.
The material change to the estimate is a significant 200wmt reclassification of Measured Resource to Indicated status.

5 Coal quality is for a potential product rather than the in situ quality and is on air-dried basis.
CV is calorific value, VM is volatile matter, and S is sulphur.
6 Illawarra Coal has completely revised its assessment criteria for Resource classification based on changes to the JORC Code and Australian Coal Guidelines as well as an internal review of environmental impacts and government approval requirements.
With the implementation of these revised criteria the previously declared resources for Authorisation 248 A248 and Exploration License 4470 EL4470 are no longer deemed to qualify as a resource.
At present Illawarra Coal is unable to clarify its position with respect to mining title and renewal of the Authorisations or granting of Assessment lease or mining title.
Because of this it cannot be guaranteed that all of the current authorisation areas have reasonable prospect of eventual extraction.

10 Changes at Mt Newman, Jimblebar, Mt Goldsworthy and Yandi joint ventures are in part due to a change in reporting precision where tonnes are now reported to the nearest 1 wmt, change to reporting silica SiO, alumina Al O and Loss On Ignition LOI in addition to iron Fe and phosphorous P. Changes to the Reserves for 2 2 3 Mt Newman JV and Jimblebar are due to changes to Fe cut-off grades used for reporting, changes to Resource classifications and changes to reconciliation factors.
Changes to Goldsworthy JV Northern Areas due to introduction of the Cattle Gorge deposit.
Changes to Yandi reserves due to change in pit designs.
Changes to Goldsworthy JV Area C Reserves due to new Resource model and revised pit design for C Deposit.
Other changes due to mining depletion.
11 Whilst 85 per cent is shown as the BHP Billiton Interest for Area C, POSCO a Korean steelmaker has a 20 per cent legal interest in the C deposit of Area C. In substance, the Group retains virtually all of this interest and this disclosure and the financial statements are prepared on this basis.

4 A different treatment of internal waste and yields has resulted in apparent changes to GEMCO resources and reserves.
In particular, the estimated reserve yield was increased by means of factors to reflect actual historic concentrator yields.
The net effect was an increase in ROM tonnes, product tonnes and reserve yield by 1621per cent.

6 A complete revision of the Illawarra Coal Reserve and in particular the criteria used for classification was undertaken in early 2005.
The focus of this revision was on the certainty of our ability to gain mining authority from the state government, impact of surface features and infrastructure, changes to the JORC and Coal Guidelines and the integrity and zone of influence of geological data used to support each Reserve classification.
The results of revised classification criteria were to reduce the reserve base by 102Mt from that reported last year.
Ongoing exploration and application for mining authority is anticipated to result in moving more of the Resource into Reserve classification next year.
7 Recoverable Coal Reserves tonnes is the sum of Proved and Probable Coal Reserve estimates, which includes allowances for diluting materials and for losses that occur when the coal is mined and are at the moisture content when mined.
Marketable Coal Reserve tonnes is the tonnage of coal available, at specified moisture and air-dried quality, for sale after beneficiation of the Recoverable Coal Reserves.
Note that where the coal is not beneficiated the recoverable tonnes are the marketable tonnes, with moisture adjustment where applicable.
8 Blackwater, South Blackwater, South Walker Creek & Gregory Crinum also produce a thermal coal product.
9 Peak Downs marketable reserves reduced by 14 per cent from FY04 estimates due to impact of Coal Guidelines and lack of surface rights, offset by additional pits and mine layout changes.
10 Saraji marketable reserves reduced by 38 per cent from FY04 estimates due to impact of Coal Guidelines, offset by changed mine layouts.
11 Gregory Crinum marketable reserves reduced by 42 per cent from FY04 estimates due to lack of surface rights.
13 South Walker Creek marketable reserves reduced by 40 per cent from FY04 estimates due to impact of Coal Guidelines and changes in economics.
