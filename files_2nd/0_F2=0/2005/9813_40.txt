Annual report 2005 Notes 20 Provisions for liabilities and charges continued Property leases When valuations of leasehold properties based on future estimated income streams give rise to a deficit as a result of onerous lease conditions they are recognised as liabilities in provisions.
Payments are expected to be ongoing on these properties for periods of 18 to 43 years.
The amounts are not discounted as the Directors consider the discounted amounts would not be materially different from the amounts recognised.
21 Pensions The Group contributes to three funded final salary defined benefit pension schemes and three Group personal pension plans defined contribution schemes.
Final salary pension schemes The Group operates a W&DB final salary pension scheme for employees who joined the scheme prior to 29 September 1997.
The Group contribution rate was 32.0% of pensionable salary throughout the year, following the recommendations of an independent qualified actuary.
The latest W&DB scheme valuation conducted by an independent actuary for the Group was as at 1 September 2005.
The actuarial valuation was carried out using the projected unit method.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the funding position of the scheme are those relating to the differences between the long-term rate of investment return and the rate of increase in earnings.
The valuation as at 1 September 2005 assumed that the long-term investment return pre-retirement would exceed salary increases by 3.3% per annum and price inflation by 4.3% per annum.
It assumed that the long-term investment return after retirement would exceed salary increases by 1.5% per annum and price inflation by 2.5% per annum.
The market value of the scheme assets was 195.7m, which was sufficient to cover 104% of members accrued benefits.
The valuation as at 1 September 2005 includes a special contribution of 29.0m from the Group to the scheme on that date.
Following the acquisition of Burtonwood on 6 January 2005, the Group contributed to the Burtonwood final salary pension scheme at a rate of 22.2% of pensionable salary for Category A non-contributory members and 17.4% of pensionable salary for Category B contributory members.
The Burtonwood pension scheme was valued by an independent qualified actuary at the date of acquisition.
The pension scheme was valued at a deficit of 1.0m which was included in the acquisition balance sheet as a creditor see note 27.
This valuation assumed that the long-term investment return pre-retirement would exceed salary increases by 3.5% per annum and price inflation by 4.5% per annum.
It assumed that the long-term investment return after retirement would exceed salary increases by 1.7% per annum and price inflation by 2.7% per annum.
The Group also contributed to the Jennings final salary pension scheme, following the acquisition of Jennings on 20 May 2005.
The contribution rate was 55.3% of pensionable salary.
The pension scheme was valued by an independent qualified actuary at the date of acquisition.
The pension scheme was valued at a deficit of 2.3m which was included in the acquisition balance sheet as a creditor see note 28.
The valuation as at 20 May 2005 assumed that the long-term investment return pre-retirement would exceed salary increases by 3.4% per annum and price inflation by 4.4% per annum.
It assumed that the long-term investment return after retirement would exceed salary increases by 1.1% per annum and price inflation by 2.1% per annum.
All final salary pension schemes are administered by trustees and are separate from the Group.
All final salary pension schemes are closed to new entrants.
It is therefore expected that the costs of benefits will steadily rise in future, as the average age of members increases.
The Group paid total contributions of 5.9m 2004: 5.8m to the final salary pension schemes during the period, comprising 5.5m paid to the W&DB scheme, 0.2m paid to the Burtonwood scheme and 0.2m paid to the Jennings scheme.
At 1 October 2005 a pension prepayment of 28.7m is included within debtors in respect of the W&DB scheme of which 0.7m is classified as due within one year and the remainder due after more than one year.
A provision of 3.3m is included within creditors in respect of the Burtonwood and Jennings schemes.
At 2 October 2004 a provision of 1.5m in respect of the W&DB scheme was included within creditors.
Group personal pension plans New employees who join the Group are offered membership of the W&DB Group personal pension plan.
The Group also operates two separate Group personal pension plans, for employees of Burtonwood and Jennings.
The Group paid contributions of 0.5m 2004: 0.4m to the Group Personal Pension Plans during the period.
