Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 31 Share-based compensation plans As at 31 December 2005, the Group had a number of share-based compensation plans: i All-Employee Option Plans Local All-Employee Option Plans have been set up in 16 countries to enhance employee involvement with Unilever and its performance by providing a potential financial benefit linked to the Unilever share price.
There are no individual performance targets to be met.
The plans permit participation by all permanent employees in the country where the relevant plan applies.
ii Executive Option Plans The Executive Option Plans were introduced in 1985 to reward key employees throughout the world for their contribution to the enhancement of the Groups longer-term future and their commitment to the Group over a sustained period.
The grant is dependent on performance of the Group and the individual.
iii Global Performance Share Plan Introduced in 2005, under this plan managers can be awarded conditional shares which will vest three years later at a level between 0% and 150% - 200% depending on Unilevers achievement of set targets for Underlying Sales Growth and Free Cash Flow over the three year performance period.
iv Share Matching Plans If managers invest part of their annual bonus in Unilever shares, the company will match this with the same number of shares on the condition that they keep all shares for an agreed number of years and will still be employed by Unilever on the vesting date.
v TSR Long-Term Incentive Plan This plan was introduced in 2001 and, depending on the TSR ranking see page 25 of Unilever in comparison with its peer group, it will potentially award top executives on the vesting date three years later with between 0% and 200% of the original conditional award.
vi North America Performance Share Programme A long-term incentive plan for North American managers, awarding Unilever shares if company and personal performance targets are met over a three-year period.
vii Restricted Share Plan Restricted shares can be awarded to a select number of executives for special performance.
After the agreed number of years the awards will vest provided the executive is still employed by Unilever at that time.
viii Other plans A cash-settled share-based retention plan was introduced in 2004 for a number of key executives.
Unilever will not grant share options in total in respect of Executive Option Plans for more than 5% of its issued ordinary capital, and for all Plans together, for more than 10% of its issued ordinary capital.
The Board does not apportion these limits to each plan separately.
In recent years we have met the obligations under our share option and award plans by purchasing shares in advance and transferring them, in return for the exercise price, to Directors and employees as the options are exercised or the awards vest.
The numbers in this note include those for Executive Directors shown in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 53 to 69 and those for key management personnel shown in note 33 on pages 142 and 143.
No awards were made to Executive Directors in 2005 and 2004 under the North America Performance Share Programme, the Restricted Share Plan or the cash-settled share-based retention plan.
NonExecutive Directors do not participate in any of the share-based compensation plans.
The economic fair value of the awards is calculated using an option pricing model usually an adjusted Black-Scholes or multinomial model and the resulting cost is recognised as remuneration cost amortised over the vesting period of the grant.
The actual remuneration cost charged in each period is shown below: million million 2005 2004 All-Employee Option Plans 13 17 Executive Option Plans 63 105 Global Performance Share Plan 15 Share Matching Plans 14 21 TSR Long-Term Incentive Plan 10 9 North America Performance Share Programme 63 64 Restricted Share Plan 2 Other Plans 12 2 192 218 Disclosures, including a description of the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair values of options and the weighted average information, are given below for each type of plan, on a combined basis.
132 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 31 Share-based compensation plans continued i All-Employee Option Plans Unilever has All-Employee Plans in 16 countries, which can be grouped together as follows: a Plans which follow a standard framework: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
b Other plans: North America, South Africa and United Kingdom.
Group a : The standard framework for these countries means, in principle, an annual grant of options over NV shares Ireland: PLC shares, at the same grant date, exercise price the market price on the grant date and grant size including part-time employees pro rata and with the same eligibility criteria all permanent employees in a country.
There are no vesting conditions other than being continuously employed by a Group company until the vesting date.
Group b : The UK and South Africa plans annually offer options over PLC shares, combined with a compulsory UK or optional South Africa savings plan.
The exercise price is the market price at date of grant.
In 2003, Unilever UK introduced ShareBuy, an All-Employee Share Incentive Plan.
It is currently only being used as a tax efficient savings plan for employees, for which Unilever neither gives nor receives value.
Accordingly, no gures for this plan are included in this note.
The North America programme is a share purchase offering, with a compulsory savings plan, under which up to 10% of the salary of eligible employees is withheld.
At the end of the period employees can use the savings to buy NV New York shares at a discount.
The maximum number of shares made available under the plan is 8.9 million.
The table below summarises the main country-specic differences between the plans under which grants were made in 2005: Maximum Vesting term period Exercise Country year of introduction Years Years period Remarks Austria 2001 5 3 24 months Belgium 2001 5 3.5 18 months Denmark 2001 5 3 24 months Finland 2001 5 3 24 months On 3rd, 4th or 5th anniversary France 2000 5 4 12 months Germany 2000 5 3 24 months Ireland 2002 5 3 24 months Italy 2001 5 3 24 months Netherlands 1995 5 0 5 years Keep shares during the first 3 years after grant Portugal 2001 3.5 3 6 months Spain 2001 5 3 24 months Switzerland 2001 5 3 24 months UK 1985 5.5 5 6 months ShareSave plan South Africa 2001 3.5 3 6 months Optional sharesave plan No grants were made in Sweden or North America in 2005 or 2004.

The exercise price is the market price at the date of grant.
Since the introduction of the Global Performance Share Plan in 2005, it is the intention to make no further grants under the Executive Option Plans, except for a few premium option grants which result from prior commitments.
The plans are made up of the following: NV Executive Option Plan The NV Executive Option Plan provides for the granting of options to purchase shares of Unilever N. V. and, from 1997 onwards, also shares of Unilever PLC, at a price not lower than the market price on the day the options were granted.
These options become exercisable after a threeyear period from the date of grant.
The options have a maximum term of five years for the grants made up to 1998 and of ten years for subsequent grants.
PLC Executive Option Plan The PLC Executive Option Plan provides for the granting of options to purchase shares of Unilever PLC and, from 1997 onwards, also shares of Unilever N. V. at a price not lower than the market price on the day the options were granted.
These options become exercisable after a threeyear period from the date of grant and have a maximum term of ten years.
North America Executive Stock Option Programme This programme is covered by the North American 2002 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan and provides for the granting of options to purchase a maximum of 40.5 million shares in Unilever N. V. of the New York Registry, and 262.0 million shares of Unilever PLC, at a price not lower than the market value on the day the options are granted.
These options become exercisable over a three-year period from the date of grant and have a maximum term of ten years.
Managers working in India can participate in an Executive Option Plan relating to Hindustan Lever Limiteds shares.
As these are neither NV nor PLC shares, no gures for this plan are disclosed in this note, but the fair value costs 2005: 2 million: 2004: 3 million are included in the costs of Executive Option Plans on page 132.

The trustees of these trusts have agreed, until further notice, to waive dividends on these shares, save for the nominal sum of 0.01p per 1.4p ordinary share.
Shares acquired during 2005 represent 1.6% of the Groups called up capital.
The book value of 2 258 million 2004: 2 625 million of all shares held in respect of share-based compensation plans for both NV and PLC is eliminated on consolidation by deduction from other reserves see note 25 on page 125.
Their market value at 31 December 2005 was 2 261 million 2004: 2 273 million.
At 31 December 2005 the exercise price of 7 850 127 2004: 20 224 246 NV options and of 44 867 061 2004: 88 066 266 PLC options was above the market price of the shares.
Shares held to satisfy options are accounted for in accordance with IAS 32 and SIC12.
All differences between the purchase price of the shares held to satisfy options granted and the proceeds received for the shares, whether on exercise or lapse, are charged to reserves.
In 2005 this includes 7 million 2004: 3 million for shares held to meet options expiring in the short term which are priced above market value.
The basis of the charge to operating profit for the economic value of options granted is discussed on page 132.
