The Quadrangle is a 26,000 sq ft business centre in a converted multi-storey Victorian former warehouse building in Fulham.
The property is in a location in which the Group has long sought representation.
It provides 26 units of accommodation ranging in sizes from 800 sq ft to 2,600 sq ft let mainly to locally based small businesses.
In time we seek to achieve 90%.
Southbank House is a 63,000 sq ft business centre located just off the Albert Embankment in London SE1 close to Lambeth Bridge.
It is the former head office and manufacturing premises for Royal Doulton china.
It provides 212 units of accommodation ranging in sizes from 50 sq ft to 2,300 sq ft with an average size of 332 sq ft.
The property complements the Groups other holdings in the area sitting between Westminster Business Square and Enterprise House Great Guildford Street extending the range of accommodation offer and servicing offered to our customers.
Part of the premises was occupied by the former owner giving us the opportunity, following its partial refurbishment, of increasing rental income.
In contrast, Southgate Office Village is a modern, purpose-built small unit office estate constructed in the mid 1980s.
It is located close to Southgate underground station and so is well located to service both the local business community and those businesses seeking accommodation near to the North Circular Road.
The property was originally let to larger nationally based companies, some of whom have now moved away.
We can refocus the property and the leasing package structure to provide a more attractive offer to smaller businesses thereby improving returns.
Chiswick Studios is a converted single-storey former industrial building located adjacent to the Chiswick Roundabout in West London, providing immediate access both to the A4 M4 and to the North Circular Road.
It provides 14,225 sq ft in six units, ranging in sizes from 530 sq ft to 4,400 sq ft.
The Groups Barley Mow Centre is nearby and we are tracking other properties in the area.
Lombard House and Lombard Business Park comprise 77,400 sq ft of office and industrial accommodation located on the A23, Purley Way at its junction with the A236.
The 45,000 sq ft office building is located prominently on the roundabout at this location and is well known locally.
The industrial estate is situated to the rear of the office building and comprises eleven single-storey north lit industrial buildings which are let to a mixture of local businesses.
The office accommodation is let to Vodafone under a lease extending to March 2010 which obliges Vodafone to convert all the space back to cellular business centre space on expiry of the lease.
Lewis House comprises three properties, Lewis House, 3a School Road and 99 Victoria Road in Park Royal.
It is very near to the Groups longstanding property, Acton Business Centre, located in School Road and the more recently purchased Westwood Business Centre and Europa House, both located in Victoria Road.
It further consolidates the Groups cluster of holdings in Park Royal.
Lewis House was vacant on acquisition with the industrial premises being let.
Following refurbishment Lewis House can be sub-divided to provide nine units of accommodation ranging from 200 sq ft to 750 sq ft.
