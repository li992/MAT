qxd 15 3 06 07:58 Page 65 65 7 Earnings per ordinary share and underlying profit reconciliation The Group seeks to present a measure of underlying performance, which excludes items considered to be non-operating in nature.
Underlying profit excludes the unrealised amounts arising from revaluations required by IAS 32 and IAS 39, and includes the realised amounts arising from settled derivative hedging transactions.
The calculation of underlying profit and underlying earnings per share is shown below.
For the year to December 31, 2004, IAS 32 and IAS 39 were not applied and consequently no adjustment is required.
Basic earnings per ordinary share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of 350m 2004 263m by 1,740 million 2004 1,690 million ordinary shares, being the average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding own shares held under trust which have been treated as if they had been cancelled.
Underlying earnings per ordinary share have been calculated as follows: 2005 2004 Pence m Pence m profit attributable to equity holders of the parent 20.11 350 15.56 263 Exclude: Release of hedge reserves 25.97 452 Unrealised fair value changes to derivative contracts 19.83 345 Revaluation of trading assets and liabilities 4.49 78 Exchange differences and forecast changes relating to financial RRSPs 1.72 30 Include: Realised gain on settled derivative contracts 22.76 396 Less foreign exchange derivative gains carried forward in contract accounting 4.25 74 Related tax effect 2.13 37 Underlying earnings per ordinary share 24.14 420 15.56 263 Diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of 350m 2004 263m by 1,813 million 2004 1,747 million ordinary shares, being 1,740 million 2004 1,690 million as above, adjusted by the bonus element of existing share options of 73 million 2004 57 million.

To hedge the currency risk associated with a borrowing denominated in US$, the Group has currency derivatives designated as part of a fair value hedge.

Shareholders are able to redeem any number of their B Shares for cash or convert them into ordinary shares.
Any B Shares retained, attract a dividend of 75 per cent of LIBOR on the 0.1p nominal value of each share, paid on a twice-yearly basis, and have limited voting rights.
In certain circumstances the Company has the option to compulsorily redeem the B Shares, at any time if the aggregate number of B Shares in issue is less than ten per cent of the aggregate number of B Shares issued, or on the acquisition or capital restructuring of the Company.
On a return of capital on a winding-up, the holders of B Shares shall be entitled, in priority to any payment to the holders of ordinary shares, to the repayment of the nominal capital paid-up or credited as paid-up on the B Shares held by them, together with a sum equal to the outstanding preferential dividend which will have been accrued but not been paid until the date of return of capital.
Movements in the B Shares during the year were as follows: Nominal B Shares value of 0.01p m Authorised At January 1, and December 31, 2005 1,000,000,000,000 1,000 Issued and fully paid 1 At January 1, 2005 4,600,710,064 5 Shares issued 141,013,817,330 141 Shares converted into ordinary shares 87,425,228,890 87 Shares redeemed 51,638,258,304 52 At December 31, 2005 6,551,040,200 7 1 The adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 from January 1, 2005 has led to the reclassication of B Shares from equity to other financial liabilities.

For the UK dened benefit schemes, the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds, and employees are entitled to retirement benets based on their final salaries and length of service.
Overseas dened benefit schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans.
Additionally in the USA, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the Groups employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance benets for retired employees.
The valuations of the schemes are based on the most recent funding valuations, updated by the scheme actuaries to December 31, 2005.
The most recent funding valuations of the main UK schemes were: Rolls-Royce Pension Fund March 31, 2003 Rolls-Royce Group Pension Scheme April 5, 2004 Vickers Group Pension Scheme March 31, 2004 The principal actuarial assumptions used at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2005 2004 UK Overseas UK Overseas schemes schemes schemes schemes %% %% Rate of increase in salaries 4.4 3.4 4.4 2.4 1 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.6 0.2 2.6 0.2 Discount rate 4.7 5.3 5.3 5.7 Expected rate of return on scheme assets 6.2 7.0 6.6 7.3 Ination assumption 2.9 2.6 2.9 2.8 1 Benets accruing after April 5, 2005 are assumed to increase in payment at a rate of 2.1 per cent.
The mortality assumptions used for the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund the largest scheme in the Group are based upon actual recent mortality experiences of members within the scheme and also allow for future mortality improvements.
The future costs of healthcare benets are based on an assumed healthcare costs trend rate of nine per cent grading down to five per cent over seven years.
