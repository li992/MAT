Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 note 1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS The Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 15 March 2006 and the balance sheet was signed on the Boards behalf by P J Hill and J C Silver.
The Laird Group PLC is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the European Union IFRS and the principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2.
2 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical or deemed cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, that have been measured at fair value.
The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are fair value hedged are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million unless otherwise indicated.
IFRS1 permits companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS in the transition period.
These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of taking the following exemptions:  Business combinations prior to 1 January 2004 have not been restated to comply with IFRS3 Business Combinations.
 The revalued amounts for plant, property and equipment under previous GAAP have been deemed as cost under IFRS.
 Cumulative translation differences on foreign operations are deemed to be zero at 1 January 2004.
Any gains and losses recognised in the Group Income Statement on subsequent disposals of foreign operations will therefore exclude translation differences arising prior to 1 January 2004.
 IAS 32 and IAS 39 have been adopted from 1 January 2005, with no restatement of comparative information.
 The Group has applied IFRS 2 only in respect of equity settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on or before 1 January 2005.
Principal accounting policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the directors to make judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported income and expense during the reporting periods.
Although these judgements and assumptions are based on the directors best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results may differ from these estimates.
The accounting policies set out below have been used to prepare the financial information.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated Group comprises The Laird Group PLC the Group and all of its subsidiaries.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared as of the same reporting date as the parent, using consistent accounting policies.
Intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are included until the date on which the Group ceases to control them.
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of a business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of any assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group, plus any costs directly attributable to the combination.
The identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date.
The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, including those of an intangible and tangible nature, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
The Laird Group PLC 39 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2005 note 2 Accounting policies continued Currency translation The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries are prepared using its functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
The presentation currency of the Group is sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
In the Group accounts the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling using weighted average rates of exchange for the period.
Net investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising from retranslating opening net investments and the retained profits for the period of overseas subsidiaries, less exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against overseas investments, are shown as movements on reserves.
All other exchange differences are dealt with in the Income Statement for the period.
Exchange differences arising from 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of shareholders equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation, any cumulative exchange differences held in shareholders equity that relate to the disposed operation are transferred to the Income Statement.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received and excludes intra-group sales and value-added taxes and represents net invoice value.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Retirement benefit obligations Under IAS 19 the assets and liabilities of defined benefit pension plans are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet and the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension plans are recognised in the Income Statement as operating costs and interest costs respectively.
Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised immediately in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense SORIE.
The Groups accounting policy for pensions will apply the option allowed under IAS 19 to take actuarial gains and losses directly to equity through the SORIE in the period in which they occur.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation and is based on actuarial advice.
The assets of defined benefit plans are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet and the liabilities are recognised at present value using a high quality corporate bond rate.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they become payable.
Share based payments In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2, the expense recognised in the Income Statement relates to equity settled grants made after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on 1 January 2005.
The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP shares awarded is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP shares were awarded including market based performance conditions.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted.
Non-market company performance conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
No expense is recognised for grants that do not ultimately vest and charges previously made are reversed except that an expense is recognised for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided all the other performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the Income Statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms for an equity settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share based payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
40 The Laird Group PLC note 2 Accounting policies continued In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation or settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately.
Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets, including patents, trade secrets, brand names and customer relationships, are recognised separately from goodwill and capitalised at fair value and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives.
Amortisation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis.
The estimated useful life of an intangible asset ranges between 3 and 17 years depending on its nature.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is expensed as it is incurred, except for certain development costs, which are capitalised as intangible assets when it is probable that the development project will be commercially viable, and certain criteria, including commercial and technological feasibility have been met.
Intangible assets arising in this manner are amortised over their useful economic lives, from the product launch date, which is typically less than two years.
Intangible assets relating to products in the development phase, both internally generated and externally acquired, are subject to an impairment review at each balance sheet date, or earlier should indication of impairment arise.
Any impairment losses are written off immediately to income.
Goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill set off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Income taxes Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction effects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised: Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the Income Statement.
Dividends Dividends paid are charged to retained earnings on the earlier of the date of payment or the date on which they become a legal liability of the Company.
Interest Interest is recognised in the Income Statement using the effective interest method.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost comprises the purchase price and directly attributable costs, for example, initial delivery and handling costs and installation and assembly costs.
The Laird Group PLC 41 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2005 note 2 Accounting policies continued Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
For all other property, plant, and equipment depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate cost less residual values of the assets over their useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years or less Leasehold land and buildings 50 years or the lease term if less Computer equipment 5 years or less Motor vehicles 4 years Other plant and machinery 13 years or less A proportion of one years depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the Income Statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Leases Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
All other leases are treated as operating leases, and are expensed to the Income Statement as incurred.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in tangible fixed assets at fair value.
Each asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset.
The obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included as appropriate under current, or non-current, trade and other payables.
The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
Segment reporting The Groups primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments.
A business segment is a component of the Group that is engaged in providing a group of related products and is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is a component of the Group that operates within a particular economic environment and is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of components operating in other economic environments.
Exceptional items These items are presented within the relevant Income Statement category.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
Events which may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional include the restructuring of businesses, the integration of new businesses, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, and asset impairments.
Financial assets Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables.
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Where the time value of money is material, receivables are carried at amortised cost.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate i. e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced, with the amount of the loss recognised in the Income Statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
42 The Laird Group PLC note 2 Accounting policies continued Derivative financial assets are classified as held for trading, unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
These assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses in value being recognised in the Income Statement.
A financial asset or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where:  the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: or  the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value.
Measurement after initial recognition is at amortised cost, with the changes in the carrying amount being taken through the Income Statement.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Group may use derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
From 1 January 2005, such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the Income Statement.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For those contracts designated as hedges the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are tested, both at inception to ensure they are expected to be effective and periodically throughout their duration to assess continuing effectiveness.
Net investment hedges These are used to hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Groups interests in the net assets of foreign operations.
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the Income Statement.
Interest rate swaps The interest rate swap contract has not been designated as a hedge and gains or losses arising on this contract are taken to the Income Statement.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging for the year ended 31 December 2004 Comparative figures continue to be shown on a UK GAAP basis, as the Group has taken advantage of the IFRS 1 exemption, deferring the adoption of IAS 32 and 39 until 1 January 2005.
The accounting policy for financial instruments under UK GAAP was: Forward contracts are used to hedge foreign currency exposures arising on committed future transactions in foreign currencies.
The rates under such contracts are used to record the hedged item.
Interest differentials on interest rate swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable on an accruals basis.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value prior to maturity.
Net investment hedges are used to hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Groups interest in the net assets of foreign operations.
The Laird Group PLC 43 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2005 note 2 Accounting policies continued Treasury shares The Laird Group PLC shares held in the ESOP are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity in three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
For finished goods and work in progress, cost includes directly attributable costs and certain overhead expenses principally administration costs are excluded.
Net realisable value is determined as estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling, and distribution.
Provisions These comprise liabilities of uncertain timing or amount.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly announced on or before the balance sheet date.
Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is material.

Capitalised development expenditure is amortised on a straight line basis.
No development expenditure was capitalised in 2004 as the required documentation was not in place.
All amortisation charges for the year have been charged against operating profits.
The total amount of research and development activity expensed during 2005 is 13.4m 2004, 7.7m.
There is no indication of impairment for capitalised development costs.
Goodwill Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for indications of impairment in accordance with IAS 36.
No indications of impairment to goodwill were identified.
Only the Laird Technologies group of cash generating units have a significant carrying value of goodwill 277m 2004 245m, in comparison with the Groups total carrying amount of goodwill.
The remainder of goodwill is allocated across multiple cash generating units, and the amount allocated to each unit is not significant in comparison with the Groups total carrying amount of goodwill.
The aggregate carrying amount of goodwill allocated to these units is 45.5m.
All of the recoverable amounts are based on value in use.
For Laird Technologies the key assumptions were: Projected cash flows for 2006, 2007 and 2008 2004: 2005, 2006 and 2007 The equity market risk premium, calculated as 4% 2004, 5.0%.
This is an internally calculated figure, having been confirmed with external advisors as being reasonable Lairds beta, calculated as 1.3 2004, 1.2.
This is an internally calculated figure, having been confirmed with external advisors as being reasonable The Laird Group PLC 55 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2005 note 17 Intangible assets continued The forecasts provided are based on figures approved internally for the 2006 budget, which also include 2007 estimates.
Subsequent cash flows have been increased at a conservative rate estimate of 3% 2004, 3% per annum.
The cash flow figures were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.3% 2004, 11.6%.
Other acquired intangible assets Assets in this class are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis.
The following useful lives have been determined for acquired intangible assets: Brand names 5 years Trade secrets 8 to 15 years Trade marks and names 5 to 15 years Patents the remaining duration of the 17 year legal right Customer relationships 10 years The expected life assigned to acquired customer relationships is an estimate and is not secured by any legal obligation on the customer to continue business with the Group for any finite period.
Other than goodwill, the Group does not hold any intangible assets with an indefinite life.
18 Business combinations Acquisition of businesses The Group purchased four businesses during the year for a total consideration of 32.4m and all of these purchases have been accounted for as acquisitions.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
Book and fair values of the net assets of businesses acquired, stated at rates of exchange at the date of acquisition were as follows: Provisional fair Book values to the values Group m m Property, plant and equipment 2.4 2.4 Intangible assets 11.7 Deferred tax assets 0.2 0.2 Inventories 6.0 5.2 Trade and other receivables 6.4 6.4 Trade and other payables 3.8 3.8 Income tax payable 0.5 0.5 Deferred tax liabilities 1.0 1.0 Net assets acquired 9.7 20.6 Goodwill arising on acquisition 11.8 Consideration 32.4 Consideration satisfied by: Cash consideration including transaction costs 34.3 Deferred cash consideration 2.7 Net cash acquired 4.9 32.1 Borrowings acquired 0.3 32.4 The fair values assigned to acquisitions made in the year are provisional and may change during 2006.
56 The Laird Group PLC note 18 Business combinations continued Cateron Corporation, a Taiwanese based supplier of EMI shielding, gaskets and tape, was acquired for a cash consideration at an average exchange rate of 13.4m in January 2005.
Securidor Limited, a UK based manufacturer of composite doors, was acquired for a cash consideration of 4.2m in May 2005.
Builders Hardware Inc. a supplier of window and door hardware in the USA, was acquired for a cash consideration of 5.6m in September 2005.
Melcor Corporation, a US based manufacturer of thermoelectric modules and cooling systems, was acquired for a cash consideration of 10.8m in October 2005.
The Group has acquired a 100% interest in all of the above acquisitions.
Caterons business operations have been integrated into Laird Technologies.
Profit before tax of the other entities acquired in the period total 0.9m since acquisition.
If the acquisitions noted above had been held for the full year revenues from continuing operations for the Group would have been 14.0m higher, at 504.3m and profit before tax from continuing operations would have been 1.4m higher, at 35.7m.
There have been changes made during 2005 to the provisional fair values of 164.1m assigned to acquisitions made in 2004 and deferred consideration arising from prior year earn out agreements.
The effect of these changes was to increase goodwill carried forward at 31 December 2005 by 1.2m.
Details of all significant subsidiaries held by the Group are disclosed in the list of Principal subsidiaries on page 80.

Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Interest rate swaps The Group holds an interest rate swap contract to manage interest rate exposure with an underlying notional principal amount of $70m.
The contract is disclosed in accordance with IAS 32 and accounted for in accordance with IAS 39.
The contract has not been designated as a hedge and the decrease in the fair value during 2005 of 1.1m, has been taken to the Income Statement.
The unrecognised loss in 2004 was 0.4m.

The actual translation effects on cross border transactions which involve the sale of goods and services in currencies foreign to a Group entity are not significant taking into account that a number of currencies are pegged to the US dollar.
The Groups policy is for subsidiaries to take out forward foreign exchange contracts to cover their net transaction exposures to foreign currencies.
The Groups Chinese entities are not permitted to make loans to other Group entities outside China but distributions are permitted from audited reserves.
The Group does not have any significant transactional currency exposures on financial assets and liabilities on which net currency gains and losses would be recognised in the Income Statement.
Net investment hedging Included in borrowings are US $170.0m of debt 99.0m which have been designated as a hedge of the net investments in the United States subsidiaries and Czk 351.4m 8.3m designated as a hedge of the net investment in the Czech Republic subsidiary.
These amounts are being used to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on these investments.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.

Net borrowings: EBITDA ratio Net borrowings must not exceed 3.5 times earnings before depreciation, amortisation, exceptional items, interest and tax.
Consolidated net worth The ratio of consolidated net worth must not exceed 1.25.
Net worth is defined as Shareholders funds plus goodwill amortised or written off since 31 December 1995.

The fair value of LTIP shares awarded is estimated as at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIPs shares were awarded including the market based performance conditions set out in the Directors remuneration report.
The fair value of share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted.
The non-market company performance conditions set out in the Directors remuneration report are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
The weighted average fair value of LTIP awards during the year was 195p 2004, 177p and of share options granted during the year was 108p 2004, 92p.

The expected volatility of the LTIP shares is based on historical volatility: average of monthly activity over the last three years.
Expected volatility reflects the assumptions that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily prove to be the actual outcome.
Dividends are not payable on the LTIP shares prior to vesting and this is taken into account in calculating the fair value.
For the share option schemes, no allowance is considered necessary for leavers pre-vesting.

Certain subsidiary undertakings had contingent liabilities at 31 December 2005 in respect of hire of plant under leasing contracts.
36 Retirement benefit obligations Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes of both the defined benefit and defined contribution types.
Approximately 500 2004, 650 employees are members of seven different defined benefit schemes and these schemes have approximately 1,900 2004, 1,800 deferred and current pensioners.
The employer contributions made to these schemes during the year was 7.6m 2004, 2.2m.
The total assessed value of the schemes assets at 31 December 2005 at their market value is estimated at 78.2m 2004, 64.6m and the liabilities estimated at 94.6m 2004, 79.4m.
The resultant aggregate net pension liability under IAS 19 is 16.4m 2004, 14.8m.
Since last year equity markets have risen, however this increase has not been sufficient to offset reductions in corporate bond yields and higher longevity assumptions for the schemes members which impact upon the value of discounted liabilities, resulting in a higher aggregate net pension liability.
The market value of the schemes assets, the present value of the schemes liabilities and the net pension liability under IAS 19 at 31 December were as follows: 2005 2004 m m Annuities 10.2 10.4 Equities 41.6 34.8 Gilts and bonds 20.8 17.2 Other including cash 5.6 2.2 Total market value of assets 78.2 64.6 Present value of scheme liabilities 94.6 79.4 Deficit in the schemes 16.4 14.8 There are minor variations in the assumptions used by the different actuaries employed to value the separate schemes.
The expected long term rates of return on gilts and bonds are estimated at 4.4% per annum 2004, 4.6% and those for equities at 7.8% per annum 2004, 8.2%.
The returns on the annuities match the relevant liabilities.
The mortality assumption used at the year end is based on 92 series tables with a medium cohort allowance for future mortality improvements to 2015 for pensioners and 2025 for non-pensioners.
The future life expectancies are around 2 years longer than those assumed at the last year end.
For IAS 19 the schemes liabilities have been calculated under the projected unit method and the main financial assumptions were inflation of 2.75% per annum 2004, 2.7%, salary increases of 3.75% per annum 2004, 3.7% and a discount rate for liabilities of 4.75% per annum 2004, 5.4%.

The directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense from the date of inception of the company schemes to 31 December 2003.
The Group estimates that the total value of contributions to defined benefit plans will be 3.2m in 2006, which is expected to include 1.8m of additional contributions to be paid over and above normal contributions.
Within Sweden, the Group operates a plan, included within a multiemployer plan, for its employees which is insured with Alecta.
This scheme is a defined benefit plan, but Alecta is currently unable to provide sufficient information to report the Groups proportional share of the defined benefit commitments and the assets under management and expenses associated with the plan.
Consequently, Alecta cannot provide the information regarding the Groups proportional share of the surplus or deficit in the plan.
As a result the scheme is reported as if it were a defined contribution plan, although it is actually a defined benefit plan.

The loss on disposal of 13.8m was calculated after adding back 17.4m of goodwill that had previously been written off against reserves.
Any taxation cost in respect of discontinued operations was included within the taxation charge on the face of the primary statement.
Under IFRS the disclosure of operating profit, the gain loss on disposal, and the taxation relating to discontinued operations are shown in aggregate on the primary statement.
However, there is also a change to the results for the year under IFRS, as goodwill previously written off against reserves is not written back on the disposal of a business, increasing the result for the year by 17.4m.

Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
29.6m has been reclassified from goodwill to intangible assets in accordance with the transition to IFRS 3.
This is partly offset by an 8.0m adjustment which increases goodwill in respect of deferred taxation of the intangible assets to be amortised.
The net adjustment to goodwill is a reduction of 10.4m.

Under IFRS, 29.6m of acquired intangible assets, including patents, trade secrets and trade marks are recognised separately from goodwill, capitalised at fair value and amortised over their estimated economic useful lives.
The amortisation charge in 2004 was 1.2m and 0.8m after tax and results in a balance of 28.4m as at 31 December 2004. d Share based payments Under UK GAAP no expense was recognised for equity settled share based remuneration.
Under IFRS an expense is recognised and is based on the fair value as determined by reference to appropriate option pricing models for all such share based remuneration granted after the transition date of 7 November 2002.
A prior year adjustment to the balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 of 0.6m of deferred tax in respect of share based payments, was necessary.
There is a charge in 2004 resulting in a reduction in profit before tax of 0.8m and 0.5m net of taxation for the 2004 financial year.

There is no impact on the income statement as any charge or credit is recorded in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
An additional 8.2m of deferred tax liabilities also arise from the reclassification of elements of goodwill to specific intangible assets, in accordance with IFRS 3.
As at As at 31.12.04 1.01.04 UK GAAP deferred tax 7.5 4.0 Adjustments to IFRS Share based payments 1.1 0.6 Property revaluation 0.6 0.8 Goodwill amortisation 2.8 Pension deficit 1.9 1.4 Intangible asset amortisation 0.4 Intangible asset 8.2 8.2 1.2 15.7 2.8 f Dividends Under UK GAAP, dividends are accrued on the balance sheet when they are proposed by the Board.
Under IFRS dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
Therefore, only dividends approved in 2004, equivalent to those paid in the period, are charged in 2004 with the result that the final proposed dividend in respect of 2003 amounting to 8.0m is added back to Equity Shareholders Funds at 1 January 2004 and 9.5m is added back at 31 December 2004 in respect of the final proposed dividend of 2004. g Research and development The Group did not capitalise research and development expenditure under UK GAAP.
Under IFRS, the Group will be required to capitalise development expenditure if certain criteria, which will include assessing that projects are commercially viable and that the same has been documented, have been met.
No adjustment is necessary for 2004 as the required documentation was not in place, but development expenditure on a number of projects have been capitalised in 2005. h Financial instruments IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement were adopted on 1 January 2005.
For the year ended 31 December 2004 there is no impact on the financial statements.
However, between 31 December 2004 and 1 January 2005 there was a 0.4m reduction in Equity Shareholders Funds to reflect transitional adjustments in respect of fair value.
