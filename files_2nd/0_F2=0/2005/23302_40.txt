In pursuit of this objective, the Company may be exposed to various forms of risk, as described below.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Investments held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies Cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations Debenture stocks The risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk, which comprises interest rate risk, equity price changes and foreign currency exposure, liquidity risk and counterparty credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Short-term debtors and other short-term creditors are excluded from the following analyses.
Market risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
At each Board meeting the Board considers the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Investment Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk-reward profile.
The Company has the option to invest up to 200m of the debenture stocks in the equity market.
In a rising market the Company would benefit, but in a falling market the impact would be severe.
In order to manage the level of gearing, the Investment Manager invests part of the assets available in the Fidelity Institutional Cash Fund and short-term cash deposits.
This controls the level of net gearing.
As mentioned in the Chairmans statement on page 3 the current policy is that only 90m to 130m of the debenture stocks is invested in the equity market.
Long and short futures positions have been used during the year as a quick and effective means to either increase or decrease the Companys exposure to the equity market.
Due to the movement of markets in the year transactions in short futures have resulted in realised capital losses of 260,000 2004: losses 3,452,000 and transactions in long futures have resulted in capital gains of 19,000 2004: nil.
The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2005 Page 39 Notes to the Accounts Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are stated in the balance sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values, with the exception of the long term fixed rate debenture stocks, whose fair value as at 31 March 2005 has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the stocks and is set out below.
2005 2004 fair value book value fair value book value 000 000 000 000 1 11 % debenture stock 2014 138,555 100,000 142,652 100,000 2 3 7 % debenture stock 2022 121,624 100,000 121,218 100,000 4 260,179 200,000 263,870 200,000 Interest rate risk All of the Companys long term debt is fixed rate which exposes the Company to changes in market value in the event that the debt is repaid before maturity.
The debenture stocks in issue provide secure long term funding while short term flexibility is achieved through overdraft facilities.
Information on the debenture stocks is provided in note 12.
The Companys financial assets are mainly invested in equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date.
The Company also has substantial cash balances of 23,675,000 2004: 6,122,000 and is therefore exposed to movements in interest rates.
The rate of interest on the cash balances at the year end was 4.325% 2004: 3.6875%.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions.
The interest profile of the Companys financial liabilities, excluding short-term creditors, as at 31 March 2005 and 2004 was as follows: Currency 2005 2004 fixed rate fixed rate financial liabilities financial liabilities 000 000 UK Sterling 200,000 200,000 Currency 2005 2004 weighted weighted average average interest interest rate rate UK Sterling 9.625% 9.625% Currency 2005 2004 fixed rate financial fixed rate financial liabilities: weighted liabilities: weighted average period for average period for which rate is fixed which rate is fixed UK Sterling 160.5 months 172.5 months Foreign currency risk The Companys total return and balance sheet can be affected by foreign exchange movements because the Company has some assets and income which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys base currency sterling.
The Board have identified three principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affecting the value of investments Movements in rates affecting short-term timing differences Movements in rates affecting the income received The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments or other net assets priced in other currencies by the use of derivatives.
Page 40 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the Accounts The Company might also be subject to short-term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.

Short-term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
Details of the Companys borrowing commitments are explained in note 12 to the accounts.
The maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 March 2005 and 2004 is as follows: 2005 2004 000 000 In more than five years 200,000 200,000 200,000 200,000 The Company is invested in the Fidelity Institutional Cash Fund plc Sterling Fund the Fund.
The Fund endeavours to maintain a Triple A rating AAA and an MR1 rating by Moodys.
The Fund will be invested in low risk short-term investments and accordingly will carry a low degree of risk.
The Fund will invest in instruments whose maturity or interest rate refixing date is less than one year.
It is expected that the average maturity will generally be under sixty days.
The Fund may invest in bankers acceptances, certificates of deposit fixed and variable, promissory notes master notes, commercial paper fixed and variable, floating rate notes, medium term notes, securities issued by the government primarily of an EU member state or any other OECD government including supra-national entities and securities or discount notes issued by agencies backed by such governments or supra-national entities and securities issued by non-government institutions.
The Investment Manager receives a management fee capped at 0.15% of the net asset value of the Fund.
Counterparty risk Certain transactions in securities that the Company enters into expose it to the risk that the counterparty will not deliver either the shares on a purchase or the cash on a sale after the Company has fulfilled its responsibilities.
The Company buys and sells investments on a delivery versus payment basis to manage risk.
The Company buys and sells investments only through brokers which have been approved by the Manager as an acceptable counterparty.
Additionally, limits are set as to the maximum exposure to any broker at any time, the limits being reviewed on a regular basis.
