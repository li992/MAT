24 Trade and Other Receivables 2005 2004 000 000 Trade receivables 144,209 69,515 Other receivables 16,340 12,979 Prepayments and accrued income 15,782 8,554 Conference costs in advance 11,368 7,165 187,699 98,213 The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 30 days.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of 13,563,000 2004: 8,716,000.
This allowance has been determined by references to past default experience.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
Credit Risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, prepayments and accrued income, derivative financial instruments and investments, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables, and prepayments and accrued income.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for balance sheet purposes: 2005 2004 000 000 Deferred tax liability 240,431 101,901 Deferred tax asset 13,106 40,098 227,325 61,803 At 31 December 2005, the Group has unused tax losses of 8,856,000 2004: nil available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset of 3,720,000 2004: nil has been recognised in respect of these losses.
On the combination of Informa Group plc and Taylor & Francis Group plc on 10 May 2004 a deferred tax liability of 101,901,000 in respect of intangible and other assets, excluding goodwill, was recognised with a corresponding increase in goodwill.
During 2005, a further deferred tax liability of 146,500,000 was recognised in respect of the acquisitions of IIR Holdings Limited 143,370,000 and Ashley Publications Limited 3,130,000.
At the Balance Sheet date, the aggregate amount of post-acquisition undistributed earnings for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 161,894,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.
