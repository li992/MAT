Of the total deferred tax assets, 64m 2004: 36m are receivable within one year.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balance net.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised where it is probable that they will be recovered.
In recognising deferred tax assets, the Group has considered if it is more likely than not that suf cient future pro ts will be available to absorb tax losses and other timing differences.
Deferred tax assets of 37m 2004: 54m have not been recognised in respect of losses, tax credits on dividends and other timing differences due to the uncertainty of the availability of suitable pro ts in the foreseeable future.

There is no expiry date on either of these items.
No deferred tax has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates.
