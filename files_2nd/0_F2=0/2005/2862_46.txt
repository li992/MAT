10697 Capita 2005 back 14 3 06 09:54 Page 78 78 Capita Notes to the consolidated financial statements 18 Business combinations continued The business has been merged within the existing operations of the Group but its profitability is visible in that merged operation.
The Group is therefore able to disclose post acquisition performance of the acquisition although it is not possible to determine post acquisition cash inows.
Personal Pensions Management Limited On 30 June 2004 the Group acquired Personal Pensions Management Limited for a cash consideration of 9.0m.
The Group acquired tangible xed assets of 0.1m fair value 0.1m, debtors of 1.3m fair value 1.3m, creditors, including taxation of 1.1m fair value 1.4m and cash in hand of 1.3m.
The company had been loss making in 2003 due to a high operational cost base and the unaudited management accounts for the period 1 January 2004 to the effective date of acquisition show a loss on ordinary activities after taxation of 1.2m.
Since acquisition Capita has initiated a cost and service improvement programme and believe that profitability will be achieved in 2005.
The subsidiary acquired during the year resulted in net operating activities inows of 4.2m for the Group and outows of 0.6m in respect of taxation.
Other acquisitions in the year include Brownsword Limited and Learnhow Publications for an aggregate consideration of 9.8m, satisfied by cash of 9.4m including deferred consideration of 0.3m and the issue of 0.4m of loan notes.
The Group acquired tangible xed assets of 0.5m fair value nil, intangible xed assets of 2.5m fair value nil, debtors of 1.5m fair value 1.5m, creditors, including taxation of 1.5m fair value 1.3m, long term debt of 3.6m and overdraft of 0.4m.
Other acquired businesses have been completely integrated within the existing businesses of the Group and consequently it is not possible to determine post acquisition results of the businesses.
During 2004, a further 4.4m deferred consideration became due on the acquisition of Capita Life & Pensions Services Limited.
This had been provided along with a further 0.6m in respect of other previous acquisitions and disclosed as deferred consideration payable in the comparative period.
The consideration was settled in cash.
The fair value adjustments reect the Groups estimate of the fair value of intangible assets, xed assets acquired, and estimates of the recoverability of debtors and liabilities in respect of accruals.
Intangible xed assets relate to goodwill on the acquired companies balance sheets and hence are written off on acquisition.
There were no significant impacts on deferred taxation in relation to the fair value adjustments.
