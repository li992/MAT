In accordance with accounting standards, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its xed assets.
A review was undertaken at 31 March 2005 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by the net present value of future cash ows derived from assets using cash ow projections for each asset in respect of the period to 31 March 2015.
The Group prepares and internally approves formal ten year plans for its businesses and uses these as the basis for its impairment reviews.
The plans include cash ow projections for the mobile businesses which reect continuing investment in network infrastructure to provide enhanced voice and data products and services, which are forecast to be significant drivers of future revenue growth.
Capital expenditure is heaviest in the early years of the projections but is forecast to fall to 10% of revenue at Group level by the year ending 31 March 2008.
Revenue growth is forecast from a combination of new customers and enhanced customer propositions.
Data revenue is forecast to grow strongly throughout the ten year plan period.
Voice revenue is forecast to benefit in the longer term from enhanced service offerings and trafc moving from xed networks to mobile networks following a period of stabilisation reecting the impact of price declines.
Accordingly, the directors believe that it is appropriate to use projections in excess of five years.
For the years beyond 1 April 2015, forecast growth rates for mobile businesses do not exceed nominal GDP, using rates from independent sources, and are below nominal GDP for non-mobile businesses.
The discount rates for the major markets reviewed were based on company specic pre-tax weighted average cost of capital percentages and ranged from 8.3% to 11.6%.
The results of the review undertaken at 31 March 2005 indicated that an impairment charge of 315 million was necessary in respect of goodwill held in relation to Vodafone Sweden see note 4.
