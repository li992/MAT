Statement of Directors responsibilities in respect of the preparation of the financial statements The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the statement of auditors responsibilities included in the report of the auditors set out on the following page, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and the auditors in relation to the financial statements.
The Directors are required by the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of BHP Billiton Plc and the BHP Billiton Group at the end of the period and of the profit and loss for the period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the BHP Billiton Group will continue in business for the foreseeable future.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of BHP Billiton Plc, and which enable the Directors to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the BHP Billiton Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
