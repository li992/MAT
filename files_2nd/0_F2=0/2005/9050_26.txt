Provision has been made for all deferred tax assets and liabilities in respect of accelerated capital allowances and other material timing differences.
These deferred tax assets and liabilities have been discounted to reflect the time value of money over the period between the balance sheet date and the dates on which it is estimated that the underlying timing differences will reverse.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the group, no tax is expected to be payable in the foreseeable future.

f Currency exposures The group may borrow in appropriate foreign currencies in order to mitigate the effects of the currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas.
The foreign exchange exposure on the translation into sterling of the net assets of Aquarion, which are denominated in US dollars, is hedged by a mixture of US dollar currency swaps and forward contracts.
Gains and losses arising on net investments overseas and the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
There are no currency exposures on short term debtors and creditors or monetary assets and liabilities giving rise to a profit and loss account charge.
g Hedges The groups policy is to hedge interest rate risk within approved board policies and guidelines.
Interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and collars and forward rate agreements are used to manage interest rate exposure under a policy that requires between 85% and 95% of Yorkshire Water Services Limiteds net debt and 70% and 95% of Kelda Group plcs net debt to be held at fixed rates.
At the financial year end the proportions were 85% and 73% respectively.

PENSIONS UK PENSION SCHEME The group sponsors a UK pension scheme, called the Kelda Group Pension Plan KGPP.
The KGPP has a number of benefit categories providing benefits on a defined benefit basis and one category providing benefits on a defined contribution basis.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the KGPP was carried out as at 31 March 2004 when the market value of assets was 500.0m.
Using the assumptions adopted for SSAP 24, the market value of the assets represented 96% of the value of the accrued benefits, after allowing for expected future earnings increases.
The worsening in the funding level from that disclosed in last years accounts of 107.5% is primarily a result of the adverse changes in financial conditions experienced since the last actuarial valuation in 2001.
The UK pension cost under SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs for KGPP has been assessed in accordance with the advice of Mercer Human Resource Consulting, using the projected unit method.
For this purpose, the actuarial assumptions adopted are based upon investment growth of 7.6% per annum, preretirement and 5.6% per annum post-retirement, pay growth of 4% per annum and increases to pensions in payment and deferred pensions of 2.8% per annum.
The actuarial value of the assets was taken as the market value of the assets.
In deriving the pension costs under SSAP 24, the deficit is being spread over the future working lifetime of the existing members.
Contributions over the year ended 31 March 2005 were paid by members at 1.5%, 3%, 3.5%, 4%, 4.5%, 5% or 6% of pensionable pay depending on benefit category.
The company contributed at 200% of members contributions during the accounting year in respect of the majority of members.
Following on from the results of the 31 March 2004 actuarial valuation, the employer has agreed to increase its contributions to 475% of members contributions with effect from 1 April 2005.
The employers contributions have been assessed in accordance with the advice of Mercer Human Resource Consulting using different assumptions to those described above.
The total pension cost for the period was 9.2m.
A provision of 2.8m is included in the balance sheet at 31 March 2005.
An accrual for unfunded benefits of 2.3m 2004: 2.1m has been included in the groups accounts at 31 March 2005.
US PENSION SCHEME Aquarion in the US operates a number of non contributory defined benefit retirement plans.
The principal retirement plans relate to Aquarion company, employees of the American Water Works companies and employees of Aquarion Services Company.
Aquarion also provides healthcare benefits for certain categories of employees.
The latest valuations of the US schemes were carried out at 31 December 2004.
The market value of assets of the principal retirement plans was $71.0m 2004: $65.3m representing a deficit of $2.5m 2004: $0.9m over the benefit obligations at that date.
The benefit obligation of the post retirement healthcare plans exceeded the market value of assets by $28.7m 2004: $23.2m.
The Aquarion pension assets and liabilities have been recorded at fair value on acquisition and full provision for the post retirement healthcare benefit obligations has been made in the groups accounts at 31 March 2005.
The Groups total pension charge for the year was 11.4m 2004: 13.3m.

A qualified independent actuary has updated the most recent valuations of the principal schemes to 31 March 2005.

Pension increases in the US apply only to certain members of the Aquarion Services Company Pension Plan.
The market values of the assets and the FRS 17 value of liabilities of KGPP and the principal US defined benefit plans at 31 March 2005, together with the expected long term rates of return, were as follows: 2005 UK US EXPECTED LONG EXPECTED LONG MARKET TERM RATE OF MARKET TERM RATE OF VALUE RETURN VALUE RETURN m %m % Market value of assets Equities 379.5 7.30 27.5 7.55 Bonds 156.9 4.80 15.9 5.70 Other 12.0 4.55 0.4 4.80 548.4 43.8 Present value of scheme liabilities 626.8 67.1 Pension deficit before deferred tax 78.4 23.3 Deferred tax 23.5 9.3 NET PENSION DEFICIT 54.9 14.0 2004 UK US EXPECTED LONG EXPECTED LONG MARKET TERM RATE OF MARKET TERM RATE OF VALUE RETURN VALUE RETURN m % m % Market value of assets Equities 426.0 7.35 25.7 7.50 Bonds 60.3 5.00 14.4 5.80 Other 14.0 4.60 2.1 4.75 500.3 42.2 Present value of scheme liabilities 587.0 60.5 Pension deficit before deferred tax 86.7 18.3 Deferred tax 26.0 7.3 NET PENSION DEFICIT 60.7 11.0 KELDA GROUP PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2005 69 Notes to the accounts continued YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 25.
