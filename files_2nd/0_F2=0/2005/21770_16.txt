a In order to analyse net interest by business segment, a transfer price is applied to the internal funding or liquidity requirement of each segment.
Interest rates used for transfer pricing have been determined to retain the interest rate risk within Treasury & Reserves.
Costs have been assigned to each segment based on resources consumed.
Transfer pricing in respect of mortgage origination by the Retail segment has been determined on the basis of market rates for such activity.
b Restructuring costs of 7.9m 2004: 14.6m and compensation costs of 38.7m 2004: 37.1m have not been allocated across business segments since they are the consequence of Group level decisions.
c Assets and liabilities have been allocated to Lending and Retail on the basis of the regulatory capital framework.
The segments are not allocated capital during the normal course of business, therefore segmental profits do not relate to these net assets.
The other significant unallocated items are deferred and current tax.
d Further details of segmental performance are provided in the Group Finance Directors Review on pages 10 to 17.

For other share schemes a Black-Scholes methodology is used to value options.
The expected volatility of share price applied in the option pricing models is based on historic Bradford & Bingley plc share price data over a period equivalent to the expected life of the scheme or since the date of otation 4 December 2000 if shorter.
Awards granted under the Executive Incentive Plan are granted based on performance in the preceding financial year.
The performance criteria include qualitative elements which are not determined until the award date i. e. after the end of the relevant financial year.
The grant date therefore occurs after the employees to whom the award is made have begun providing services.
In accordance with IFRS 2 the grant date fair value is initially estimated for the purposes of recognising the services received during the period between service commencement date and grant date.
The fair value is then revised once the actual grant date has been established.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 3.2722 2004: 2.9276.

The cost to the Group of the dened contribution scheme was 1.4m 2004: 2.7m and the cost to the Company was 1.1m 2004: 2.0m.
b Other post-retirement benets The Group provides healthcare benets to some of its pensioners.
The healthcare benets are provided through a post-retirement medical scheme into which the Company contributes 100% towards the cost of providing medical expense benets for members who retired before 1 January 1996 and 50% for members who retired after this date.
The total number of members of the scheme as at 31 December 2005 was 579 2004: 616.
Private medical costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualied actuary.
c Accounting treatment The Group accounts for post-retirement benefit costs in accordance with IAS 19 amended issued in December 2004.
The full net actuarial deficit is carried on the Group and Company Balance Sheets, and actuarial gains and losses are taken to the Group and Company retained earnings rather than being charged or credited in the Income Statement.
The actuarial loss recognised in the Group and Company retained earnings during the year was 26.0m 2004: 1.4m.
In respect of pension schemes, more than one employing Group entity contributes to the schemes.
As there is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net dened benefit cost to individual Group entities the net dened benefit cost is recognised in the Financial Statements of the Company being the sponsoring entity while other individual Group entities, in their individual Financial Statements, recognise a cost equal to their contributions payable for the period.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term return for the portfolio.
The principal assumptions made on life expectancy were for active members to use PA92 Base rated down by 3 years and for retired members PA92 Base unadjusted.

Post-retirement benefit obligations The net deficit in respect of post-retirement benefit obligations is carried on the Balance Sheet.
The value of this obligation is calculated by the Groups actuaries using the assumptions set out in note 28.
Share-based payment The Income Statement charge in respect of share-based payment arrangements is based on the fair value of awards as at the date of grant.
Further details of the Groups fair value methodology are provided in note 5.
Useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment and computer software Property, plant and equipment and computer software are capitalised and depreciated to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives.
The depreciation rates are disclosed in the accounting policies notes 1 m and 1 o.
Provisions Details of provisions are shown in note 29.
Effective interest rate Certain financial instruments are accounted for on an effective interest rate basis, under which the income or expense associated with the instrument is spread over the instruments expected life.
On a quarterly basis, models are reviewed to re-assess expected life by portfolio of products, based upon actual redemptions by product.
Fair values of financial instruments Certain financial instruments are carried at fair value.
Where a market exists, fair values are based on quoted market prices.
For instruments which do not have active markets, fair value is calculated using present value models: further detail of the methodology is provided in note 40 a.
Loan impairment The Group reviews its loan impairment on a quarterly basis.
Impairment models use historical loss experience to provide both probabilities of default and property forced sale discounts across a portfolio of products.
In addition management applies a risk weighted view on additional factors, such as specic fraud cases.
Related party disclosures The key management personnel of the Group and Company are the Companys Executive and Non-executive Directors and senior managers.
The Group and Company have related party relationships with the key management personnel and with the Groups pension schemes.

The above table shows the gains and losses on off-balance sheet derivative instruments used for hedging by the Group.
The gains and losses therefore do not represent absolute gains and losses expected by the Group as they will be substantially offset by corresponding losses or gains from on-balance sheet instruments.

In addition, certain loans to customers have been securitised, as explained in note 15. c Interest income and expense on financial instruments that are not at fair value through profit or loss During the year, total interest income and expense calculated using the effective interest rate method for financial assets and financial liabilities that are not at fair value through the profit or loss were: Group m Interest income 2,134.5 Interest expense 1,666.6 d Hedging and hedge effectiveness The fair values of hedges as at 31 December 2005 were as follows: Group Company m m Fair value hedges - derivatives 84.8 157.9 Cash ow hedges - derivatives 16.5 16.5 68.3 141.4 The Group undertakes derivative transactions to hedge risk exposures, and manages risk by use of fair value hedges and cash ow hedges.
For those transactions which qualify and are designated as fair value or cash ow hedges, hedge accounting treatment is applied.
Fair value hedges are primarily used to hedge against changes in fair value of xed rate products due to movements in market interest rates.
For the year ended 31 December 2005, the Group recognised fair value gains of 1.1m, representing the ineffective portion of the fair value hedges.
Cash ow hedges are used to hedge the risk of exposure to variability of cash ows attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a forecast transaction.
Any gains or losses on cash ow hedges are recorded in equity until the hedged cash ow occurs, whereupon they are transferred to profit or loss for the period.
As at 31 December 2005, net gains accumulated in equity were 15.8m and the ineffective portion of those hedges was Nil.
Hedge effectiveness is measured and assessed on an ongoing basis and was determined to be actually effective throughout the year.
Changes in fair values and cash ows of the hedged items were almost fully offset by changes in fair values and cash ows of the hedging instruments, and actual effectiveness was within a range of 80% to 125%.

f Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments The risks that the Group is exposed to and the Groups approach to risk management are discussed in the Group Finance Directors Review on pages 10 to 17.
Risks are managed on a Group basis, and hence a description of risk management policies is not provided separately for the Company.
Financial instruments used by the Group for risk management purposes include derivative instruments.
Such instruments are used only to limit the extent to which the Group will be affected by changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
As part of its responsibilities, the Groups Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO approves the use of specified derivative instruments within approved limits and business activities.
The Group does not undertake transactions for trading or speculative purposes, and consequently all of the Groups derivative instruments are for commercial hedging purposes.
Hedge accounting is applied as appropriate, as detailed in the accounting policies note 1 x.
The principal derivative instruments used by the Group in managing its Balance Sheet exposures are interest rate swaps, interest rate options, interest rate futures, crosscurrency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.
These are used to protect the Group from exposures arising principally from xed and capped rate mortgage lending, xed rate savings products, deposit funding, foreign currency exposure and investment activities.
The duration of derivative instruments is generally short to medium-term and their maturity prole reects the nature of exposures arising from underlying business activities.
Substantially all of the Groups derivatives activity is contracted with financial institutions.

iii Market risk Interest rate risk As at 31 December 2005 effective interest rates on financial instruments fell into the following ranges: Group Company %% Financial assets Loans and advances to banks 2.27-5.40 2.27-5.40 Loans and advances to customers 5.15-6.45 5.15-6.45 Debt securities 0.14-8.50 0.14-8.50 Financial liabilities Deposits by banks 2.16-4.77 2.16-4.77 Customer accounts 0.65-6.00 2.15-5.81 Debt securities in issue 0.01-8.18 0.01-8.18 Subordinated liabilities 5.83-8.37 5.83-8.37 Other capital instruments 6.32-6.57 6.32-6.57 The Group hedges xed rate and foreign currency balances into sterling oating rates.
The Group regularly measures its exposures to a range of interest rate scenarios.
Based on detailed underlying assumptions, at the end of 2005 the Group estimated the impact of a 1% fall in interest rates as an improvement in its forecast net interest income of 4m over the course of the following 12 months.
A positive interest rate sensitivity gap exists when more assets than liabilities re-price during a given period.
Although net interest income tends to benefit from a positive gap when interest rates are rising and suffer a negative gap when rates are falling, the actual effect will depend upon a number of factors, including the extent to which repayments are made earlier or later than the next reset or maturity date.
The carrying amount of derivative financial instruments, which are principally used to reduce the Groups exposure to interest movements, are included under the heading non-interest bearing.
