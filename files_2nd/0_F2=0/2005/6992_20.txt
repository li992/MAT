Payment of Dividends by BACS Many shareholders have already arranged for dividends to be paid by mandate directly to their bank or building society account.
The Company mandates dividends through the BACS Bankers Automated Clearing Services system.
The benefit to shareholders of the BACS payment method is that the Registrar posts the tax vouchers directly to them, whilst the dividend is credited on the payment date to the shareholders bank or building society account.
Shareholders who have not yet arranged for their dividends to be paid direct to their bank or building society account and wish to benefit from this service should request the Companys Registrar address below to send them a Dividend Interest mandate form or alternatively complete the mandate form attached to their dividend tax voucher.
