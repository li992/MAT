Pension commitments The Group operates two pension schemes providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Contributions to the schemes are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
Group Personal Pension Plan The Group provides a money purchase Group Personal Pension Plan.
The contributions to this arrangement plus payments in respect of death-in-service insurance premiums were 394,478 2004: 300,632.
There are no unpaid outstanding contributions in respect of the year.
Westbury Pension Scheme A formal valuation of the pension scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2003 by Watson Wyatt LLP.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
The rate of investment return on existing assets of the Scheme and on future contributions was assumed to be 7.1% per annum.
Additionally, it was assumed that salaries would increase at a rate of 4.0% per annum, pensions earned before 5 April 1997 would increase at a rate of 3% per annum and those earned after that date would increase at a rate of 2.5% per annum.
The market value of the Schemes investments at the effective date of the valuation was 28,401,000 and the results indicated that these assets represented 64% of the benefits which had accrued to members after allowing for future increases in earnings.
The pension cost charged to the profit and loss account has been calculated by Watson Wyatt LLP.
It is based on the actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2003 and, with the exception of future investment returns on both the existing assets of the Scheme and future contributions which have been assumed to be 7.6% per annum, all assumptions are the same as those used for the actuarial valuation.
The resulting pension cost comprises a regular cost of 5.9% of Pensionable Earnings to meet the normal accrual of benefits, plus for the first three months of the year an amount equivalent to 2.0% of Pensionable Earnings to cover the group PHI premiums that were payable from the Scheme for the same period.
Additionally an annual amount of 1,895,000 indexed with national average earnings in future years is required to meet the deficiency over the average remaining service lives of the contributing members, less the interest on the prepayment.
The contributions are determined by qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
Until June 2004 the Group contributed to the Scheme at a rate of 9.4% of Pensionable Earnings plus additional monthly contributions equivalent to 1,830,000 per annum, increasing each October in line with national average earnings.
Commencing from June 2004, the level of regular contributions was reduced to reflect that the group PHI premiums were not being paid by the Scheme.
This resulted in the Group contributing to the Scheme at a rate of 7.4% of Pensionable Earnings with no changes to the level of additional contributions.
These rates of contribution have increased the prepayment to 4,335,000 at 28 February 2005 2004: 3,827,000.
During the year to 28 February 2005, the Group met administrative costs of 366,629 2004: 268,862 on behalf of the pension arrangements.
At 28 February 2005 there were no outstanding unpaid contributions in respect of the year to that date 2004: nil.
Prowting Pension Scheme The most recent actuarial valuation of the Scheme for the purpose of calculating the employers pension costs was carried out as at 31 March 2003 by Mercer Human Resource Consulting, and the Attained Age method was used.
The Schemes assets were valued at market value.
The main assumptions used to determine the pension costs are rates of investment returns of 6.5% per annum pre-retirement and 5.5% per annum post-retirement for all members.
Further assumptions were Pensionable Salary increases of 4.0% per annum and pension increases of 3.0% per annum on pensions in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions.
Westbury plc Annual Report 2005 61 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 28 February 2005 20.
Pension commitments continued At the valuation date, the market value of the assets of the Scheme was 13,453,000, and this represented 81% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in salaries.
The funding position was reassessed in August 2003 by when the funding position had improved, with 88% of the value of the benefits covered by assets.
The employer contributed 10.9% of pensionable salaries into the Scheme until 1 February 2004.
From 1 February 2004 onwards the employer contributes 17.7% of pensionable salaries plus a monthly amount of 14,840 following the results of the actuarial valuation and the advice of the Scheme Actuary.
The pension cost for the employer for the financial year ended 28 February 2005 was 425,000 2004: 453,000.
FRS 17 disclosures The disclosures required under the transitional arrangements within FRS 17 Retirement Benefits have been calculated by independent actuaries based on the more recent full actuarial valuation at 5 April 2003 updated on 28 February 2005.
This applies to both the Westbury Pension Scheme and the Prowting Pension Scheme.

Westbury plc Annual Report 2005 65 IFRS STATEMENTS for the year ended 28 February 2005 Introduction The Board believe that it is best practice to inform shareholders of the potential impact of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS on the Groups results and net assets for the year ended 28 February 2005.
The figures on pages 67 to 69 and the Accounting policies on pages 70 to 72 are provisional at this time as the interpretation of IFRS is still developing.
Therefore it is possible that these results and accounting policies may change when applied in the Groups first full financial statements under IFRS.
Westbury currently prepares its primary financial statements under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
From March 2005 onwards the Group will be required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Accounting Standards IAS and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
This change applies to all financial reporting for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and consequently Westburys first IFRS results will be its interim results for the half year to 31 August 2005.
The Groups first Annual Report under IFRS will be for the year ending 28 February 2006.
As the Group publishes comparative information in its Annual Report for the prior year, the date for transition to IFRS is 1 March 2004, this being the start of the period for comparative information.
IFRS transitional arrangements and early adoption When preparing the Groups IFRS Balance Sheet at 29 February 2004, the date of transition, the following optional exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS accounting policies have been adopted: Business combinations the provisions of IFRS 3 have been applied with effect from 1 March 2005 resulting in goodwill not being restated on the transition to IFRS.
Employee benefits the accumulated actuarial gains and losses in respect of employee defined benefit plans have been recognised in full through reserves at 1 March 2004.
The Group has also opted to adopt the International Accounting Standards Board IASB amendments to IAS 19 early, allowing actuarial gains and losses to be charged to reserves in the period in which they arise.
Financial instruments the Group has chosen not to restate comparative information for IAS 32 and IAS 39.
These standards will be adopted prospectively from 1 March 2005.
Share based payments the Group has elected to apply the transitional arrangements and only shares granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005 have been fair valued.
Main impacts The main impacts of IFRS on the results and net assets are as follows: Share based payments to employees IFRS 2 requires an equity based transaction with employees to be fair valued at the grant date and an expense recognised over the vesting period based on the number of shares expected to vest.
Pension liability Under UK GAAP the Company accounted for pension arrangements under SSAP 24.
IAS 19 requires the pension liability to be disclosed in the balance sheet.
This is similar in treatment to FRS 17, with the exception that the scheme assets are required to be valued at bid rather than mid market prices.
In addition IAS 12 requires the deferred tax to be disclosed separately rather than used to reduce the liability.
The introduction of IAS 19 has a significant Balance Sheet impact but a small effect upon the Income Statement.
Discounting long term creditors In accordance with IAS 2 long term creditors are discounted.
The discount is charged to the Income Statement on an accrued basis or if the discount is project specific it is capitalised and amortised in line with sales.
Land creditors in the Balance Sheet for the year ended 28 February 2005 have been discounted and the discount applied to the stock balance, with no impact on the Income Statement.
Cessation of goodwill amortisation IFRS 3 requires goodwill to be carried at cost with impairment reviews carried out both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
In accordance with the transitional arrangements set out in IFRS 1 the amortised balance of goodwill as at 29 February 2004 has remained in the Balance Sheet at this figure, with no amortisation charge since this date.
Joint ventures In accordance with IAS 31 the equity method of accounting is used for all joint ventures and joint arrangements.
This has resulted in the reversal of the proportional consolidation of a joint arrangement in the Balance Sheet and the reclassification of the results of joint ventures into one line on the Income Statement.
Exclusion of proposed dividends IAS 10 provides that any dividends declared after the year end represents a non adjusting post balance sheet event and therefore no liability should be recognised.
The final dividend is therefore not included in the Income Statement or Balance Sheet.
