Related party transactions continued In December 2004 the group acquired, pursuant to a court sanctioned scheme of arrangement in terms of the South African Companies Act of 1973, all of the issued shares in ABI which were not already owned by the group, at a price per share of R91.
The Public Investment Commission PIC, which is the body which holds the assets of the South African government pension scheme, was at the time of the transaction deemed to be a related party of SABMiller in terms of the Listing Rules of the UKLA by virtue of its holding of shares entitling it to control the exercise of over 10% of the votes able to be cast at general meetings of SABMiller plc, and was also the holder of approximately 1.7% of the issued share capital of ABI, and accordingly received from the group a cash consideration of R236 million US$38 million for its ABI shareholding.
These shares were acquired from PIC pursuant to the scheme of arrangement on the same terms as those on which the shares of all the other minority shareholders in ABI were acquired.
During the year ended 31 March 2004 the group acquired a further 9.5% of Cervejas fide Moambique CDM from the Castel group, an associated undertaking of the SABMiller group, for a cash payment of US$7 million.
In an extension to the pan-African strategic alliance entered into by the group and the Castel group in 2001, the company announced on 18 March 2004 the establishment of two ventures with Castel.
The Algerian associate was effected by the group acquiring from Castel, in Algeria, a 25% direct interest in two Castel carbonated soft drink plants and one brewery, together with a 15.78% stake in a second brewery, in which Castel is the majority shareholder.
The Moroccan associate was effected by the group acquiring, from Castel, a 25% interest in a holding company which has controlling interests in three breweries, a malting plant and a wet depot, all of which are located in Morocco.
As a consequence of these investments by SABMiller and its existing 20% stake in Castels operations in Africa obtained at the time of the strategic alliance, these associates are effectively owned 60% by Castel and 40% by SABMiller.
Pursuant to the groups strategic alliance arrangements with Castel, transactions between the group and Castel, including the Algerian and Moroccan associates, are subject to the related party rules of the Listing Rules of the UKLA.
The day-to-day operations of the associates will be managed by Castel, which has a significant presence and expertise in French-speaking Africa.
