Notes to the group accounts 1 Accounting policies Statement of compliance The Group has adopted International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted for use in the EU in its consolidated accounts for accounting periods from 1 January 2005.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 have been prepared in accordance with all IFRSs, including Standing Interpretations Committee and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
In preparing this financial information, the Group has decided to adopt early the amendment issued in December 2004 to IAS 19 Employee Benefits Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures.
With effect from 1 January 2005 the Group has adopted IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39.
The effect of adopting IAS 39 at 1 January 2005 is presented as a movement in the Groups consolidated statement of recognised income and expense for 2005.
The financial information for the year to 31 December 2004 has been prepared on the same basis with the exception of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation IAS 32 and IAS 39 that have been applied from 1 January 2005.
The comparative financial information for financial assets and financial liabilities is accounted for on the basis of UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practices UK GAAP.
In general, for the first-time adoption of IFRS, the standards are applied retrospectively.
However, there are a number of exceptions available under IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 1 and details of the exceptions that the Group has applied are shown in note 36.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and, unless stated otherwise, rounded to the nearest million.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
Basis of consolidation The financial statements of the Group consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiary entities, and include its share of its joint ventures and associates results accounted for under the equity method, all of which are prepared to 31 December.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.
Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries include the special purpose entities that the Group transacted through for the provision of guarantees in respect of residual values and head lease and finance payments on certain regional aircraft sold.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of the acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
The results of such subsidiaries are included in the consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition, up to the date of disposal or closure.
Where the Group contributes a business, or other non-monetary assets for an interest in a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, such transactions are recorded so that the reduction in ownership of the business being contributed is accounted for as a disposal while the increased interest in the enlarged Group or new interest in the business contributed by other parties to the transaction are accounted for as an acquisition.
Fair values are applied to those operations which are subject to the exchange and which have not previously been held within the Group.
Any loss or realised gain resulting from the transaction is recorded in the income statement while any unrealised gain is eliminated against the investment.
Goodwill Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included in the carrying value of equity accounted investments.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
84 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 1 Accounting policies continued Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, as any amounts related to intangible assets that would have been recorded in the acquired entity if it had applied IAS 38 Intangible Assets at the date it was acquired by BAE Systems were considered immaterial, after being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment as required by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets IAS 36.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For intangible assets that are not yet available for use, and goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
The recoverable amount of assets carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at original effective interest rates.
Receivables with a short-term duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair value less cost to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on the Groups Integrated Business Plan and include a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of that plan.
This is considered appropriate due to the long-term nature of the defence industry.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10.46% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss in respect of assets, other than goodwill, carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
An impairment loss in respect of an equity investment classified as available for sale is not reversed through profit or loss.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
An impairment loss in respect of other assets is reversed if there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Revenue and profit recognition Sales include the Groups net share of sales of joint ventures and associates.
Revenue represents sales made by the Company and its subsidiary undertakings, excluding the Groups share of sales of joint ventures and associates.
Long-term contracts Sales are recognised as soon as the Group can reliably estimate the outcome of a long-term contract and has obtained the right to consideration in exchange for its performance.
This is usually when title passes or a separately identifiable phase milestone of a contract or development has been completed and accepted by the customer.
No profit is recognised on contracts until the outcome of the contract can be reliably estimated.
Profit is calculated by reference to reliable estimates of contract revenue and forecast costs after making suitable allowances for technical and other risks related to performance milestones yet to be achieved.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
Goods sold and services rendered Sales of goods and the provision of services not under a long-term contract are recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and revenue and costs can be reliably measured.
Profit is recognised at the time of sale.
Sales and profits on intercompany trading is generally determined on an arms length basis.
Lease income Rental income from aircraft operating leases is recognised in revenue on a straight line basis.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 85 Notes to the group accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies Transactions in overseas currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
These exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement unless they qualify for hedge accounting treatment, in which case the effective portion is recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
For consolidation purposes the assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary entities, joint ventures and associates are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income statements of such entities are translated at average rates of exchange during the year.
All resulting exchange differences including exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
Translation differences that arose before the transition date to IFRS are presented in equity but not as a separate component.
When a foreign operation is sold, the cumulative exchange differences recognised since the adoption of IFRS are recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on sale.
Research and development The Group undertakes research and development activities either on its own behalf or on behalf of customers.
Group funded expenditure on research activities is written off as incurred and charged to the income statement.
Group funded expenditure on development activities applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset if certain conditions are met.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and related overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over the expected life of the product.
Where the research and development activity is performed for customers, the revenue arising is recognised in accordance with the Groups revenue recognition policy above.
Other intangible assets Acquired computer software licences for use within the Group are capitalised as an intangible asset on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Group funded expenditure associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes for sale are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Capitalised software development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Trademarks and licences are stated at historical cost.
Trademarks and licences have definite useful lives and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets arising from a business combination are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Acquired computer software licences 2 to 5 years Capitalised software development 2 to 5 years Trademarks and licences up to 20 years Other intangibles 5 to 10 years 86 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 1 Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
Depreciation is provided, normally on a straight line basis, to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives to any estimated residual value, using the following rates: Buildings up to 50 years, or the lease term if shorter Research equipment 8 years Computing equipment, motor vehicles and short life works equipment 3 to 5 years Aircraft up to 15 years, or the lease term if shorter Other equipment 10 to 15 years, or the project life if shorter In the Groups North American businesses, depreciation is normally provided on a basis consistent with cost reimbursement profiles under US government contracts.
Typically this provides for a faster rate of depreciation than would otherwise arise on a straight line basis.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land and assets in the course of construction.
The assets residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Where applicable, useful lives reflect the component accounting principle.
Assets obtained under finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment and stated at an amount equal to the lower of the fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Investment property Land and buildings that are leased to non-group entities predominantly to joint ventures and associates are classified as investment property.
The Group applies the cost model to measure investment property at its cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided, normally on a straight line basis, to write off the cost of investment property over its estimated useful life of up to 50 years.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Other investments The Group determines the classification of its other investments at initial recognition depending on the purpose for which the investments were acquired.
The Group classifies its other investments as follows: a loans and receivables: term deposits, principally comprising funds held with banks and other financial institutions are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method: b at fair value through profit or loss: financial instruments held for trading or designated by management on initial recognition.
They are held at fair value and included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date: c held to maturity: non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Groups management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity.
During the year, the Group did not hold any investments in this category: d available for sale: investments other than interests in joint ventures and associates and term deposits.
They are held at fair value and included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade-date the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 87 Notes to the group accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the investments classified as at fair value through profit or loss are included in finance costs in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Unrealised gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale are recognised in equity.
When investments classified as availablefor-sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement as gains and losses from investment securities within finance costs.
The fair values of quoted investments are based on bid prices at the balance sheet date.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their amortised cost less impairment losses.
Amounts due from customers for contract work include long-term contract balances less attributable progress payments.
Long-term contract balances are stated at cost less provision for any anticipated losses.
Appropriate provisions for any losses are made in the year in which they are first foreseen.
The amount of profit attributable to the stage of completion of a long-term contract is arrived at by reference to the estimated overall profitability of the contract.
Progress payments are amounts received from customers in accordance with the terms of contracts which specify payments in advance of delivery and are credited, as progress payments, against any expenditure incurred for the particular contract.
Any unexpended balance in respect of progress payments is held in trade and other payables as customer stage payments or, if the amounts are subject to advance payment guarantees unrelated to company performance, as cash received on customers account.
Cash received on customers account is excluded from net debt as defined by the Group.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, including all relevant overhead expenditure, and net realisable value.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, call deposits and other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents also includes bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as assets held for sale and stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within a year from the classification.
In addition, the asset or disposal group is to be available for immediate sale in its present condition and is actively being marketed at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value.
Loans and overdrafts Loans and overdrafts are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and overdrafts are stated at amortised costs, or fair value where hedge accounting has been adopted, with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs in connection with the acquisition or construction of items of property, plant and equipment, investment property and inventories are not capitalised.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at their cost.
88 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 1 Accounting policies continued Leases Assets obtained under finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment at cost and are depreciated over their useful lives, or the lease term, whichever is the shorter.
Future instalments under such leases, net of financing costs, are included within loans.
Rental payments are apportioned between the finance element, which is included in finance costs, and the capital element, which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments, so as to give a constant charge on the outstanding obligation.
Payments, including any incentives, made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Assets held for leasing out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Rental income is recognised in revenue on a straight-line basis.
Assets leased out under finance leases cease to be recognised in the balance sheet after the inception of the lease.
Instead, a finance lease receivable, representing the discounted future lease payments to be received from the lessee plus any discounted unguaranteed residual value, is recorded as long-term financial assets.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the asset.
Financial instruments The global nature of the Groups business means it is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates.
In order to protect itself against currency fluctuations, the Groups policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures as well as to manage anticipated economic cash flow exposures over the medium term.
The Group also uses interest rate derivative instruments to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits by varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time horizon.
The Group aims to achieve hedge accounting treatment for all derivatives that hedge material foreign currency exposures and those interest rate exposures where hedge accounting can be achieved.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold derivative financial instruments for trading puposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
From 1 January 2005 the Group has adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39.
In accordance with IFRS 1, the Group is not required to restate comparative information but is required to present the comparative information according to previous local GAAP requirements.
Accordingly, the Group has presented its 2004 comparative information for financial instruments in accordance with FRS 13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures FRS 13 and FRS 4 Capital Instruments FRS 4.
The policies for the year ended 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004 are discussed below.
Further information on the impact of the change in accounting policy is given in the Changes in Accounting Policies note below.
Periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition, such instruments are stated at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction income or expense, the effective portion of any change in the fair value of the instrument is recognised directly in reserves.
Amounts recognised in reserves are recycled from reserves and recognised in the income statement when the underlying transaction affects profit or loss.
The ineffective portion of any change in the fair value of the instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability are recognised in the income statement for the period.
Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement for the period.
Period to 31 December 2004 The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
Instruments accounted for as hedges were designated as a hedge at the inception of contracts.
Receipts and payments on interest rate instruments were recognised on an accruals basis, over the life of the instrument.
Gains and losses on foreign currency hedges were recognised on maturity of the underlying transactions, other than translational hedges of foreign currency investments, net of related borrowings, which were taken to reserves.
Gains and loses arising from re-timing of foreign exchange transactional cover were deferred to match the maturity of the underlying exposure.
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments which were cancelled due to termination of underlying exposure were taken to the income statement immediately.
Finance costs associated with debt issuance were charged to the income statement over the life of the instruments.
Short-term receivables and payables that meet the definition of a financial asset or liability respectively had been excluded from the FRS 13 disclosures where permitted by that standard.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 89 Notes to the group accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and where it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products and services are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly announced.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
Provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when it becomes probable that total estimated contract costs will exceed total contract revenues.
Such provisions are recorded as write downs of work in progress for that portion of the work which has already been completed, and as liability provisions for the remainder.
Losses are determined on the basis of estimated results on completion of contracts and are updated regularly.
Employee benefits: Retirement benefit plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined periodically by independent actuaries and charged to the income statement in the period in which those benefits are earned by the employees.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, and are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent the benefits are already vested, or otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
90 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 1 Accounting policies continued Long-term service benefits: Equity and equity-related compensation benefits The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share options to employees.
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments IFRS 2, the Group has applied IFRS 2 to all equity-settled share options granted after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005 and all cash-settled options outstanding at the balance sheet date.
As explained in note 26, equity-settled share options are measured at fair value at the date of grant using an option pricing model.
The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will actually vest.
Cash-settled share options are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date using an option pricing model.
The Group recognises a liability at the balance sheet date based on these fair values, and taking into account the estimated number of the options that will actually vest and the relative completion of the vesting period.
Changes in the value of this liability are recognised in the income statement for the year.
Preference share capital The Group has in issue 7.75p net cumulative preference shares of 25p each that are convertible into the Groups ordinary shares of 2.5p each at the option of the holder on 31 May in any of the years up to 2007, on the basis of 0.47904 ordinary shares for every preference share.
From 1 July 2007 to 1 January 2010, the Group may redeem any outstanding shares at 100p per share, together with any arrears and accruals of dividends.
The Group has adopted IAS 32 with effect from 1 January 2005.
Accordingly, the Group has presented its 2004 comparative information for preference share capital in accordance with FRS 4.
Further information on the impact of the change in accounting policy is given below.
Periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 In accordance with IAS 32 the preference shares are considered a compound financial instrument and accordingly, have been split into an underlying debt instrument, classified within loans and overdrafts, and an equity conversion option, classified within equity.
The underlying debt instrument is presented on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the preference shares.
The equity conversion option is presented at its historic fair value, based on the date of original issue of the preference shares.
On conversion of a preference share into ordinary shares, the attributable amount of the equity component is reclassified to share capital and share premium.
From 1 July 2007, the option to convert into ordinary shares is extinguished, and accordingly the remaining balance on the equity conversion option will be transferred to the retained earnings reserve.
Dividends thereon are recognised in the income statement as finance costs.
Period to 31 December 2004 The preference shares are presented as a component of equity.
Dividends thereon are recognised as a deduction from reserves.
Dividends Equity dividends on ordinary share capital are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared.
Changes in accounting policies Adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 For accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 the Group is required to measure and disclose amounts defined as financial instruments in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39.
For periods ending 31 December 2004, the relevant UK GAAP standard and policy has been disclosed above.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 91 Notes to the group accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued The impact of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 on the Groups financial position is shown in note 36.
The impact of each of the adjustments is discussed below: Derivative financial instruments Under UK GAAP the fair value of financial instruments designated as hedging instruments were not separately recognised on the balance sheet as either a financial asset or financial liability.
The underlying assets and liabilities against which the hedging instruments had been designated were recorded at the appropriate hedge rate.
With the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005, the Group was required to restate its underlying hedged assets and liabilities at the prevailing balance sheet rate, and separately account for the fair value of the hedging instruments as either financial assets or financial liabilities.
All such instruments were measured at fair value as at the balance sheet date.
The impact of this change was an increase in the Groups net assets of 691m, represented by: m Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities in the Groups equity accounted investments 770 Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities in the Groups wholly-owned businesses net 14 Restate assets and liabilities previously stated at hedge rate to the balance sheet rate net 107 Recognise related deferred tax impacts 14 691 Exchangeable Bonds Under UK GAAP the Exchangeable Bonds note 20 were recorded at issue price less unamortised issue costs.
Following adoption of IAS 39, the Group determined that the option holders right to request to exchange their Bonds for the Exchange Property, represented by the Groups shareholding in Vodafone Group Plc note 15, was an embedded derivative.
Accordingly, this embedded derivative had to be separated from the underlying debt instrument, measured at fair value and accounted for separately within the balance sheet.
The fair values of the underlying debt instrument and the embedded derivative are determined as follows: Underlying debt instrument On adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, the underlying debt instrument is presented on a net present value basis within loans and overdrafts note 20.
At subsequent period ends, the value of the debt instrument continues to be presented on a net present value basis, with the amortisation charge being recognised in finance costs in the income statement, until the instrument is extinguished on conversion to the Exchange Property or maturity.
The impact of this change was a 24m reduction in the recorded value of the Exchangeable Bonds as at 1 January 2005.
Embedded derivative On adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, the value of the embedded derivative was calculated by reference to the market value of the Bonds at 1 January 2005, less the carrying value of the underlying debt instrument recognised at that date.
Subsequent movements in the fair value of the embedded derivative are recognised in finance costs in the income statement.
The impact of this change was the recognition of a 62m embedded derivative liability within other financial liabilities as at 1 January 2005.
92 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 1 Accounting policies continued Exchange Property Under UK GAAP, the value of the Exchange Property, representing the Groups shareholding in Vodafone Group Plc, was initially based on the issue price of the Exchangeable Bonds, which represented the realisable value to the Group.
The historical cost of the Exchange Property to the Group is negligible, creating an unrealised gain in equity.
Subsequent values were based on the market price of the Vodafone Group Plc shares.
Movements in the fair value of the Exchange Property were offset against the original unrealised gain within equity.
Cumulatively to 31 December 2004 the Group had recognised an unrealised gain of 636m directly in equity.
Following adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, the Group has designated the Exchange Property as at fair value through profit or loss.
Prospectively from 1 January 2005, movements in the fair value of the Exchange Property will be recognised in finance costs in the income statement.
There was no impact on the recognised value of the Exchange Property on adoption of IAS 39 at 1 January 2005, however the unrealised gain previously recognised within other reserves has been reclassified into the retained earnings reserve within equity.
Preference shares Under UK GAAP, the preference shares were treated as a component of equity, and the redemption value of 266m was recorded as the total of non-equity shareholders funds.
The preference shares allow the preference shareholders to convert their holding into ordinary shares of the Group on the basis of 0.47904 ordinary shares for every preference share on 31 May each year to 2007.
From 1 July 2007 to 1 January 2010, the Group may redeem all of the remaining preference shares at any time at 100p per share, together with any arrears and accruals of dividends.
Following adoption of IAS 32, the Group determined that the existence of the conversion option over the Groups ordinary shares meant the preference shares met the definition of a compound financial instrument, consisting of an underlying debt component and an equity conversion option.
Accordingly the equity conversion option had to be separated from the underlying debt instrument, measured at fair value at the date of issue of the preference shares and accounted for separately.
The fair values of the underlying debt instrument and equity conversion option were determined as follows: Underlying debt instrument The fair value of the liability component was calculated by discounting the value of the expected future cash flows under the terms of the instrument using a market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
The impact of this change was the recognition of a 223m loan within non-current liabilities as at 1 January 2005.
Equity option of convertible preference shares The equity option over the Groups ordinary shares was calculated as at the date of issue of the preference shares as the difference between the discounted value of the underlying debt instrument as at issue date and the net proceeds received on issue of the preference shares.
The value of the equity conversion option does not change other than where options have been extinguished.
The impact of this change was a net 12m increase in the total equity of the Group: m fide-recognition of amounts previously recorded within issued share capital 66 Recognition of fair value of equity conversion option 78 12 2 Critical accounting estimates and judgements An analysis and explanation of the accounting estimates and judgements used in producing this set of financial statements is made in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 38 to 40.
Since the interim report for the six months ended 30 June 2005, the Group has updated the mortality rates used in determining the obligations in relation to the US pension scheme.

9 Discontinued operations Eurosystems On 29 April 2005, the Group announced the completion of the Eurosystems transaction with Finmeccanica SpA.
The Eurosystems transaction comprised the sale of BAE Systems Avionics Limited and the UK communications business, and the dissolution of AMS, the 50 50 joint venture of BAE Systems and Finmeccanica.
BAE Systems Avionics Limited represented substantially all of the previously reported Avionics business group.
BAE Systems Avionics Limited and Galileo Avionica SpA merged to form a new Avionics business owned 75% by Finmeccanica and 25% by BAE Systems.
The Groups 25% interest in the newly merged business is subject to a put option exercisable by BAE Systems in the three month period from the beginning of June 2007 and a call option by Finmeccanica at any time to August 2007.
At completion, BAE Systems received net consideration of 374m, plus an 89m working capital adjustment.
BAE Systems will receive a further amount of 268m upon the exercise of either the put or call option over the remaining 25% stake.
Accordingly, the Group is treating the remaining amount of 233m, after discounting to the balance sheet date, as deferred consideration as it does not exercise any control or significant influence over the new Avionics business.
BAE Systems sold its UK communications business to Selenia Communications Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Finmeccanica, for 25m in cash.

The value of the Exchange Property was initially based on the issue price of the Exchangeable Bond note 20, which represented the realisable value to the Group.
The historical cost of the Exchange Property to the Group is negligible, creating an unrealised gain within equity under the previously applied UK GAAP.
Subsequent balance sheet values were based on the market price of the Vodafone Group Plc shares.
Movements in the fair value of the Exchange Property were set against the original unrealised gain within equity.
Following adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005, the Group has designated the Exchange Property as at fair value through profit or loss.
Prospectively from 1 January 2005, movements in the fair value of the Exchange Property are recognised in finance costs in the income statement.
Also, as a result of the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, the unrealised gain previously recognised within other reserves has been reclassified into retained earnings in equity note 27.

The Group has the option to redeem the US$500m floating rate note from August 2006.
The European Investment Bank borrowing consists of three sterling denominated loans, two of which mature in 2006 and the third during 2009.
The coupon rate on each loan is fixed with the weighted average interest rate on these loans being 6.86%.
The Alvis loan notes were issued to certain shareholders of Alvis plc as part of the consideration paid by the Group on acquisition of that company in 2004.
The notes pay a floating sterling rate of interest on the principal amount outstanding and are redeemable at par at the option of the holder on 31 December in any of the years up to 2009, at which time any outstanding balance will be redeemed by the Group.
112 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 20 Loans and overdrafts continued For more information on the debt instrument of the convertible preference shares refer to note 1.
The US$500m 4.75% bond, repayable 2010 was converted on issue to a floating rate bond by utilising an interest rate swap giving an effective rate during 2005 of 4.26%.
The US$1bn 6.4% bond, repayable 2011 was converted to a fully floating rate bond by utilising a series of interest rate swaps with different tenors: US$500m has been swapped until maturity of the bond in 2011, US$250m has been swapped until December 2007 and US$250m had been swapped until December 2005.
The effective interest rate during 2005 was 5.17%.
In December 2005 US$300m of floating to fixed interest rate swaps came into effect, which fixed the interest payment on this notional amount at a lower rate than the original coupon.
This resulted in the interest rate split on this bond at 31 December 2005 being US$550m fixed and US$450m floating.
The Class B and Class G certificates are repayable in 2011 and 2013 respectively with fixed US$ coupon rates of 7.156% and 6.664%, giving a weighted average interest rate of 6.879%.
At 31 December 2005, the gross outstanding principal due is $1,454m.
Of this balance $529m has been converted to a sterling floating rate bond by utilising a cross-currency swap which resulted in an effective interest rate during 2005 of 5.74% on this element.
The US$500m 7.5% bond, repayable 2027 was converted at issue to a sterling fixed rate bond by utilising a cross-currency swap and has an effective interest rate of 7.73%.
The debt related financial instruments represent the market value of certain interest rate and cross-currency derivatives which are specifically hedging loans disclosed within the above note.
These derivatives have been entered into specifically to manage the Groups exposure to foreign exchange or interest rate risk.
Exchangeable Bonds At any time prior to the expiry date the bondholders have the right to request to exchange their bonds for the Exchange Property, which is represented by the Groups holding in the ordinary share capital of Vodafone Group Plc.
This option within the Bond is classified as an embedded derivative under IAS 39.
Further information on the Exchange Property is given in note 1.
Following the adoption of IAS 39, the Bonds are now presented on a net present value basis instead of amortised cost.
Finance lease obligations The Group has a number of non-cancellable finance lease arrangements predominantly in respect of aircraft as part of the Commercial Aerospace business.
The maturity of these lease liabilities from the balance sheet date is shown below.

The principal plans in the UK and US are funded defined benefit plans and the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The plans in other countries are unfunded.
Pension plan valuations are regularly carried out by independent actuaries to determine pension costs for pension funding and to calculate the IAS 19 deficit.
The disclosures below relate to post-retirement benefit plans in the UK, US and other countries which are accounted for as defined benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19.
The valuations used for the IAS 19 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuation undertaken by independent qualified actuaries and updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the deficit of the plans at 31 December each year.
Plan assets are shown at the bid value at 31 December each year.
The plan in Germany relates to the arrangements for Atlas Elektronik GmbH.
The obligations for these arrangements have been presented as liabilities directly associated with non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale following the classification of Atlas Elektronik as a disposal group note 19.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit plans, under which certain employees are eligible to receive benefits after retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US.
These plans are generally unfunded.
The latest valuations of the principal plans, covering retiree medical and life insurance plans in certain US subsidiaries, were performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2005.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension plans.
114 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 22 Retirement benefit obligations continued The financial assumptions used to calculate liabilities for the principal plans were: UK US 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 % %% % %% Inflation rate 2.8 2.7 2.6 3.0 3.0 3.0 Rate of increase in salaries 3.8 3.7 3.6 5.8 5.8 5.4 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.6-2.8 2.5-3.0 2.6-3.0 Rate of increase for deferred pensions 2.8 2.7 2.6 n a n a n a Discount rate 4.8 5.3 5.5 5.8 5.9 6.3 Long-term healthcare cost increases n a n a n a 5.7 5.7 5.8 The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
The bid value of plan assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of plan liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, as at 31 December are shown in the tables below.
For its UK pension arrangements the Group has, for the purpose of calculating its liabilities as at 31 December 2005 used PA 92 medium cohort tables based on year of birth as published by the Institute of Actuaries for both pensioner and non-pensioner members in conjunction with the results of an investigation into the actual mortality experience of plan members 2004 PA92 medium cohort tables based on year of birth for non-pensioners and PA92 calendar year for pensioners.
For its US pension arrangements the mortality tables used for pensioners and non-pensioners are RP 2000 projected to 2006 2004 1983 GAM.
Both UK and US mortality tables are based on the latest mortality investigations and reflect an industry-wide recognition that life expectancies have improved.
The Group has a number of healthcare arrangements in the US.
The long-term healthcare cost increases shown in the table above are based on the assumptions that the increases are 10% in 2005 reducing to 5% by 2015 for pre-retirement and 11% in 2005 reducing to 5% for post-retirements.

As these plans are multi-employer plans the Group has allocated an appropriate share of the IAS 19 pension deficit to the equity accounted investments based upon a reasonable and consistent allocation method intended to reflect a reasonable approximation of the equity accounted investments share of the deficit.
The Groups share of the IAS 19 pension deficit allocated to the equity accounted investments is included in the balance sheet within equity accounted investments.

This is consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over time.
Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before expected return assumptions are determined for each asset class.
The overall expected return is established with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing.
Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.

As a result the Group has restated the amounts shown above to the appropriate exchange rate as at 1 January 2005.
In accordance with IFRS 1, the Group is not required to restate comparative information which is presented under UK GAAP.
The Group has provided residual value guarantees RVGs in respect of certain commercial aircraft sold.
At 31 December 2005 the Groups exposure to make future payments in respect of these arrangements was 460m 31 December 2004 755m.
Certain of these arrangements are covered by a Financial Risk Insurance Programme FRIP under which the Group would place reliance on insurance cover for the anticipated aircraft values if the guarantees were called.
After taking account of the FRIP and independent appraisal valuations the directors consider that the Groups net exposure to these guarantees is covered by the provisions held and the residual values of the related aircraft.
The Group is also exposed to actual and contingent liabilities arising from commercial aircraft financing and RVGs given by Saab AB and Airbus SAS.
Provision is made against the expected net exposures on a net present value basis within the accounts of Airbus and Saab.
The Groups share of such exposure is limited to its percentage shareholding in each of these equity accounted investments.
Guarantees and performance bonds The Group has entered into a number of guarantee and performance bond arrangements in the normal course of business.
Provision is made for any amounts that the directors consider may become payable under such arrangements.
Operating lease commitments where the Group is the lessee The Group leases various offices, factories, shipyards and aircraft under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases and associated future minimum sublease income are as follows: 2005 2004 Payments due: m m Not later than one year 66 125 Later than one year and not later than five years 273 258 Later than five years 552 493 891 876 Total of future minimum sublease income under non-cancellable subleases 118 133 Capital commitments Capital expenditure contracted for but not provided for in the accounts is as follows: 2005 2004 m m Property, plant and equipment 93 55 Intangible assets 8 2 101 57 Treasury contingent liabilities Treasury contingent liabilities are set out in note 32.

During the year 187,489 shares were converted for 89,814 ordinary shares.
The Group may redeem all of the remaining preference shares at any time after 1 July 2007 and, in any case, will redeem any remaining shares on 1 January 2010, in each case at 100p per share together with any arrears and accruals of dividend.
The maximum redemption value of the preference shares, ignoring any arrears or accruals of dividend, is therefore 266m.
As stated in note 1, the Group has adopted IAS 39 from 1 January 2005.
In accordance with IAS 32 the convertible preference shares are considered to be a compound financial instrument consisting of both a debt element and an equity component which require separate accounting treatment.
Under IAS 32, the equity option element of preference shares of 78m is included as a separate component of equity.
The debt component is recognised within loans and overdrafts note 20.
The preference shares carry voting rights at a general meeting of BAE Systems plc the Company only where the preferential dividend is six months or more in arrears, or where a motion is to be proposed which abrogates, varies or modifies the rights of the preference shareholders, or where a motion is to be proposed for the winding up of the Company.
On a winding up, holders of the preference shares are entitled, after repayment of the capital paid up on the Special Share and in priority to any payment to any other class of shareholder, to the return of amounts paid up or credited as paid up on the preference shares together with a premium of 75p per share, and all arrears of preferential dividends.
Special Share One Special Share of 1 in the Company is held on behalf of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry the Special Shareholder.
Certain parts of the Companys Articles of Association cannot be amended without the consent of the Special Shareholder.
These articles include the requirement that no foreign person, or foreign persons acting in concert, can have an interest in more than 15% of the Company, the requirement that the majority of the directors are British, and the requirement that the Chief Executive and any executive chairman are British citizens.
The effect of these requirements can also be amended by regulations made by the directors and approved by the Special Shareholder.
The Special Shareholder may require the Company at any time to redeem the Special Share at par or to convert the Special Share into one ordinary voting share.
The Special Shareholder is entitled to receive notice of and to attend general meetings and class meetings of the Companys shareholders but has no voting right, nor other rights, other than to speak in relation to any business in respect of the Special Share.

On adoption of IAS 32, and in accordance with IFRS 1, the Groups holding in these shares was designated as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss.
As a result from 1 January 2005, movements in the market value of these shares will be recorded through the income statement.
Accordingly, this has been reclassified into retained earnings note 1.

The ex-dividend date is 19 April 2006.
31 Acquisition of subsidiaries The Group made a number of acquisitions during the year, the most significant of which was of United Defense Industries, Inc. United Defense in the US.
The acquisitions took place throughout the year but if they had occurred on 1 January 2005, Group sales would have been 16.2bn and profit after tax would have been 0.6bn.
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2005 the acquisitions contributed profit after tax of nil to the Groups consolidated results.
United Defense On 24 June 2005, the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued share capital of United Defense, in the US, for a consideration of 2,205m.
Goodwill arising on consolidation amounted to 1,984m.
United Defense is a leader in the design, development and production of combat vehicles, artillery, naval guns, missile launchers and precision munitions used by the US Department of Defense and its allies worldwide and the largest US non-nuclear ship repair, modernisation, overhaul and conversion company.
With the combination of the existing RO Defence business, the acquisition of Alvis plc in 2004 and United Defense, the new global Land & Armaments business group is positioned to take advantage of the US Department of Defenses mission and funding outlook, which is expected to prioritise the evolutionary and affordable development of military platforms and the refurbishment and upgrade of existing systems.
The planned restructuring of the US Army is also likely to require an upgrade of the large inventory of Bradley and other United Defense vehicles.
The 2005 US defence budget and supplemental requests include approximately $1.3bn for resets and upgrades to the Bradley vehicle fleet.
Land & Armaments provides the Group with a significant position within the Future Combat Systems programme, the US Armys largest procurement programme, as well as enhanced opportunities on programmes such as the UKs Future Rapid Effect System and Swedens SEP and in the export market.
The acquisition complements existing US business in advanced electronic systems and sub-systems creating significant synergy potential.
It also allows for the further development of the Groups through-life support and services capabilities by adding to its operations the US Navys largest non-nuclear ship repair and overhaul contractor.
The opportunities presented by these circumstances do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets but represent much of the assessed value within the United Defense business supporting the recognised goodwill.
Provisional fair values have been assigned to the net assets acquired.
These will be amended as necessary in light of subsequent knowledge or events to the extent that these reflect conditions as at the date of acquisition.

AMS was the 50 50 joint venture of BAE Systems and Finmeccanica SpA which was dissolved as part of the Eurosystems transaction.
The acquisition of the OMC Group is part of the Groups investment in offset companies as it continues to develop a greater indigenous presence in Saudi Arabia.

Financial instruments comprise net debt note 29 together with other financial assets and other financial liabilities and other instruments deemed to be financial instruments under IAS 32 including non-current receivables, non-current payables and non-current provisions.
Hedging instruments The notional, or contracted, amounts of derivative financial instrument are shown below, analysed between foreign exchange contracts and interest rate contracts, classified by year of maturity.
At 31 December 2005 Not Between exceeding 1 year and More than 1 year 5 years 5 years Total Foreign exchange contracts m m m m Net forward sales purchase contracts US dollar 1,406 93 35 1,348 Euro 1,240 59 2 1,183 Other 20 136 156 146 170 33 9 Not Between exceeding 1 year and More than 1 year 5 years 5 years Total Interest rate contracts m m m m Interest rate swap contracts US dollar 437 466 903 Sterling 12 73 31 116 12 510 497 1,019 Not Between exceeding 1 year and More than 1 year 5 years 5 years Total Cross currency swap contracts m m m m Net forward sales purchase contracts US dollar 21 277 460 758 Euro 95 95 Other 135 135 21 47 460 528 Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of a financial instrument is the price at which one party would assume the rights and or duties of another party.
The fair values of financial instruments have been determined based on available market information at the balance sheet date, and the valuation methodologies listed below: the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by discounting the contracted forward values and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: the fair value of both interest rate and cross currency swaps are calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash flows and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: the fair value of loans and overdrafts has been estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market-based interest rates prevailing at 31 December.
Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at the balance sheet date may not be indicative of the amounts the Group would expect to realise in a current market environment.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 131 Notes to the group accounts continued 32 Financial risk management continued The following table compares the estimated fair values of the financial assets and liabilities to their carrying value at the balance sheet date.

Cash collateral payments can be required to be made periodically to the counterparty dependent upon the market value of these financial derivatives.
Cash deposited in this way is treated as a non-current receivable and at 31 December 2005 totalled 80m 2004 104m.
Committed undrawn borrowing facilities At 31 December 2005 the Group had a revolving credit facility RCF of 1.5bn, which expires in more than two years but less than five years 2004 1.5bn which expires in more than two years but less than five years.
The RCF was renewed during the year for five years with the ability for the Group to request two additional one year extensions prior to the first and second anniversaries of the facility.
In January 2006 the banks in the facility agreed to the first one year extension and as a result the facility will now expire in 2011.
The RCF remained undrawn throughout the year.
The Groups commercial paper programme is supported by the RCF with any amount outstanding reducing the amount that can be drawn down on the facility.
As at 31 December 2005, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper programme 2004 nil.
31 December 2004 Financial risk management For the period to 31 December 2004, the Group is reporting its comparative information on the basis of FRS 13 as required by IFRS1.
Financial instruments comprise net borrowings together with other instruments deemed to be financial instruments under FRS 13 including non-current receivables, non-current payables, provisions and own non-equity shares preference shares.
Disclosures dealt with in this note exclude current receivables and current payables where permitted by FRS 13 except for the analysis of net currency exposures.
Interest rate risk management At 31 December 2004, after taking account of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, the currency and interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group was as follows: Financial assets Financial assets Floating rate Fixed rate on which no interest financial assets financial assets is paid Total m m m m Currency Sterling 1,519 799 2,318 US dollar 133 60 256 449 Other 188 3 191 1,840 60 1,058 2,958 Floating rate financial assets attract interest at short-term interbank rates.
The average period until maturity for financial assets on which no interest is paid is two to ten years.
Fixed rate financial assets have a weighted average interest rate of 7.8% and a weighted average period to maturity of 10 years.
Interest bearing financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, other current investments, certain non-current investments and noncurrent receivables.
Financial assets on which no interest is paid include certain other current investments and non-current receivables.

Interest bearing financial liabilities comprise loans and overdrafts, as disclosed in note 20.
Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid primarily comprise non-current payables, and current and non-current provisions.
Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of loans and overdrafts at 31 December 2004 is set out in note 20.
Non-equity shares are redeemable on 1 January 2010.
For the other financial liabilities, note 23 gives an indication of the underlying liabilities which in general cover a period of between one and five years from the balance sheet date.
Currency exposure The analysis below shows the net monetary assets and liabilities of group companies that are not denominated in their functional currency and therefore give rise to exchange gains and losses in the profit and loss account as at 31 December 2004.
The amounts shown in the table take into account the effect of hedging instruments used to manage these exposures.
Functional currency Net currency monetary asset Sterling US dollar Other Total m m m m Sterling 15 6 21 US dollar 2 2 Total 215 6 23 Fair values The estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities were: Net carrying amount Estimated fair value 2004 2004 m m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations Current assets cash and cash equivalents 1,651 1,651 Current assets other investments 763 763 Loans and overdrafts 3,064 3,252 650 838 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the currency and interest rate profile Foreign exchange contracts 18 5 Interest rate contracts 19 Cross currency swaps 15 15 33 29 Other long-term liabilities assets Own non-equity shares 266 333 Non-current receivables 511 511 Non-current payables 464 464 Provisions 491 491 710 777 The fair values of quoted assets and borrowings are based on period end mid-market quoted prices.
The fair values of other borrowings and derivative financial instruments are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at 31 December.
134 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 32 Financial risk management continued Hedges Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
The table below shows the extent to which the Group has unrecognised gains and losses on financial instruments used as hedges at 31 December 2004.
Unrecognised gains and losses 2004 Gains Losses Net m m m At 1 January 150 129 21 Net movement in unrecognised gains and losses 32 7 25 At 31 December 118 122 4 Expected to be recognised in one year or less 61 81 20 In later years 57 41 16 118 122 4 Interest rate management The Group uses interest rate derivative financial instruments to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits by varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time horizon.
The Groups current interest rate management strategy is that a minimum of 25% and a maximum of 75% of debt is maintained at fixed interest rates.
Currency management The Groups principal currency exposure is the US dollar Sterling exchange rate.
Following the formation of Airbus SAS in 2001, the US dollar exposure arising from the sale of Airbus aircraft has been managed through the joint shareholder treasury committee.
Hedging decisions have to be unanimously approved by the shareholders in this committee.
BAE Systems continues to be fully hedged against its forecast five-year US dollar transactional and economic exposures.
The Group also has transactional currency exposure arising from exports supplies denominated in currencies other than the US dollar.
The Groups policy is to hedge such exposures where appropriate using forward contracts.
33 Related party transactions The Group has a related party relationship with its directors and key management as disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 57 to 74 and in note 7, its equity accounted investments note 14 and the pension plans note 22.
Transactions occur with the equity accounted investments in the normal course of business and are priced on an arms-length basis and settled on normal trade terms.

Minority interests 10 10 Total equity 2,665 691 223 46 3,087 Notes to the reconciliation of equity In addition to the accounting adjustments described below, the Group reclassified the following items: Current non-current assets and liabilities IFRS requires that all assets and liabilities are presented on a current non-current basis: Short-term deposits under IFRS these are classified as cash and cash equivalents: Investment property in accordance with IFRS, all land and buildings that are owned but not in use within the Group are separately classified: BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 139 Notes to the group accounts continued 36 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Software IFRS requires that software costs are capitalised as intangible assets: Retirement benefit obligation under IFRS this is separately presented from trade and other payables: Long-term contract balances under IFRS the amounts recoverable under long-term contacts are presented on the balance sheet as a single amount: Taxation in accordance with IFRS, assets and liabilities for current tax and deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented separately: Share of results of equity accounted investments IFRS requires that the Groups share of operating profit, finance costs and taxation expense of equity accounted investments are presented as a single line in the income statement.
a Regional aircraft financing As previously reported, the Group has provided guarantees in respect of residual values and head lease and finance payments on certain regional aircraft sold.
These arrangements were transacted through Special Purpose Entities SPEs that were not considered to be quasi subsidiaries forming part of the consolidated Group under UK GAAP.
In addition, the Group entered into various lease arrangements that are treated as operating leases under UK GAAP.
A significant proportion of the net exposures arising from these arrangements is covered by a Financial Risk Insurance Programme FRIP, which provides insurance cover for potential shortfalls in contracted and expected income.
On transition to IFRS, IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 27 requires the consolidation of all subsidiaries and SPEs the Group controls at 1 January 2004.
Based on the IAS 27 definition of control, and after taking into account the facts and circumstances relevant at the transition date, the Group has determined that it controls these SPEs.
Accordingly, the gross assets and obligations of the SPEs are consolidated in the IFRS balance sheet as at 1 January 2004.
In addition, a number of the lease arrangements are reclassified from operating leases under UK GAAP to finance leases following their assessment against the lease classification criteria in IAS 17 Leases with resulting changes to assets and debt.
Additionally, the reclassification of certain operating leases as finance leases outlined above require the reclassification of amounts payable under operating leases included within trade and other payables due after more than one year to amounts payable under finance leases within net debt.
The post-FRIP aircraft provision under UK GAAP remains under IFRS.
The balance sheet adjustment replaces the UK GAAP recourse provision and Option Aircraft Bond with aircraft property, plant and equipment, an insurance receivable trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and external debt.
The adjustment to the income statement includes the recognition of additional lease income on the aircraft within revenue, depreciation on the aircraft within operating costs and an interest charge on the additional net debt offset by the reversal of the NPV adjustment disclosed under UK GAAP.
The impact from these changes is summarised as follows: At For the year ended 1 January 2004 31 December 2004 m m Income statement Revenue 44 Operating costs 40 EBITA 4 Financial income 10 Financial expense 3 Adjustment to profit before taxation 11 Related taxation effect 3 Adjustment to profit after taxation 8 Net assets Property, plant and equipment 389 301 Trade and other receivables 153 169 Cash and cash equivalents 77 Trade and other payables 220 56 Loans and overdrafts 943 680 Provisions 227 198 53 51 Related taxation effect 16 15 Adjustment to net assets 37 36 140 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 36 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued b Pensions Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for defined benefit pension schemes in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs SSAP 24.
The Group also reported the transitional disclosures required in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits FRS 17, including the adjustment from the figures reported under SSAP 24 which would be required if FRS 17 was adopted in the financial statements.
The methodology and assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities under FRS 17 are substantially consistent with the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 19.
An area of difference that impacts the adjustment from SSAP 24 to IAS19 relates to the valuation of pension fund assets.
Under FRS 17, equities are valued using mid-market prices at valuation date whereas IFRS requires the use of bid prices.
The Group has allocated an appropriate share of the IAS 19 pension deficit to the equity accounted investments using a consistent method of allocation.
The balance sheet adjustment replaces the existing SSAP 24 pension asset and related deferred tax with the Groups share of the IAS 19 pension liability in provisions and the Groups share of the IAS 19 deficit allocated to the equity accounted investments within fixed asset investments, and the related deferred tax assets.
The adjustment to intangible assets represents the impact of replacing the SSAP24 pension asset in the acquisition balance sheet of certain acquisitions made in 2004 with the IAS 19 liability and the related deferred tax.
The income statement adjustment reflects the difference between the existing SSAP 24 operating charge and the Groups IAS 19 pension charge and net pension financing credit.
The Groups share of the operating charge recorded by the equity accounted investments is shown as an adjustment to the share of equity accounted investments result.
The impact from these changes is summarised as follows: At For the year ended 1 January 2004 31 December 2004 m m Income statement Operating costs 11 Share of results of equity accounted investments 6 Financial income 542 Financial expense 521 Adjustment to profit before taxation 38 Related taxation effect 17 Adjustment to profit after taxation 21 Net assets Intangible assets 51 Investments in joint ventures and associates 154 260 Trade and other receivables 531 602 Retirement benefit obligation 2,314 3,031 2,999 3,842 Related taxation effect 896 1,132 Adjustment to net assets 2,103 2,710 c Business combinations Under UK GAAP, the difference between the consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
IFRS requires that intangible assets of an acquired business are separately recognised from goodwill if their fair value can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets include trademarks, order backlog, licences and patented technologies.
Intangible assets recognised are then amortised over their useful life.
Under the transition rules, the Group is not required to identify any acquired intangible assets for acquisitions prior to 2004.
As a result of acquisitions made in 2004, the Group has reclassified intangible assets of 153m out of goodwill arising on acquisition, with an associated amortisation charge of 7m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Under UK GAAP, the fair value of acquired inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Under IFRS, the fair value of acquired inventory is based on selling price less a reasonable allowance for the costs of completion and disposal.
As a result, an adjustment of 6m was made to the acquisition balance sheet.
As at 31 December 2004 the uplifted inventory had been traded through the income statement, resulting in a 6m decrease in profit before tax for the year.
Deferred tax liabilities have also been recognised in respect of these intangible assets with a corresponding increase in acquired goodwill.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 141 Notes to the group accounts continued 36 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued The impact from these changes is summarised as follows: For the year ended 31 December 2004 m Income statement Operating costs 6 Amortisation of intangible assets 7 Adjustment to profit before taxation 13 Related taxation effect 5 Adjustment to profit after taxation 8 Net assets Intangible assets 30 Trade and other payables 7 Provisions 1 36 Related taxation effect 48 Adjustment to net assets 12 d Intangible assets goodwill Under UK GAAP, the Groups policy was to capitalise goodwill in respect of businesses acquired and amortise it on a straight line basis over its estimated useful economic life, which had been assessed as 20 years for all recent acquisitions.
On transition to IFRS, IFRS 1 requires the Group to conduct an impairment review of the carrying value of capitalised goodwill at 1 January 2004 for potential impairments.
No further impairments above those made under UK GAAP were required at 1 January 2004.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, no amortisation of goodwill is charged in the Groups consolidated IFRS accounts from 1 January 2004.
Instead, annual reviews of the goodwill are performed to test for impairments.
The adjustment reverses the amortisation charged in the year under UK GAAP of 492m.
In addition, 35m of amortisation charged under UK GAAP relating to the Avionics business is treated as an additional impairment under IFRS.
As a result there is a net increase to net assets.
The impact from these changes is summarised as follows: At For the year ended 1 January 2004 31 December 2004 m m Income statement Operating costs 348 Share of results of equity accounted investments 109 Adjustment to profit before taxation 457 Related taxation effect Adjustment to profit after taxation 457 Net assets Goodwill 348 Investments in joint ventures and associates 109 457 Related taxation effect Adjustment to net assets 457 142 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 36 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued e Intangible assets development costs Under IAS 38 Intangible Assets IAS 38, the Group is required to recognise, capitalise and amortise intangible assets on the balance sheet providing they meet certain recognition criteria.
Intangible assets include company-funded development expenditure.
Most of the Groups expenditure on research and development is conducted under specific customer contracts.
The balance relates to company-funded research and development expenditure which under UK GAAP was expensed as incurred.
Of this balance, a significant proportion relates to research costs that will continue to be expensed as incurred.
IAS 38 requires company-funded development expenditure to be capitalised from the point it meets certain recognition criteria and amortised over the estimated life of the development product.
The adjustment capitalises certain research and development costs previously expensed under UK GAAP.
The impact from these changes is summarised as follows: At For the year ended 1 January 2004 31 December 2004 m m Income statement Operating costs 4 Share of results of equity accounted investments 13 Adjustment to profit before taxation 17 Related taxation effect 1 Adjustment to profit after taxation 16 Net assets Intangible assets 38 Investments in joint ventures and associates 116 424 Related taxation effect 1 2 Adjustment to net assets 322 f Share-based payments Under UK GAAP, the cost of share options was based on the intrinsic value in the option at the date of grant, meaning that options granted to employees at market price do not generate an expense.
Options granted under Save-As-You-Earn schemes are at a 20% discount to market price on the date of the grant and are exempt from UK GAAP accounting.
Under IFRS 2 Share-based Payments, the Group measures the cost of all share options granted since November 2002 using fair value models.
As a result, additional expense is recognised in the IFRS income statement.
The adjustment increases the operating charge of the Groups share option schemes, with a portion of the increase being reflected in an increased balance sheet liability in respect of cash-settled share option schemes operated in the Groups US business.
The impact from these changes is summarised as follows: At For the year ended 1 January 2004 31 December 2004 m m Income statement Operating costs 18 Adjustment to profit before taxation 18 Related taxation effect 9 Adjustment to profit after taxation 9 Net assets Provisions 4 14 4 14 Related taxation effect 16 Adjustment to net assets 3 8 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 143 Notes to the group accounts continued 36 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued g Long-term contracts The Group accounted for long-term contracts under UK GAAP in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 9 Stocks and Long-term Contracts.
Under IFRS, long-term contracts are accounted for under either IAS 11 Construction Contracts or IAS 18 Revenue depending on the characteristics of the contract and its deliverables.
These standards provide more guidance on the determination of the timing and amount of revenue recognition.
The impact from these changes is summarised as follows: At For the year ended 1 January 2004 31 December 2004 m m Income statement Combined sales of Group and equity accounted investments 29 Less: adjustment for share of equity accounted investments 14 Operating costs 41 Adjustment to profit before taxation 2 Related taxation effect 1 Adjustment to profit after taxation 1 Net assets Trade and other receivables 33 31 Trade and other payables 22 18 11 13 Related taxation effect 4 5 Adjustment to net assets 78 h Revaluation of land and buildings It had been the Groups policy under UK GAAP to revalue its land and buildings until Financial Reporting Standard 15 Tangible Fixed Assets was adopted in 2000.
At that point the Group elected that no further revaluation of land and buildings would be undertaken.
The Group will not be adopting the exemption under the transition rules of IFRS 1 that allows the previous GAAP valuation to be used as the deemed cost on transition to IFRS.
Accordingly, the Group has reversed the previously recognised revaluations and has reverted to the use of historical cost for land and buildings.
The balance sheet adjustment reverses the existing UK GAAP revaluation reserve against the underlying fixed assets.
The income statement adjustment reflects the reduction in the depreciation charge.
The impact from this change is summarised as follows: At For the year ended 1 January 2004 31 December 2004 m m Income statement Operating costs 11 Adjustment to profit before taxation 11 Related taxation effect 3 Adjustment to profit after taxation 8 Net assets Property, plant and equipment 147 136 147 136 Related taxation effect 19 16 Adjustment to net assets 128 120 144 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 36 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued i Proposed dividends Under Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 17 Post Balance Sheet Events, proposed dividends are accrued for as an adjusting post balance sheet event in the accounting period to which they relate.
Under IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends are recognised in the accounting period in which they are declared.
Accordingly, the Group has reversed the accrual for its proposed dividends.
j Taxation Under IAS 12 Income Taxes, certain temporary timing differences, principally in respect of capital losses and rollover relief, that previously were not recognised under UK GAAP, have been recognised.
In addition, under IFRS deferred tax liabilities are created on a periodic basis where goodwill is tax deductible.
The impact from these changes is summarised as follows: At For the year ended 1 January 2004 31 December 2004 m m Income statement Taxation expense 25 Adjustment to profit after taxation 25 Net assets Deferred tax assets 107 80 Adjustment to net assets 107 80 Explanation of material adjustments to the cash flow statement for 2004 Short-term deposits that were classified as liquid resources under UK GAAP are reclassified as cash and cash equivalents under IFRS.
There are no other material differences between the cash flow statement presented under IFRS and the cash flow statement presented under UK GAAP.
