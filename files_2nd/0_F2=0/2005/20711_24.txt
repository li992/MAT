statutory comparatives do not follow either IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation or IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Consequently the statutory income statements for 2004 and 2005 are not on a comparable basis.
To enable a more meaningful presentation of results, in addition to the statutory comparatives, proforma results for 2004 have been prepared.
These show how the Deloitte & Touche LLP 2004 results would have looked, assuming the full application of IAS 32, and the application of IAS 39 excluding fair value accounting volatility.
We have not shown the full impacts from all the IAS 39 accounting rules, as hedges and financial assets to be fair valued were only designated and documented from 1 January 2005.
