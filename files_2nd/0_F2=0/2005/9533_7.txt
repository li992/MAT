The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 15 November 2005 and were signed on its behalf by: Sir John Craven Chairman J N Robinson Chief Financial Officer 37 Notes to the accounts 1 Statement on accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified for the revaluation of certain assets, and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
The Groups earnings stream is primarily US dollars and the functional currency is the US dollar.
The reporting currency is also the US dollar.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
The accounts have been prepared on the same basis and using the same accounting policies as those used to prepare the financial statements of the Lonmin Group for the year ended 30 September 2004.
Turnover Turnover represents sales of goods and services outside the Group net of discounts and allowances and value added tax and includes commissions earned.
Turnover is recorded when the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the purchaser.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consist of the results for the year ended 30 September 2005 and the assets and liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries as at that date.
The results of subsidiaries are included from the date of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries sold are included up to the date of sale.
Intangible fixed assets Goodwill On the acquisition of a company or business, fair values reflecting conditions at the date of acquisition are attributed to the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Where the fair value of the purchase consideration differs from the aggregate of these fair values, purchased goodwill arises.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 October 1998 is capitalised and amortised over its useful life in accordance with FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets.
Prior to 1 October 1998, goodwill was charged to reserves in the year of acquisition as a matter of accounting policy and, in accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS 10, goodwill has not been reinstated on implementation of FRS 10.
Goodwill arising during the year is being amortised over 20 years.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a previously acquired company or business, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging or crediting the amount of any related goodwill previously charged to reserves or capitalised and not yet charged to the profit and loss account.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and also at the end of the first complete financial year following an acquisition in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill.
Other intangible fixed assets Other intangible fixed assets are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their useful life in accordance with FRS 10.
The intangible asset acquired during the year is being amortised over 20 years.
Associates Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity accounting method.
An associate is a company, other than a subsidiary, in which the Groups interest is considered to be long-term and is substantial and over which the Group exercises a significant influence.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the Groups share of the results of associates.
The carrying value of associates in the Groups balance sheet comprises the Groups share of the net assets of associates.
Any goodwill arising on acquisition of associates is included within investments in associates and is written off over its useful economic life.
Joint arrangements The Group has certain contractual arrangements with other participants to engage in joint activities that do not create an entity carrying on a trade or business of its own.
The Group includes its share of the assets, liabilities and cash flows in such joint arrangements, measured in accordance with the terms of each arrangement, which is usually pro-rata to the Groups interest in the joint arrangement.
Lonmin Plc Annual Report 2005 38 www.
com 1 Statement on accounting policies continued Other investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provisions for impairments or at directors valuations.
Foreign currencies Subsidiaries that keep their accounts in currencies other than their functional currency remeasure them into the functional currency by the temporal method prior to consolidation.
This results in non-monetary assets and liabilities being recorded at their historical cost expressed in the functional currency whilst monetary assets and liabilities are stated at the closing exchange rate.
Differences on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
The principal US dollar exchange rates used in the financial statements, expressed as the foreign currency value of one US dollar, are as follows: 2005 2004 Average exchange rates: Sterling 0.54 0.56 South African Rand 6.28 6.60 Closing exchange rates: Sterling 0.57 0.55 South African Rand 6.36 6.48 Exploration costs Exploration expenditure is analysed between its constituent parts and accounted for as follows: a Replacement exploration This is defined as expenditure necessary to delineate and quantify the reserves and resources required to replace those extracted in any one accounting period, and as such is an operating cost which is expensed as incurred.
b Expansion and new opportunities exploration Within or adjacent to a producing unit These costs are expensed until a probable reserve has been defined and confirmed by a Competent Person.
At that point further costs are capitalised and the asset amortised over the estimated life of mine.
Greenfields or Brownfields These costs are expensed until an indicated resource has been defined and confirmed by a Competent Person.
At that point further costs are capitalised.
Amortisation commences in the first year of production after which amortisation is provided over the estimated life of the project.
Research and development Research and development costs, separate to exploration expenditure, are accounted for in accordance with SSAP 13 Accounting for research and development, and expenditure is written off in the period in which it arises.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recorded at cost or valuation, which are not updated under the transitional arrangements of FRS 15 Tangible fixed assets, less depreciation.
Depreciation on fixed assets is provided on a straight line or units of production basis, as appropriate.
Assets are depreciated over their estimated useful economic lives, or over the remaining life of the mine, if shorter, to residual value.
The life of a mine is based on proven and probable reserves.
Depreciation rates for the principal assets of the Group are as follows: Method Rate Shafts and underground Units of production 2.5%5.0% per annum 2040 years Metallurgical Straight line 2.5%7.1% per annum 1440 years Infrastructure Straight line 2.5%2.9% per annum 3540 years Mineral rights Units of production 2.5%2.9% per annum 3540 years Other plant and equipment Straight line 2.5%50% per annum 240 years 39 Notes to the accounts 1 Statement on accounting policies continued No depreciation is provided on surface mining land which has a continuing value and capital work in progress.
Tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant income generating unit or disposal value if higher in accordance with FRS 11.
Leases Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are shown in borrowings.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Capitalised interest Tangible fixed assets include directly attributable finance costs which are capitalised gross of tax during the period of construction.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost which includes the applicable proportion of production overheads and net realisable value.
PGMs stock is valued by allocating costs to Platinum, Palladium and Rhodium stock based on the annual cost of production, less revenue from by products, apportioned according to the quantities of each of the three main metals produced.
An improvement in underlying metallurgical recoveries led to an increase in the 2004 year-end closing stock valuation of $29 million.
During the second half of the year, the method of measuring stockpiles and concentrate was refined to value them based on metal content rather than tonnage: this had the effect of reducing the 2005 year-end closing stock by $22 million.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided for on timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date on a non-discounted basis.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes in accordance with local regulations.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group and are administered by trustees.
Independent actuaries prepare valuations of these schemes at least every three years and in accordance with their recommendations the Group makes contributions which are charged to profits on a systematic basis over the expected remaining working lives of the employees.
Any differences between the actuarial valuation of the obligation and the value of assets in a scheme are similarly charged or credited to profit before taxation over the expected remaining working lives of employees in the scheme.
The cost of defined contribution schemes is charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Certain Group companies provided post-retirement medical benefits to qualifying pensioners.
The expected costs of these benefits were charged to the profit and loss account over the expected remaining service lives of the relevant employees and were assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
During 2004 annuities were purchased to fulfil the outstanding obligations for postretirement medical benefits and the resulting liabilities were discharged.
Under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement benefits, additional disclosures are included for pension and other retirement benefits as disclosed in note 27 to the accounts.
Rehabilitation costs Group companies are generally required to restore mine and processing sites at the end of their producing lives to a condition acceptable to the relevant authorities.
Such costs are provided for in accordance with FRS 12 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets, so that rehabilitation costs are provided in full based on the best estimates of the future costs to be incurred, calculated on a discounted basis.
As the provision is recognised, it is either capitalised as part of the cost of the related mine or written off to the profit and loss account.
Where costs are capitalised the impact of such costs on the profit and loss account is spread over the life of the mine through the accretion of the discount of the provision and the depreciation over a units of production basis of the increased costs of the mining assets.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Examples of where such estimates are made include the valuation of pension schemes assets and liabilities where discount, Lonmin Plc Annual Report 2005 40 www.
com 1 Statement on accounting policies continued inflation and return rate assumptions are made, in the calculation of rehabilitation liabilities which involves projecting expected liabilities forward to the end lives of the mines using an assumed inflation rate and discounting these liabilities back to the present day using an assumed discount rate and the estimation of the metal content of stock.
Dividend reinvestment programme Under the Companys Dividend Reinvestment Plan, shareholders can elect for the whole of their cash dividends to be reinvested in Lonmin Plc shares which are purchased on their behalf in the market.
All cash dividends are paid to the Registrars who use the dividends of participants in the plan to fund these purchases.
Accordingly, no new shares are issued, dividends are paid and accounted for in the normal way, and there are no special accounting requirements for the programme.
