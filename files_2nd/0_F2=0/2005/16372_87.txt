At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 1 205 million and tax credits amounting to 327 million available for offset against future taxable profits.
Deferred tax assets totalling 655 million have not been recognised in respect of these losses and credits, as the likelihood of future economic benefit is not considered probable.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 765 million 2004: 503 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the forseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same scal authority.
