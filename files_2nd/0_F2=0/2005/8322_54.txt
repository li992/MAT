Accordingly the financial instruments disclosure presented in this note on the basis of IAS 32 and IAS 39 is only for 2005.
The UK GAAP FRS 13 disclosures for 2004 are shown in note 33. a Treasury policy Treasury policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are available for the development of the Groups business whilst managing its currency, interest rate and counterparty credit risks.
The Groups treasury policy is not to engage in speculative transactions.
Group treasury acts within clearly defined guidelines that are approved by the Board.
b Risk identification and management There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the key risks faced by the Group.
Activities are co-ordinated by the Risk Committee, which is chaired by the CFO, and has responsibility, on behalf of the Board, for ensuring the adequacy of systems for identifying and assessing significant risks, that appropriate control systems and other mitigating actions are in place, and that residual exposures are consistent with the Groups strategy and objectives.
Assessments are conducted for all material entities.
c Interest rate risk and hedge accounting The Group's policy is to fix interest rates for a significant portion of the debt, 61% as at 31 December 2005 using forward rate or interest rate swap agreements.
Significant interest rate management programmes and instruments require the specific approval of the Board.
The weighted average interest rate of fixed rate debt was 7%.
Where project finance is utilised, our policy is to align the maturity of the debt with the contractual terms of the customer offtake agreement.
The Group accounts for interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges where the forecast transaction is highly probable and the hedge is assessed as effective.
