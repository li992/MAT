Avis Europe plc 45 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 1 Revenue The activity of the Group is the supply of vehicle rental services and revenue is derived entirely from continuing activities.
The Group experiences a natural increase in demand from leisure customers over the European summer holiday months.
This seasonality generally results in lower revenue earned in the first half as compared to the second half of each year, together with an increase in the number of vehicles acquired in the period leading up to the summer months.
2 Business and geographical segments The dominant source and nature of the Groups risks and returns govern whether its primary segment reporting is by business segment or geographical segment.
The Group is subject to significant variations in risks and rewards between undertaking its operations through corporately owned businesses, as compared with the licensing of such operations to third parties.
Given the nature of the separate brands, the Group is also subject to significant variations in risks and rewards between its Avis branded businesses and its Budget branded businesses.
These variations contrast with more limited differentials between the risk and reward prole of operations in different geographical locations.
The Groups primary reporting format is therefore by business segment, and its secondary reporting format is geographical.
Segment assets include software, vehicles, other property, plant and equipment, stocks, debtors and operating cash, goodwill, corporation tax, deferred tax and investments.
Segment liabilities include operating liabilities, taxation and certain corporate borrowings.
Capital expenditure comprises additions to software, vehicles excluding vehicles under manufacturer re-purchase arrangements, other property, plant and equipment, including additions arising from business combinations, excluding goodwill arising on these acquisitions.

Underlying operating profit of Centrus in both years was nil.
No adjustment is made between segments to recharge the value of the overall Avis Budget goodwill, brand or licence rights.
Avis goodwill of 1,080.4 million arising before 1 March 1998 was fully written off to reserves, and Budget goodwill of 33.9 million arising on 12 March 2003 has been fully impaired and charged to the income statement in previous periods.
Had the value of goodwill, brand or licence rights been charged to the segments, the individual segment results would be materially affected.
No adjustment is made between segments to allocate the value of goodwill written off to reserves in previous periods see above.

A further 6.4 million was incurred in relation to a restructuring project the Group commenced in late 2005 covering the roles of its European headquarters, corporate operations, shared service centre and call centres see Note 44 for further information.
Restructuring costs of 9.6 million were incurred in the prior year.
b Following the Groups decision in 2004 to terminate the agreement with the principal contractor on the IT back-ofce project, additional termination costs of 3.6 million 2004: 43.4 million have been recognised in 2005, primarily arising from the mitigating action being taken against the termination costs, which may lead to a net credit in future accounting periods.
c During the year, the collection of credit hire receivable balances in the Centrus business was more successful than previously anticipated.
Exceptional income of 3.2 million 2004: 16.7 million has been recognised reecting a partial reversal of the receivable write-offs and reorganisation provisions made in previous years.
d Various professional, legal and consultancy costs have been incurred in the year in conjunction with the Companys capital restructuring see Note 30 and the rights issue see Note 29.
Where such costs are not directly attributable to the issue of new shares, or the drawing down of new debt facilities, they have been recognised in the income statement as exceptional items.
e In the prior year, the Group recognised an exceptional impairment provision against the goodwill in respect of the Budget business and goodwill arising on the acquisition of certain French licensee companies see Note 10.

Re-measurement losses on debt-related financial instruments of 1.2 million, comprises realised gains of 1.6 million, and unrealised losses of 2.8 million.
3 The Group has entered into economic hedging arrangements for which the Group is unable to apply hedge accounting under IAS 39.
Interest payable on bank loans and overdrafts, to the extent that IAS 39 does not permit hedge accounting, reects actual interest rates applicable to debt, regardless of any accrued cash ow paid at contracted rates within hedging derivatives.
4 The amendments in IAS 21 revised recently approved by the IASB has not been applied pending endorsement by the European Commission.
Had the revisions to IAS 21 been applied, most of the foreign exchange gain on net debt would have been recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense as part of net investment hedge amounts, rather than in the income statement.

The prior year weighted average number of shares has been restated to take account of the impact of the rights issue as detailed in Note 29.
Options have been granted to certain Directors and employees over ordinary shares of the Company see Note 31.
These options constitute the only category of potentially dilutive ordinary shares and these did not increase the weighted average number of shares in either 2004 or 2005 as the option exercise prices were in excess of the prevailing market share price.
Since these options were not dilutive they had no impact upon the income statement in either year.

In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, the Group completed a review of the carrying value of goodwill as at each year end.
The impairment review was to ensure that the carrying value of the Groups assets are stated at no more than their recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Goodwill was allocated to cash-generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing, each of these CGUs representing the Groups investment in each country where the goodwill originally arose.
After a reassessment of the long-term business plan for Budget, following the completion of the integration of the business acquired in March 2003, and in particular a downturn of the profitability of the Budget operations in France, the Directors concluded at 31 December 2004 that the recoverable amount determined by reference to their value in use of these businesses was less than the carrying amount of the associated assets.
As a consequence, impairment provisions of 32.4 million against the goodwill relating to the Budget business and 5.7 million against the goodwill relating to certain acquired French licensee companies, was recognised to write down the value of these assets to their recoverable amounts, representing a full provision against goodwill.
There were no cash ow impacts arising from these impairment provisions.
In the year to 31 December 2005, goodwill arose upon the acquisition of Budget licensee locations in France, and Avis licensee locations in France and Holland see Note 36.
As the acquired locations have been integrated into existing operations, where the goodwill arising in these cash-generating units had already been fully provided in previous accounting periods, impairment provisions have been recognised against the goodwill arising in the year.
Impairment provisions have therefore been recognised in the year against the Budget licensee acquisition, and the Avis licensee acquisitions of 0.4 million and 0.1 million respectively see Note 2.
The Directors also reviewed at each year end the carrying values of the remaining capitalised goodwill relating to the business in Greece and the joint venture in China see Note 14.
These reviews undertaken by calculating value in use did not result in the need for any impairment provision to be recognised as at 31 December 2004 or 31 December 2005.
In determining the value in use, the Directors calculated the present value of the estimated future cash ows expected to arise from the continuing use of the assets using pre-tax discount rates in the range from 7% to 11%.
The discount rate applied is based upon the Groups weighted average cost of capital with appropriate adjustment for the relevant risks associated with the businesses.
Estimated future cash ows are based on managements five-year plans for each cash-generating unit, with extrapolation thereafter based on the long-term average growth rates for the individual countries in which the individual cash-generating unit primarily operates.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
At the year end, the Group had unused tax losses of 123.4 million 2004: 134.4 million available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 43.8 million 2004: 25.4 million of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 79.6 million 2004: 109.0 million due to the unpredictability of future profit streams, but these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
Deferred tax has not been recognised in respect of other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets of 6.5 million 2004: 3.1 million and deferred tax liabilities of 0.1 million 2004: 0.1 million due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
At the year end, the aggregate amount of other temporary differences associated with unremitted earnings of the Groups overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 212.9 million 2004: 192.2 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in the joint venture and associate are insignicant.

Vehicle related receivables include 163.3 million 2004: 197.8 million held under finance lease arrangements.
The Groups principal financial assets comprise available for sale and held for trading investments: derivative financial instrument assets: trade and other receivables: and cash and short-term deposits, which in aggregate represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at each year end.
The credit risk on cash and short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
With respect to vehicle related receivables, credit risk is concentrated with the main European vehicle manufacturers.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to non-vehicle related receivables are limited due to the diversity of the Groups customers.
Balance sheet amounts are stated net of provisions for doubtful debts, and accordingly, the maximum credit risk exposure is the carrying amount of the receivables in the balance sheet.
An allowance of 25.1 million 2004: 25.1 million has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts of trade and other receivables.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past experience.
Irrecoverable trade and other receivable expense of 4.6 million 2004: 6.3 million has been recognised in the income statement in the year.

Due to the timescales and uncertainties involved in such claims, provision is made based upon the prole of claims experience, allowing for potential claims for a number of years after policy inception.
Other trading provisions primarily comprise: a Reorganisation and employee termination provisions of 3.1 million 2004: 7.4 million that are expected to crystallise within the next few years.
The reduction in the provision in the year is primarily due to the running down of the Centrus business.
b Dilapidation and environmental provisions of 6.6 million 2004: 6.7 million to cover the costs of the remediation of certain properties held under operating leases.
The fair value of these provisions, which are primarily euro denominated and non-interest bearing, are not materially different to the book values, and the ultimate expenditure is expected to be coterminous with the underlying remaining lease periods see Note 39. c Other short-term provisions of 5.5 million 2004: 3.4 million, which primarily comprise provision against future redemption of benets under customer loyalty programmes and provision against legal claims that arise in the normal course of business, that are expected to crystallise in the next couple of years.
In the Directors opinion, after taking appropriate legal advice, the outcome of these legal claims will not give rise to any significant loss beyond the amounts provided at 31 December 2005.

Mortality assumptions vary by scheme.
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice from published statistics and experience in each territory.
The post-retirement longevity assumption in the principal funded scheme applied a life expectancy for a member aged 65 in 2005 of 18 years 2004: 17 years for males, and 21 years 2004: 20 years for females.

62 Avis Europe plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 26 Derivative financial instruments Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups financial risk management objective is to reduce the financial risks and exposures facing the business with respect to changes in interest and foreign exchange rates, and to ensure constant access to sufficient liquidity.
To achieve this the Group undertakes an active hedging policy, including the use of derivatives interest rate and foreign exchange swaps, options, forward rate agreements and caps and collars, which are entered into under policies approved and monitored by a sub-committee of the Board, chaired by the Group Finance Director.
These transactions are only undertaken to reduce exposures arising from underlying commercial transactions and at no time are transactions undertaken for speculative reasons.
Foreign currency risk The majority of the Groups business is transacted in euros, sterling and US dollars.
The principal commercial currency of the Group is the euro, although dividends are payable in sterling.
The Group seeks to manage currency exposure wherever possible.
In each country where the Group has a corporate operation, revenue generated and costs incurred are primarily denominated in the relevant local currency, so providing a natural currency hedge.
In addition, intra-group trading transactions are netted and settled centrally.
Any remaining material foreign currency transaction exposures are hedged as appropriate.
Revenue recognised from licensees is primarily earned and received in sterling.
With regard to translation exposures, the policy is to match the average assets of the Group to the equivalent average liabilities in each major currency and thus minimise any impact to the Group.
To the extent that this does not occur, both foreign currency borrowings and forward exchange contracts are used.
Long-term US dollar borrowings undertaken to benefit from the liquidity of the US dollar denominated capital markets are swapped into euros.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk primarily arises from the Groups borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at xed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group has an exposure to movements in interest rates, principally in euro and sterling.
To manage these risks, the Group is both nanced through a combination of xed and oating rate facilities and enters into various derivatives.
The Group has a policy to ensure that the proportion of xed rate debt to net debt dened for this purpose to include the net book value of eet under operating leases for the next three year ends will be maintained in the range of 45% to 65%, 35% to 60% and 25% to 55% respectively.
Liquidity risk The seasonal nature of the business necessitates higher eet levels in the summer months and hence proportionately higher debt requirements.
Consequently the Group ensures that it has a core level of long-term funding in place, with maturities spread over a wide range of dates, supplemented by shorter-term facilities to cover requirements through the year.
Credit risk The Group controls this risk from a treasury perspective by only entering into transactions involving financial instruments with authorised counter-parties of strong credit quality, and such positions are monitored regularly see Note 19.

As none of the derivative financial instruments are traded in an active market their fair values are determined using a number of methods and assumptions that are based on conditions at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of future estimated cash ows.
The fair value of interest rate caps and collars are valued using option valuation techniques.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The book values of derivative financial instruments as recognised in the 2004 comparatives, and their related fair values, are as follows: 2004 Book amount Fair value m m Derivative financial instruments included in debt Interest rate swaps, caps and collars 4.6 Cross currency interest rate swaps 77.8 96.6 Forward foreign currency contracts and foreign exchange options 0.8 2.0 78.6 99.2 Amounts included in accrued interest in respect of derivative financial instruments Interest rate swaps, caps and collars 0.6 Cross currency interest rate swaps 2.3 Forward foreign currency contracts and foreign exchange options 0.3 3.2 75.4 99.2 64 Avis Europe plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 26 Derivative financial instruments continued Hedging instruments Forward foreign exchange contracts Forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2005 with notional values of US$11.6 million 2004: US$16.8 million and South African Rand 2.5 million 2004: South African Rand nil were used to hedge expected foreign currency income as follows: US$2.2 million 2004: US$2.5 million and South African Rand 2.5 million 2004: South African Rand nil into sterling, and US$9.4 million 2004: US$14.3 million into euro.
These forward exchange contracts and corresponding foreign currency receipts will mature within 12 months of each year end.
Movements in the fair value of these forward foreign exchange contracts were recognised as cash ow hedges in the hedging reserve within equity.
These amounts are then transferred to the income statement when the forecast amounts are received at various dates between one and 12 months after the year end.
Cross currency interest rate swaps Cross currency interest rate swaps of aggregate notional principal amounts of US$390.0 million 2004: US$447.5 million were used to hedge the Groups US$ denominated loan notes see Note 25.
Fair value hedges of 22.3 million 2004: nil arise from the hedging of the principal value of the exposures to euro denominated liabilities.
Cash ow hedges arise from the conversion of the regular semi-annual US$ denominated interest payments to euro denominated interest payments.
Amounts recognised within equity will be released to the income statement when the underlying xed interest payments occur at various dates between the year end and 2014.
Non-hedging instruments Forward foreign exchange contracts Forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2005 were held to convert the following foreign currency notional amounts into sterling balances totalling 65.2 million 2004: 100.7 million : Swiss Francs 57.7 million 2004: Swiss Francs 59.5 million : Singapore dollar 2.3 million 2004: Singapore dollar 3.3 million : US$3.2 million 2004: US$2.6 million : and South African Rand 6.0 million 2004: South African Rand 5.2 million.
In addition, at 31 December 2004, the Group held forward exchange contracts to convert South African Rand 12.4 million into euro balances of 1.4 million.
Forward foreign exchange options Forward foreign exchange option contracts as at 31 December were held to convert expected foreign currency income of: US$1.3 million 2004: US$2.5 million into sterling of 0.7 million 2004: 1.4 million : US$5.7 million 2004: US$8.5 million into 4.5 million 2004: 6.9 million.
These option contracts and corresponding foreign currency receipts will mature within 12 months of each year end.
Interest rate swaps The notional principal amount of outstanding interest rate swap contracts as at the year end was 165.0 million 2004: 260.0 million, with xed interest rates payable between 4.1% and 5.9%.
The notional principal amounts of outstanding interest rate caps and collars as at the year end was 70.0 million 2004: 70.0 million.
In addition, forward start interest rate swaps have aggregate notional principals of 50.0 million 2004: 50 million which commence in 2006 and will run for four years.
The swaps will convert the prevailing oating interest rate to an average xed rate of 5.2%.

The fair value of obligations under finance leases approximates to their book value as the majority of these obligations are due within one year see Note 24.
The fair value of borrowings and deferred consideration for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash ows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.

To enable the rights issue, the shareholders approved, at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 4 July 2005, an increase in the Companys authorised share capital and authorised the Directors to allot the new shares.
The authorised share capital immediately following the Extraordinary General Meeting was 9,400,000 divided into 940,000,000 shares.
A total of 334,736,017 new shares were issued on 4 July 2005 pursuant to the rights issue.
The new shares rank equally in all respects with the existing shares, including the right to receive all dividends or distributions made, paid or declared.
Avis Europe plc 67 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 29 Called-up share capital continued The net proceeds of the rights issue were received on 27 July 2005 and 1 August 2005 and amounted to 111.1 million 166.2 million, which has been recognised as follows: Rights issue m m Share capital as above 3.3 5.0 Share premium see Note 30 4.8 7.4 Own shares see Note 30 0.1 0.2 Merger reserve see Note 32 112.7 168.8 Net proceeds 111.1 166.2 The net proceeds above exclude other professional, legal and consultancy costs which have been incurred in conjunction with the rights issue, but are not directly attributable to the issue of shares, that have been recognised in the income statement as exceptional items see Note 5.
The net proceeds have been used to pay down short-term uncommitted borrowings and to reduce the amounts drawn on the Groups revolving lines of credit.

The deficit on the retained earnings account in the unconsolidated balance sheet of the Company, and in the consolidated balance sheet of the Group, have been reduced accordingly.
Own shares are held by the Avis Europe Employee Share Trust, a discretionary trust, to partially satisfy options and awards granted under a number of the Groups share schemes.
At 31 December 2005, the Trust held 664,049 shares 2004: 581,095 shares, with a market value of 70 pence per share 2004: 54 pence per share, which have been recognised as a reduction in shareholders funds.
During the year the Trust acquired 241,472 shares as part of the rights issue, which represented 0.026% of the issued share capital post the rights issue.
None of the shares held at the year end are under option to employees, nor have they been conditionally gifted to them.
The Avis Europe Employee Share Trust has not waived its right to dividends on these shares.

During the year, pursuant to the rights issue see Note 29, and in accordance with the individual share option scheme rules, adjustments have been approved to increase the number of shares under option and decrease where relevant the exercise price per share of any options.
The purpose of these adjustments was to counter the depreciatory effect which the rights issue would otherwise have on the latent value of options.

All of the Equity Partnership Plan options and some of the options from the other schemes were issued before 7 November 2002 and therefore the fair values of these granted options are not recognised.
For options issued after 7 November 2002, the fair value of the option must be assessed on the date of each issue.
The Group uses a stochastic valuation model at each issue date re-assessing the input assumptions on each occasion.
No options have been issued in 2005 and accordingly the only movements in the year to impact on the weighted average relate to the rights issue and the forfeited and expired options.
The weighted average of the assumptions used in each valuation and the resulting weighted average fair value per option were as follows: Approved and Unapproved Share Schemes Performance Share Plan Share Retention Plan Weighted average 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 Share price pence 80.6 95.6 76.8 91.6 42.7 51.0 Option exercise price pence 80.6 95.6 Vesting period years 3.0 3.0 5.5 5.5 2.0 2.0 Option life years 10.0 10.0 7.0 7.0 2.0 2.0 Expected volatility % 49% 49% 49% 49% 49% 49% Risk free rate of return % 4.7% 4.7% 4.8% 4.8% 4.8% 4.8% Probability of ceasing employment before vesting % 5% 5% 0% 0% 0% 0% Expectations of meeting performance criteria % 43% 43% 55% 55% 100% 100% Fair value per option pence 29.1 35.0 44.1 52.7 42.7 51.0 Weighted average share price pence : weighted average option exercise price pence and weighted average fair value per option pence have been adjusted in 2005 but not 2004 comparatives for the changes in the number of options and exercise price arising from the rights issue in 2005 see above.
Expected volatility was determined by reference to the volatility in the share price using rolling one year periods for the five years immediately preceding the grant date.
The risk free rate of return is based upon UK gilt rates with an equivalent term to the options granted.
For options issued prior to July 2003, an expected dividend yield of 6.4% was applied, based on historic dividend yield performance.
For options issued after July 2003, future dividend assumptions were aligned to the dividend expectations publicly announced by the Group.

A foreign exchange gain of 1.0 million 2004: 0.9 million on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised as part of the exchange movements in the translation reserve.
The merger reserve was recognised as a consequence of the Company taking merger relief under s131 Companies Act 1985, on shares issued to acquire, as part of the rights issue process, an investment in the ordinary and redeemable preference shares in Caelum Limited a company incorporated in Jersey.
Following the subsequent redemption of the preference shares acquired, the related amount previously standing to the credit of the merger reserve has become realised and has been transferred to retained earnings.

Certain Group companies are defendants in a number of claims and legal proceedings incidental to their operations.
The Directors do not expect that any of these contingencies will have a material impact on the results or financial position of the Group.

44 Subsequent events In late 2005, the Group commenced a restructuring project covering the roles of its European headquarters, corporate operations and Shared Service Centres.
On 15 February 2006, having completed the planning stage, the Group announced the full extent of the project to create an organisation that is both more effective and more efficient.
The project comprises the following main elements: a substantial reduction in staff and running costs at the European headquarters: an acceleration of the transfer of back-ofce activities into the shared service centre in Budapest: consolidation of all call centre activities into the existing Barcelona facility and closure of the Manchester call centre: and a number of other people and overhead cost initiatives within corporate operations.
In addition to 6.4 million of exceptional costs taken in 2005 see Note 5, the exceptional costs of this project are expected to amount to some 40.0 million in 2006 and 7.0 million in 2007.
The project will generate anticipated savings of around 7.0 million in 2006, 25.0 million in 2007 and 30.0 million per annum thereafter.
Also subsequent to the year end, the Group has entered into a new five year revolving syndicated credit facility of 580 million, replacing the revolving syndicated facility of 385 million in place at 31 December 2005.
45 Explanation of the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards a Application of IFRS 1 The Groups Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 are the first annual financial statements that have been prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The Groups transition date is 1 January 2004.
The Group prepared its opening IFRS balance sheet as at that date.
The reporting date of these Consolidated Financial Statements is 31 December 2005.
The Groups IFRS adoption date is 1 January 2005.
In preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements, the Group has applied the mandatory exceptions and certain of the optional exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS.
Avis Europe plc 77 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 45 Explanation of the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards continued b Transition to IFRS First time adoption IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, provides the basis upon which companies are to initially convert their financial statements to IFRS.
IFRS 1 allows certain exemptions and options in respect of accounting and disclosure on transition to IFRS.
The Group has taken the following key exemptions: Business combinations The Group has applied the business combinations exemption in IFRS 1.
It has not restated business combinations that took place prior to the 1 January 2004 transition date.
Under IFRS 3, Business Combinations, the net book value of goodwill is frozen at 1 January 2004 and is no longer subject to amortisation.
Instead it is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis, or more frequently when there is an indication that the carrying value is not recoverable.
Cumulative translation differences The Group has elected to set all previous cumulative translation differences of its investments in subsidiaries, joint venture and associate to zero as at 1 January 2004.
Post-employment benefits The Group has elected to immediately recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses as at 1 January 2004.
Share-based transactions IFRS 2, Share-Based Payment, has only been applied to equity based employee compensation schemes in respect of awards granted after 7 November 2002, and not vested by 1 January 2005.
Financial instruments Under IFRS, certain of the Groups financial instruments are required to be measured at fair value, in accordance with IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosures and Presentation, and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Measurement and Recognition.
Derivatives, which are largely held off-balance sheet under UK GAAP, must be recognised in the balance sheet in full and at fair value.
Subject to satisfying the requirements for hedge accounting, any gains or losses in the period arising from the movement in the fair values of derivatives are recognised in the income statement.
In accordance with IFRS 1, the Group has opted to apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 with effect from 1 January 2005.
As permitted under IFRS 1, the comparative data for 2004 therefore excludes the impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39, and such derivatives have been accounted for instead on the basis of the Groups UK GAAP accounting policies.
The impact of the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on the balance sheet as at 1 January 2005 is separately detailed in Note 47 below.
46 Reconciliations between IFRS and UK GAAP The following reconciliations provide a quantication of the effect of the transition to IFRS on the Group.

As a result, certain balances which were previously disclosed in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are now separately disclosed on the face of the balance sheet or income statement.
Furthermore, relevant sub-headings have been amended to comply with the Groups ongoing IFRS reporting format.
The UK GAAP balances as at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2004 have also been restated from those disclosed within the Groups Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Restatement has been performed for the following items: a Accounting policy changes In accordance with FRS 18, Accounting Policies, UK GAAP accounting policies were previously selected on the basis of relevance, reliability, understandability and comparability.
Given the transition to IFRS and the consequent changes in comparability, management have revisited the Group accounting policies for both UK GAAP and IFRS purposes.
The balances as disclosed as at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2004 have been restated from those disclosed within the Groups Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 for the following items: 82 Avis Europe plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 46 Reconciliations between IFRS and UK GAAP continued Revenue recognition From 1 January 2005, for both UK GAAP and IFRS purposes, the Groups policy is to recognise income from both the sale of fuel and the provision of foreign exchange services to rental customers as included in revenue.
Prior to 1 January 2005, these services were viewed as cost recoveries, with the income arising thereon netted directly against the related costs of providing the services.
For the year ended 31 December 2004, additional revenue of 75.9 million is recognised, with an offsetting reduction in cost of sales of 61.8 million and administrative expenses of 14.1 million.
Inventory disclosure From 1 January 2005, for both UK GAAP and IFRS purposes, the Groups policy is to separately disclose fuel and garage stocks within inventory.
Prior to 1 January 2005, these balances were recognised within other receivables.
Fuel and garage stock balances as at 31 December 2003 of 5.4 million and 31 December 2004 of 6.2 million have been separately disclosed accordingly.
Interest capitalisation Prior to 1 January 2005, for UK GAAP purposes, the Groups policy was to capitalise finance costs on major capital projects, where such costs were directly attributable to that project.
From 1 January 2005, for both UK GAAP and IFRS purposes, the Groups policy is to recognise all such finance costs as and when incurred.
Capitalised interest balances within other tangible xed assets as at 31 December 2003 of 0.2 million and 31 December 2004 of 0.1 million have been expensed from the UK GAAP restated balance sheet.
In addition, the income statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 have been restated.
b Vehicle manufacturer re-purchase agreements Vehicles used by the Group under certain manufacturer re-purchase agreements which are accounted for as tangible xed assets under UK GAAP are treated as operating leases for IFRS purposes.
As explained below, this difference in accounting treatment has a significant impact on the format of the Groups income statement and balance sheet, but has no impact on the Groups net assets or net result for a period.
The depreciation charge recognised in respect of these vehicles under UK GAAP and the gain on disposal of these vehicles are reclassied as a net operating lease charge under IFRS.
The relevant xed asset balances under UK GAAP are reclassied as prepaid operating lease balances together with receivable balances due under the re-purchase agreement as follows: Year ended 31 December 2004 Income statement m Recognised under UK GAAP Depreciation 182.0 Gain on disposal of xed assets 1.8 180.2 Recognised under IFRS GAAP Operating lease charges net of unwinding of discount on vehicle re-purchase contracts 180.2 31 December 31 December 2003 2004 Balance sheet m m Recognised under UK GAAP Net book value of vehicles 846.9 874.3 Recognised under IFRS GAAP Vehicle re-purchase agreement receivables 796.6 795.0 Prepaid operating lease debtors 50.3 79.3 Trade and other receivables 846.9 874.3 Avis Europe plc 83 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 46 Reconciliations between IFRS and UK GAAP continued Year ended 31 December 2004 Cash flow statement m Recognised under UK GAAP Investing activities: Purchase of vehicles 1,184.6 Proceeds on disposal of vehicles 1,804.2 Financing activities: Repayment of finance lease obligations 700.9 Total cash ows relating to vehicles subject to manufacturer re-purchase contracts 81.3 Recognised under IFRS GAAP Operating activities: Payments with respect to manufacturer re-purchase contracts 1,308.7 Receipts with respect to manufacturer re-purchase contracts 1,244.5 Cash generated from operations 64.2 Financing activities: Net finance lease cash ows on vehicles subject to manufacturer re-purchase contracts 17.1 Total cash ows relating to vehicles subject to manufacturer re-purchase contracts 81.3 c Post-employment benefits The Group has various dened benefit post-employment plans.
Under UK GAAP, independent qualied actuaries value these dened benefit schemes on a regular basis, generally every three years, using the projected unit cost method.
Surpluses and deficits arising from the valuations were spread over the average remaining service lives of employees, with any difference between the profit and loss account charge and the contributions paid included as an asset or liability in the balance sheet where applicable.
Under IFRS, dened benefit retirement plans are valued using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benets have already vested, and is otherwise amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benets become realised.
Upon transition, the Group has adopted the amendment to IAS 19, Employee Benets, whereby actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Therefore, upon transition the actuarial positions as previously disclosed under FRS 17, Retirement Benets, are largely required to be fully recognised under IFRS.
Certain other post-employment benets outside of the scope of FRS 17 are also subject to actuarial valuation and are accounted for in a similar way.
Additional pension deficits are therefore recognised as follows: Year ended 31 December 2004 Income statement m Recognised under UK GAAP Other pension costs 13.1 Recognised under IFRS GAAP Other pension costs 15.4 31 December 31 December 2003 2004 Balance sheet m m Recognised under UK GAAP Pension prepayments 0.2 0.5 Pension provision 24.4 24.6 Recognised under IFRS GAAP Pension prepayments Pension provision 77.6 86.6 84 Avis Europe plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 46 Reconciliations between IFRS and UK GAAP continued d Goodwill and intangible assets In accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations, as from 1 January 2004 goodwill balances are not amortised, but are instead annually tested for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired.
For UK GAAP purposes, goodwill had been tested for impairment as at 1 January 2004 in accordance with the requirements of accounting standard FRS 11, Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill.
Goodwill was allocated to cash-generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing, each of these CGUs representing the Groups investment in each country of operation where the goodwill originally arose.
Impairment provisions totalling 45.6 million 32.1 million were recognised at this time against the Groups investment in AutoHof Bismark GMBH, Avis Autoverhuur BV and Centrus Limited.
For IFRS purposes, no additional impairment to that already recognised by the Group as at 31 December 2003 under UK GAAP was identied as at 31 December 2003.
The Group also undertook a further review of the carrying value of the Groups goodwill balances as at 31 December 2004.
For UK GAAP purposes impairment provisions of 36.1 million were recognised as at 31 December 2004 to write down the value of goodwill relating to Budget and certain French licensees.
The Directors have also reviewed the carrying values of the goodwill in the business in Greece and the Groups joint venture in China for both UK GAAP and IFRS purposes as at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2004.
None of these reviews resulted in the need for further impairment provisions to be recognised under either UK GAAP or IFRS.
Further to the above, for IFRS purposes, all goodwill amortisation recognised under UK GAAP in the year ended 31 December 2004 is reversed.
Where this goodwill amortisation related to goodwill balances against which a full impairment provision was recognised for UK GAAP purposes as at 31 December 2004, an off-setting impairment charge is recognised under IFRS.
Where there was no impairment under UK GAAP, no additional impairment was considered necessary under IFRS.
Recognised balances under UK GAAP and IFRS are therefore as follows: Year ended 31 December 2004 Income statement m Recognised under UK GAAP Goodwill amortisation 2.6 Exceptional impairment charge 36.1 38.7 Recognised under IFRS GAAP Goodwill amortisation Exceptional impairment charge 38.1 38.1 31 December 31 December 2003 2004 Balance sheet m m Recognised under UK GAAP Goodwill 45.4 7.2 Recognised under IFRS GAAP Goodwill 45.4 7.8 e Foreign exchange IFRS requires an individual entity to measure its transactions in the functional currency that best reects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances relevant to that entity.
In accordance with IFRS guidance the functional currencies of certain Group entities have been changed from sterling to euro.
Following this change, resulting foreign exchange gains losses on sterling debt balances within the affected entities are required to be recognised in the income statement, rather than being recognised in reserves.
f Taxation IAS 12, Income Taxes, requires full provision for all taxable temporary differences.
A temporary difference arises where there is a difference between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax value.
A temporary difference is taxable if it will result in taxable amounts in the future, when the carrying amount of the asset is recovered or the liability is settled.
The main effect of IAS 12 is the recognition of the deferred taxation impacts of the other adjusting items arising on transition to IFRS.
In particular, the deferred taxation impacts arising from the recognition of the dened benefit scheme obligations.
Income taxes paid during 2004 are classied as operating cash ows under IFRS but were included in a separate category of cash ows under UK GAAP.
Avis Europe plc 85 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 46 Reconciliations between IFRS and UK GAAP continued g Other impacts The following additional impacts result in changes in presentation and disclosures within the Consolidated Financial Statements: Share-based payments IFRS 2, Share-Based Payment, requires that share-based employee benets are expensed to the profit and loss account based on their fair value, instead of the intrinsic value required under UK GAAP.
A stochastic share option valuation model has been developed in conjunction with external actuarial advisers to calculate the appropriate fair values.
The fair values are calculated on the date of grant of the awards and the total fair value is charged to income over the relevant vesting periods, adjusted to reect expected levels of lapses and expected achievement of vesting conditions.
For IFRS purposes additional share-based payment costs are recognised in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 0.1 million.
Software For UK GAAP purposes, software that is related to a particular xed asset has been disclosed within plant and equipment.
For IFRS purposes software balances have been disclosed within other intangible xed assets totalling 14.7 million at 31 December 2003 and 2.6 million at 31 December 2004.
Non-current assets held for sale The Group has elected to retrospectively apply IFRS 5, Non-Current Assets Held For Sale and Discontinued Operations.
IFRS 5 requires that any non-current assets held for resale are separately disclosed.
The Group has reclassied from xed assets individual ex-rental eet vehicles for which management are demonstrably committed to disposal.
This amounts to 2.1 million at 31 December 2003 and 5.0 million at 31 December 2004.
Dividends For UK GAAP purposes, the Group recognised proposed ordinary dividends payable at the point where the Directors declare the dividend.
In accordance with IAS 10, Events After The Balance Sheet Date, such dividends are only recognised when authorised by the shareholders, or in the case of interim dividends, when they are paid.
Proposed ordinary dividends payable as at 31 December 2003 of 21.7 million have been reversed accordingly for IFRS purposes.
Cash and cash equivalents For UK GAAP purposes, cash and cash equivalents comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
For IFRS cash ow purposes, cash and cash equivalents also includes short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and which are subject to an insignicant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts.
Various short-term investment balances are therefore reclassied to cash and short-term deposits for IFRS purposes amounting to 16.0 million at 31 December 2003 and 18.0 million at 31 December 2004.
Bank overdrafts of 9.8 million at 31 December 2003 and 13.8 million at 31 December 2004 are also included within cash and cash equivalents in the cash ow statement.
Share of profit of joint ventures and associate The Groups share of operating profit, interest costs and taxation were disclosed separately as part of operating profit, net interest payable and taxation under UK GAAP.
For IFRS purposes the Groups share of net profit of joint ventures and associate is disclosed as part of profit before tax.
