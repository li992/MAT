41 Segmental analysis The directors manage the Group primarily by class of business and present the segmental analysis on that basis.
Segments charge market prices for services rendered to other parts of the Group with the exception of Manufacturing and central resources.
The expenditure incurred by Manufacturing relates to shared costs principally in respect of the Group's UK and Ireland banking and insurance operations.
These costs reflect activities that are shared between the various customer-facing divisions and consequently cannot be directly attributed to individual divisions.
Funding charges between segments are determined by Group Treasury, having regard to commercial demands.
