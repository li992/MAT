Deferred tax assets have only been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets because it is probable that these assets will be recovered.
A deferred tax asset of 30.1m 2004: 33.9m has not been recognised in respect of capital losses as the realisation of this deferred tax asset is not considered likely.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as it is not expected that the distribution of overseas earnings will give rise to a tax liability.
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of the country of operation.
The movement on the net deferred tax liability is shown below.
