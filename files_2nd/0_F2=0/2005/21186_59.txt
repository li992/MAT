38 Financial guarantees and options As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including investment return guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
a UK Life with-profits business In the UK, life insurers are required to comply with the FSAs realistic reporting regime for their with-profit funds for the calculation of FSA liabilities.
Under the FSAs rules, provision for guarantees and options within realistic liabilities must be measured at fair value, using market-consistent stochastic models.
A stochastic approach includes measuring the time value of guarantees and options, which represents the additional cost arising from uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions.
The material guarantees and options to which this provision relates are: i Maturity value guarantees Substantially all of the conventional with-profit business and a significant proportion of unitised with-profit business have minimum maturity values reecting the sums assured plus declared annual bonus.
In addition, the guarantee fund has offered maturity value guarantees on certain unit-linked products.
ii No market valuation reduction MVR guarantees For unitised business, there are a number of circumstances where a no MVR guarantee is applied, for example on certain policy anniversaries, guaranteeing that no market value reduction will be applied to reect the difference between the guaranteed value of the policy and the market value of the underlying assets.
iii Guaranteed annuity options The Groups UK with-profit funds have written individual and group pensions which contain guaranteed annuity rate options GAOs, where the policyholder has the option to take the benets from a policy in the form of an annuity based on guaranteed conversion rates.
The Group also has exposure to GAOs and similar options on deferred annuities.
iv Guaranteed minimum pension The Groups UK with-profit funds also have certain policies which contain a guaranteed minimum level of pensions as part of the condition of the original transfer from state benets to the policy.
In addition, while these do not constitute guarantees, the Group has made promises to certain policyholders, in relation to their mortgage endowments, that payments on these policies will meet the mortgage value, provided investment returns exceed 6% per annum net of tax between 1 January 2000 and maturity and the investment returns on the free reserves are sufficient to meet the top-up costs.
b UK Life non-profit business The Groups UK non-profit funds are not subject to the requirements of the FSAs realistic reporting regime and, therefore, liabilities are evaluated by reference to local statutory reserving rules.
i Guaranteed annuity options Similar options to those written in the with-profit fund have been written in relation to non-profit products.
Provision for these guarantees does not materially differ from a provision based on a market-consistent stochastic model, and amounts to 44 million at 31 December 2005 2004: 47 million.
ii Guaranteed unit price on certain products Certain unit-linked pension products linked to long-term life insurance funds provide policyholders with guaranteed benets at retirement or death.
No additional provision is made for this guarantee as the investment management strategy for these funds is designed to ensure that the guarantee can be met from the fund, mitigating the impact of large falls in investment values and interest rates.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 160 Financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 38 Financial guarantees and options continued c Overseas life businesses In addition to guarantees written within the Groups UK life businesses, our overseas businesses have also written contracts containing guarantees and options.
Details of the significant guarantees and options provided by overseas life businesses are set out below.
i France Guaranteed surrender value and guaranteed minimum bonuses Aviva France has written a number of contracts with such guarantees.
The guaranteed surrender value is the accumulated value of the contract including accrued bonuses.
Bonuses are based on accounting income from amortised bond portfolios, where the duration of bond portfolios is set in relation to the expected duration of the policies, plus income and releases from realised gains on equity-type investments.
Policy reserves are equal to guaranteed surrender values.
Local statutory accounting envisages the establishment of a reserve, Provision pour Alas Financiers PAF, when accounting income is less than 125% of guaranteed minimum credited returns.
A PAF of 16 million was established at the end of 2005.
The most significant of these contracts is the AFER Eurofund which has total liabilities of 22 billion at 31 December 2005 2004: 21 billion.
The guaranteed bonus on this contract equals 65% of the average of the last two years declared bonus rates or 60% of the TME index rates if higher and was 3.51% for 2005 2004: 3.69% compared with an accounting income from the fund of 4.91% 2004: 5.25%.
Non-AFER contracts with guaranteed surrender values had liabilities of 7 billion 2004: 6 billion at 31 December 2005 and guaranteed annual bonus rates are between 0% and 4.5% on 97.8% of liabilities.
There are higher guarantees in force on some older policies including a small number of policies with a guarantee of 8.5%.
For non-AFER business, the accounting income return exceeded guaranteed bonus rates in 2005.
Guaranteed death and maturity benets In France, the Group has also sold unit-linked policies where the death and or maturity benefit is guaranteed to be at least equal to the premiums paid.
The reserve held in the Groups consolidated balance sheet at the end of 2005 for this guarantee is 14 million 2004: 17 million.
The reserve is calculated on a prudent basis and is in excess of the economic liability.
At the end of 2005, total sums at risk for these contracts were 73 million 2004: 182 million out of total unit-linked funds of 8 billion 2004: 6 billion.
The average age of policyholders was approximately 53.
It is estimated that the economic liability would increase by 1 million 2004: 2 million if yields were to decrease by 1% per annum and by 0.1 million 2004: 1 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2005 levels.
These gures do not reect our ability to review the tariff for this option.
ii Netherlands Guaranteed minimum return at maturity In the Netherlands, it is market practice to guarantee a minimum return at maturity on traditional savings and pensions contracts.
Guarantees on older lines of business are 4% per annum while, for business written since 1 September 1999, the guarantee is 3% per annum.
On group pensions business, it is often possible to recapture guarantee costs through adjustments to surrender values or to premium rates.
On transition to IFRS, Delta Lloyd changed the reserving basis for most traditional contracts to reect current market interest rates, for consistency with the reporting of assets at market value.
The cost of meeting interest rate guarantees is allowed for directly in the liabilities.
The total liabilities for traditional business at 31 December 2005 are 8 billion 2004: 8 billion analysed as follows: Restated Restated Liabilities 3% guarantee Liabilities 3% guarantee Liabilities 4% guarantee Liabilities 4% guarantee 31 December 2005 31 December 2004 31 December 2005 31 December 2004 m m m m Individual 1,210 1,098 3,112 3,169 Group pensions 412 263 3,175 3,695 Total 1,622 1,361 6,287 6,864 Restated to reect the move to the active liability basis under IFRS.
Delta Lloyd has certain unit-linked contracts which provide a guaranteed minimum return at maturity from 4% pa to 2% pa.
Provisions consist of unit values plus an additional reserve for the guarantee.
The additional provision for the guarantee was 127 million 2004: 118 million.
An additional provision of 77 million 2004: 27 million in respect of investment return guarantees on group segregated fund business is held.
It is estimated that the provision would increase by 293 million 2004: 234 million if yields were to reduce by 1% pa and by 44 million 2004: 49 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2005 levels.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 161 38 Financial guarantees and options continued iii Ireland Guaranteed annuity options Products with similar GAOs to those offered in the UK have been issued in Ireland.
The current net of reinsurance provision for such options is 145 million 2004: 125 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis, making conservative assumptions for the factors which inuence the cost of the guarantee, principally annuitant mortality and long-term interest rates.
These GAOs are in the money at current interest rates but the exposure to interest rates under these contracts has been hedged through the use of reinsurance, using derivatives swaptions.
The swaptions effectively guarantee that an interest rate of 5% will be available at the vesting date of these benets so there is no exposure to a further decrease in interest rates.
No MVR guarantees Certain unitised with-profit policies containing no MVR guarantees, similar to those in the UK, have been sold in Ireland.
These guarantees are currently out-of-the-money by 84 million 2004: 79 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis as the excess of the current policy surrender value over the discounted value excluding terminal bonus of the guarantees.
The value of these guarantees is sensitive to the performance of investments held in the with-profit fund.
Amounts payable under these guarantees are determined by the bonuses declared on these policies.
It is estimated that the guarantees would be out-of-the-money by 74 million 2004: 80 million if yields were to increase by 1% per annum and by 39 million 2004: 40 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2005 levels.
Return of premium guarantee In 2005 Hibernian Life has written two tranches of linked bonds with a return of premium guarantee after five or six years.
The provision for these at the end of 2005 is 3 million.
It is expected that the provision would increase by 4 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2005 levels.
We would not expect any significant impact on this provision as a result of interest movements.
iv Spain and Italy Guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values The Group has also written contracts containing guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values in both Spain and Italy, where traditional profit-sharing products receive an appropriate share of the investment return, assessed on a book value basis, subject to a guaranteed minimum annual return of up to 6% in Spain and 4% in Italy.
Liabilities are generally taken as the face value of the contract plus, if required, an explicit provision for guarantees calculated in accordance with local regulations.
At 31 December 2005, total liabilities for the Spanish business were 2 billion 2004: 2 billion with a further reserve of 20 million 2004: 13 million for guarantees.
Total liabilities for the Italian business were 4 billion 2004: 4 billion, with a further provision of 55 million 2004: 49 million for guarantees.
Liabilities are most sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates.
It is estimated that provisions for guarantees would need to increase by 66 million 2004: 56 million in Spain and 12 million 2004: 14 million in Italy if interest rates fell by 1% from end 2005 values.
Under this sensitivity test, the guarantee provision in Spain is calculated conservatively, assuming a long-term market interest rate of 1.68% and no lapses or premium discontinuances.
d In providing these guarantees and options, the Groups capital position is sensitive to uctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, real estate prices and equity prices.
Interest rate guaranteed returns, such as those available on guaranteed annuity options GAOs, are sensitive to interest rates falling below the guaranteed level.
Other guarantees, such as maturity value guarantees and guarantees in relation to minimum rates of return, are sensitive to uctuations in the investment return below the level assumed when the guarantee was made.
