The overall impact of these higher taxes, which include the supplementary charge of 10% on UK North Sea profits, is subject to changes in enacted tax rates and the country mix of the groups income.
The UK government has announced that the supplementary charge will be increased to 20% with effect from 1 January 2006.
If this change is enacted, it will increase the groups ongoing effective tax rate by 1-2%, and will also require a deferred tax adjustment resulting in a further 2% increase in the tax rate for 2006.
The impact of this increase, together with the other factors outlined below, is likely to increase the effective tax rate by around 4-5% in future years.
Under International Financial Reporting Standards, the results of equity-accounted entities are reported within the groups profit before taxation on a post-tax basis.
The impact of this treatment is to reduce the reported effective tax rate by around 3%.
This effect is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
In 2005, the group released around $1 billion of income tax provisions that had been set up in previous years, reflecting a revised assessment of risks.
It is unlikely that a similar release of provisions will occur in future years.
At 31 December 2005, deferred tax liabilities were recognized for all taxable temporary differences: Except where the deferred tax liability arises on goodwill that is not tax deductible or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
At 31 December 2005, deferred tax assets were recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilized: Except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities, deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
The group has around $5.1 billion 2004 $7.7 billion and 2003 $4.5 billion of carry-forward tax losses in the UK and Germany, which would be available to offset against future taxable income.
At the end of 2005, $176 million of deferred tax assets were recognized on these losses 2004 no tax asset and 2003 $86 million of assets were recognized.
Tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that suitable taxable income will arise.
Carry-forward losses in other taxing jurisdictions have not been recognized as deferred tax assets and are unlikely to have a significant effect on the groups tax rate in future years.
The major component of temporary differences in the current year are tax depreciation, US inventory holding gains classified under other taxable temporary differences and derivative financial instruments.
Based on current capital investment plans, the group expects that temporary differences arising in future years from differences between tax allowances and depreciation will be at levels similar to the current year.
