Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 158 Financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 37 Liability for investment contracts a Carrying amount The liability for investment contracts at 31 December comprised: 2005 2004 m m Long-term business Participating contracts 47,258 43,974 Non-participating contracts at fair value 29,304 24,903 Non-participating contracts at amortised cost 747 678 30,051 25,581 Total 77,309 69,555 b Long-term business investment liabilities Investment contracts are those that do not transfer significant insurance risk from the contract holder to the issuer, and are therefore treated as financial instruments under IFRS.
Many investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature in which the contract holder has a contractual right to receive additional benets as a supplement to guaranteed benets.
These are referred to as participating contracts and are measured according to the methodology and group practice for long-term business liabilities as described in note 35.
They are not measured at fair value as there is currently no agreed denition of fair valuation for discretionary participation features under IFRS.
In the absence of such a denition, it is not possible to provide a range of estimates within which a fair value is likely to fall.
The IASB has deferred consideration of participating contracts to Phase II of its insurance contracts project.
For participating business, the discretionary participation feature is recognised separately from the guaranteed element and is classied as a liability, referred to as unallocated distributable surplus.
Guarantees on long-term investment products are discussed in note 38.
Investment contracts that do not contain a discretionary participation feature are referred to as non-participating contracts and the liability is measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
Most non-participating investment contracts measured at fair value are unit-linked in structure and the fair value liability is equal to the unit reserve plus additional non-unit reserves if required on a fair value basis.
For this business, a deferred acquisition cost asset and deferred income reserve liability are recognised in respect of transaction costs and front-end fees respectively, that relate to the provision of investment management services, and which are amortised on a systematic basis over the contract term.
The amount of the related deferred acquisition cost asset is shown in note 25 and the deferred income reserve is shown in note 45.
There is a small volume of annuity certain business for which the liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The fair value of contract liabilities measured at amortised cost is not materially different from the amortised cost liability.
