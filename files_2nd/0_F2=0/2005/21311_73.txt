Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31st December 2005 24 Current and deferred tax continued Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items: 2005 2004 m m Deductible temporary differences 340 Unused tax losses 363 17 Unused tax credits 24 18 The following tax losses expire: 10m in 2006: 8m in 2006-2008: and 78m in 2023-2025.
The other tax losses, tax credits and temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits.
The amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 2,126m 2004: 1,888m.
25 Insurance assets and liabilities Insurance assets including unit-linked assets Insurance assets, including assets held to cover linked and non-linked liabilities under UK GAAP at 31st December 2004, comprise the following: 2005 2004 m m Reinsurers share of provisions 114 109 Assets held to cover linked liabilities 5,870 Assets held to cover non-linked liabilities 2,597 Insurance assets including unit-linked assets 114 8,576 Reinsurance assets relate principally to the Groups long-term business.
Reinsurers share of provisions relating to the Groups short-term business are 15m 2004: nil.
Of the reinsurers share of provisions above, 99m 2004: 109m is expected to be recovered after more than one year.
From 1st January 2005, assets held to cover linked and non-linked insurance liabilities have been combined with other financial assets held by the Group in the appropriate balance sheet heading.

Insurance contract liabilities associated with the Groups short-term non-life business are 133m 2004: 48m.
In 2004, liabilities on products now classified as investment contracts under IAS 39 were reported within insurance liabilities above.
In 2005 these are reported in liabilities arising from investment contracts.
Barclays PLC 174 Annual Report 2005 25 Insurance assets and liabilities continued Movements in insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets Movements in insurance assets and insurance contract liabilities were as follows: 2005 Gross Reinsurance Net m m m At beginning of year 8,377 109 8,268 Effects of the adoption of IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Note 62 4,781 4,781 Acquisitions 252 29 223 Change in year 81 24 57 At end of year 3,767 114 3,653 Assumptions used to measure insurance liabilities The assumptions that have the greatest effect on the measurement of the amounts recognised above, and the processes used to determine them were as follows: Long-term business linked and non-linked Mortality mortality estimates are based on standard industry and national mortality tables, adjusted where appropriate to reflect the Groups own experience.
A margin is added to ensure prudence for example, future mortality improvements for annuity business.
Renewal expenses level and inflation expense reserves are a small part of overall insurance liabilities, however, increases in expenses caused by unanticipated inflation or other unforeseen factors could lead to expense reserve increases.
Expenses are therefore set using prudent assumptions.
Initial renewal expense levels are set by considering expense forecasts for the business and where appropriate building in a margin to allow for the increasing burden of fixed costs on the UK closed life book of business.
The inflation assumption is set by adding a margin to the market rate of inflation implied by index-linked gilt yields.
Short-term business Short-term business for single premium policies the proportion of unearned premiums is calculated based on estimates of the frequency and severity of incidents.
Changes in assumptions Sensitivity analysis regarding changes in these assumptions are described at Sensitivities on page 176.
There have been no changes in assumptions in 2005 that have had a material effect on the financial statements.
Uncertainties associated with cash flows related to insurance contracts and risk management activities Long-term insurance contracts linked and non-linked For long-term insurance contracts where death is the insured risk, the most significant factors that could detrimentally affect the frequency and severity of claims are the incidence of disease, such as AIDS, or general changes in lifestyle, such as in eating, exercise and smoking.
Where survival is the insured risk, advances in medical care and social conditions are the key factors that increase longevity.
The Group manages its exposure to risk by operating in part as a unit-linked business, prudent product design, applying strict underwriting criteria, transferring risk to reinsurers, managing claims and establishing prudent reserves.
Short-term insurance contracts For payment protection contracts where inability to make payments under a loan contract is the insured risk, the most significant factors are the health of the policyholder and the possibility of unemployment which depends upon, among other things, long-term and short-term economic factors.
The Group manages its exposure to such risks through prudent product design, efficient claims management, prudent reserving methodologies and bases, regular product, economic and market reviews and regular adequacy tests on the size of the reserves.
Absa insures property and motor vehicles, for which the most significant factors that could effect the frequency and severity of claims are climatic change and crime.
Absa manages its exposure to risk by diversifying insurance risks accepted and transferring risk to reinsurers.
3.5 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2005 175 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31st December 2005 25 Insurance assets and liabilities continued Concentration of insurance risk The Group considers that the concentration of insurance risk that is most relevant to the Group financial statements is according to the type of cover offered and the location of insured risk.
The following table shows the maximum amounts payable under all of the Groups insurance products.
It ignores the probability of insured events occuring and the contribution from investments backing the insurance policies.
The table shows the location of the insured risk and the broad product types: before and after the impact of reinsurance that represents the risk that is passed to other insurers.
2005 Before After reinsurance Reinsurance reinsurance m m m Total benefits insured by product type Long-term insurance contracts 28,877 12,128 16,749 Short-term insurance contracts 57,049 753 56,296 Total benefits insured 85,926 12,881 73,045 2005 Before After reinsurance Reinsurance reinsurance m m m Total benefits insured by geographic location UK 28,687 8,697 19,990 Europe 5,418 2,981 2,437 Africa 51,821 1,203 50,618 Total benefits insured 85,926 12,881 73,045 Credit risk For the long-term business, reinsurance programmes are in place to restrict the amount of cover to any single life.
The reinsurance cover is spread across highly rated companies to diversify the risk of reinsurer solvency.
Net of insurance reserves include a margin to reflect reinsurer credit risk.
Claims development The amount and timing of claims payments is normally within one year.
Sensitivity analysis The following table presents the sensitivity of the level of insurance contract liabilities disclosed in this note to movements in the actuarial assumptions used to calculate them.
The percentage change in variable is applied to a range of existing actuarial modelling assumptions to derive the possible impact on net profit after tax.
The disclosure is not intended to explain the impact of a percentage change in the insurance assets and liabilities disclosed above.
Net profit after tax impact Change in 2005 variable % m Long-term insurance contracts: Improving mortality annuitants only 10 19 Worsening of mortality assured lives only 10 28 Worsening of base renewal expense level 20 20 Worsening of expense inflation rate 10 5 Short-term insurance contracts: Worsening of claim expense assumptions 10 13 Any change in net profit after tax would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in shareholders equity.
The above analyses are based on a change in a single assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice this is unlikely to occur.
Barclays PLC 176 Annual Report 2005 25 Insurance assets and liabilities continued Capital position statement The Groups total capital resources available for its life insurance businesses were as follows: 2005 2004 Available capital resources for life business m m Total shareholders equity in the life business 417 276 Unallocated divisible surplus UDS and other sources of capital 15 Conversion to regulatory basis 36 8 Total available capital resources 396 284 Less: surplus 207 154 Capital resource requirement 189 130 2005 2004 Reconciliation of capital resources m m Shareholder equity available for life business see above table 417 276 Shareholders equity attributed to other businesses 17,009 15,594 Total shareholders equity excluding minority interests 17,426 15,870 Other capital resources attributable to other businesses 19,467 13,171 Total other capital resources 19,467 13,171 Total capital resources 36,893 29,041 Capital management and constraints on the transfer of capital Capital resource requirements are assessed at company level in accordance with local laws and regulations.
However, the aim is that each life fund should be able to meet its own liabilities.
In the event that this should not be the case, shareholders equity attributed to businesses other than life insurance are available to meet its liabilities to the extent that they could not otherwise be met.
Conversely, there are some constraints in moving capital out of the life funds.
The capital management objective is to ensure that sufficient capital is in place to meet liabilities as they fall due.
This is supported by risk management policies designed to manage key risks to the life business credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and insurance risk.
Capital management policies include requirements to: Manage credit risk by adopting prudent parameters as constraints for investment managers and by diversifying reinsurance amongst a selection of well capitalised providers.
Hold a suitably diversified portfolio of admissible assets of a value sufficient to cover technical provisions and of a suitable currency, term, safety, and yield to ensure that cash inflows from those assets will be sufficient to meet expected cash flows from its insurance liabilities as they fall due.
Although there are a number of factors influencing the capital position of the life business, the key factors include equity risk, inflation risk, mortality shock, and morbidity shock.
Liabilities are sensitive to a downturn in the economy and the investment market, such as increased mortgage protection claims, policy lapses and surrenders at a time when it is difficult to liquidate assets.
Barclays has a policy to choose assets which match the nature and the term of the liability and this policy would continue to be applied to any changes in market conditions.
Options and guarantees The Groups life contracts do not contain options or guarantees that could confer material risk.
