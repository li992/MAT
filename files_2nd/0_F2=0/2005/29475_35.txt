INSURANCE CONTRACT LIABILITY PROVISIONS CONTINUED The effect of changes in assumptions used to measure insurance assets and insurance liabilities The tables below set out the impact of actual changes in assumptions on insurance assets and liabilities and the sensitivity of the profit and loss and net assets to the key variables used to measure insurance assets and liabilities.
The analyses reflect the change in the variable assumption shown while all other variables assumptions are left unchanged.
In practice variables assumptions may change at the same time as some may be correlated for example, an increase in interest rates may also result in an increase in expenses if the increase reflects higher inflation.
It should also be noted that in some instances sensitivities are non-linear.
