Cattles ra2005 p85-101 29 3 06 4:06 pm Page 85 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 85 38 Transition to IFRS These financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 are the first annual financial statements that comply with IFRS.
The date of transition from UK GAAP to IFRS for the group and the company was 1 January 2004.
The group and the company have applied certain of the optional exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS and the mandatory exceptions of IFRS 1 First-time adoption of IFRS as follows: Exemptions from full retrospective application The group and the company have applied only the following optional exemptions: Business combinations The group has not restated any business combinations that took place prior to 1 January 2004.
Fair value as deemed cost The group has elected to use the previous revaluations of certain freehold and long leasehold properties under UK GAAP as the deemed cost of these assets as at 1 January 2004.
Share-based payment transactions The group and the company have applied IFRS 2 from 1 January 2004 to those share awards that were issued after 7 November 2002 but that have not vested by 1 January 2005.
Designation of financial assets and financial liabilities The group has reclassied certain current asset investments as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss as at 1 January 2004.
The group and the company have not elected to take advantage of the exemption from restating comparatives for IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4 given the nature of its business, and there being no similar exemption for IAS 17 in relation to lease and hire purchase receivables, in order that the 2004 comparatives are meaningful.
Exceptions from full retrospective application The group and the company have applied the following mandatory exceptions: Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Non-derivative financial assets and liabilities derecognised before 1 January 2004 are not re-recognised under IFRS.
The group and the company did not choose to apply the IAS 39 derecognition criteria from an earlier date.
Hedge accounting The group and the company have claimed hedge accounting with effect from 1 January 2005 where hedge relationships meet the hedge accounting criteria under IAS 39.
Estimates Estimates under IFRS at 1 January 2004 are consistent with estimates made for the same date under UK GAAP.
Assets held for sale and discontinued operations The group has applied IFRS 5 prospectively from 1 January 2005.
Therefore, the net assets of Cattles Commercial Finance Limited and Cattles Commercial Leasing Limited were not classied as held for sale at 31 December 2004, despite this group of net assets having met the criteria to enable such a classication to have been made.
Reconciliations between UK GAAP and IFRS In order to show the effect of the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS on the groups and the companys reported financial position and financial performance, IFRS 1 requires the following reconciliations to be presented and explained: A reconciliation of equity i. e. net assets at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004: and A reconciliation of profit for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Each of these reconciliations are presented and explained on pages 86 to 108.
In addition, in order to show the effect of the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS on the groups and the companys cash ows, reconciliations of cash ows for the year ended 31 December 2004 have also been given.

The effective interest method allocates the interest income arising from a loan over its expected life, or contractual life if shorter.
The effective interest rate EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the loan to its net carrying amount.
When calculating the EIR, all cash ows arising from the contractual terms of the loan, such as early settlement options, have to be considered.
The EIR calculation includes all direct and incremental fees and costs.
Consequently, acceptance fees and similar fees charged to customers on inception of the loan agreement, as well as commissions earned on the sale of payment protection insurance sold alongside the loan, are included as part of the EIR and effectively recognised over the expected term of the loan.
In addition, transaction costs incurred on inception of the loan, which are direct and incremental, such as broker commissions and certain agents commissions, are also included in the EIR and recognised over the expected period of the loan.
The application of the effective interest method has the effect of recognising income to give a constant rate of return on the amount outstanding from the customer over the period of the loan.
The effective interest method of income recognition differs to that which had been adopted by the group under UK GAAP.
Previously, interest receivable on secured and unsecured interest-bearing personal loan agreements was recognised on an accruals basis.
In the case of home collected credit, an initial amount of the interest receivable was credited to the income statement, mainly to cover the costs associated with setting up the transaction.
The remaining amount of interest was carried forward as deferred revenue and released on a straight line basis in proportion to the reduction in the customers outstanding balance.
In the case of hire purchase agreements, which now fall under the scope of IAS 17 Leases but where the accounting treatment is similar to that under IAS 39, interest receivable was previously computed at the inception of the loan, added to the customers balance and released to profit on the sum of the digits basis over the life of the agreement with unearned interest carried forward as deferred revenue.
Acceptance fees and similar fees, and payment protection insurance commissions, were previously recognised on inception of the loan agreement with an appropriate provision made for the rebate of such fees should a customer settle their loan early.
Under UK GAAP, a proportion of loan origination costs were spread over the life of the loan.
However, certain of these costs are not considered to be direct and incremental to individual loans as they relate to marketing and advertising costs.
Previously, acquired default debt, together with any fees incurred in initial court action, was included at cost and amortised over a period not exceeding six years at a rate based on the expected recoverability period of the debt.
In addition, costs of enforcements, incurred during the life of the debt, were amortised over the life of the enforcement action.
Under IFRS, the EIR calculation is based only on estimated expected collections and initial court costs with enforcement costs being charged to the income statement as incurred.
The derecognition rules within IAS 39 have also resulted in a change to how the liability for unallocable cash receipts is measured.
The total impact as at 1 January 2004 before any loan loss provisioning adjustment of loans and receivables being valued at amortised cost was a decrease in loans and receivables by 101.8 million, a decrease in trade and other receivables by 1.5 million, a decrease in trade and other payables by 27.5 million and a decrease in retained earnings by 75.8 million.
Cattles ra2005 p85-101 29 3 06 4:06 pm Page 89 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 89 IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial instruments Loan loss provisioning IFRS requires the group to assess at each balance sheet date whether there is any objective evidence that a loan or a group of loans is impaired.
If any such impairment exists, the amount of the loan loss provision is measured as the difference between the loans carrying amount on the balance sheet and the present value of estimated future cash ows excluding future credit losses not yet incurred discounted at the loans original EIR.
This methodology differs to that previously adopted under UK GAAP where the provision for doubtful debts was based on the number of months since a full payment, or equivalent, had been received from a direct repayment customer and, in the case of a home collected customers loan, was based on the level of payments received during the latest 13 week period of the loan.
There was no discounting under UK GAAP.
The different provisioning methodology results in a higher initial loan loss provision when a loan is impaired, consequently the impact as at 1 January 2004 was a decrease in loans and receivables by 40.1 million, a decrease in provisions by 0.6 million, a decrease in trade and other payables by 0.3 million and a decrease in retained earnings by 39.2 million.
IAS 21, IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial instruments Treasury and hedging Unlike UK GAAP, IAS 39 requires the fair value of the groups financial hedging instruments, being interest rate and cross-currency swaps, to be held on the balance sheet.
The derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
Furthermore, unlike UK GAAP, IAS 21 requires the groups US Dollar denominated borrowings to be re-translated at the spot rate, rather than the hedged rate.
Due to the hedge documentation requirements of IAS 39 having not been determined on transition at 1 January 2004, the group only achieved hedge accounting from 1 January 2005.
The impact of fair valuing the groups derivatives as at 1 January 2004, as well as the re-translation of the borrowings, was to recognise a new asset of 1.6 million for derivative financial instruments, a new liability of 21.2 million for derivative financial instruments, a decrease in borrowings by 13.7 million, a decrease in trade and other receivables by 0.8 million for the write-off of capitalised premiums in relation to interest rate caps and collars, a new hedging reserve of 5.0 million and a decrease in retained earnings by 1.7 million.
IAS 39 also requires that all the groups external borrowings are held at amortised cost with the interest expense recognised on the effective interest method.
The EIR of the borrowings is calculated taking into account direct and incremental legal fees incurred in arranging the borrowings.
This requirement resulted in a presentational change whereby accrued interest expense and unamortised legal fees are now presented on the balance sheet as part of the respective borrowings, rather than the accrued interest expense being part of accruals and unamortised legal fees being part of prepayments.
Furthermore, the need to amortise legal fees on an EIR basis over the life of the borrowing or facility also resulted in the unamortised legal fees balance being re-calculated on transition.
The impact of the presentational change and the re-working of the unamortised legal fees balance was a decrease in trade and other receivables by 4.1 million, a decrease in trade and other payables by 6.0 million, an increase in borrowings by 1.1 million and an increase in retained earnings by 0.8 million.
IAS 19 Employee benets IAS 19 requires the value of a dened benefit pension scheme to be included in the balance sheet of the sponsoring employer.
Therefore, the value of the deficit of the Cattles dened benefit pension scheme of 26.0 million, calculated by the schemes actuary as the present value of the pension obligations less the fair value of the schemes assets, has been recognised as a provision for retirement benefit obligations at 1 January 2004.
In addition, the prepayment of 0.1 million, which had arisen under UK GAAP accounting for pensions, has been removed by being written off to retained earnings on transition.
Furthermore, the scope of employee benets which have to be accounted for under IAS 19 is broader than under UK GAAP.
Consequently, the group has recognised a new accrual for holiday pay entitlement earned but not yet taken as at 1 January 2004 of 0.5 million.
Cattles ra2005 p85-101 29 3 06 4:06 pm Page 90 90 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 Notes to the Accounts 38 Transition to IFRS continued Reconciliations between UK GAAP and IFRS continued a Reconciliation of equity at 1 January 2004 Group continued IFRS 2 Share-based payments The group has a number of share award schemes, being the Restricted Share Scheme for senior executives, the Executive Share Option Scheme, the Share Incentive Plan and the Employee Sharesave Scheme SAYE.
IFRS 2 requires an expense to be recognised for share-based awards.
The expense is calculated by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options granted, using the Black-Scholes model, and is spread over the vesting period of the awards.
In arriving at fair values, various assumptions are made, for example, on expected forfeiture rates, dividend yields, share price volatility and risk free rates.
When a charge is recognised, a corresponding amount is recorded as an increase in equity.
This approach differs to that previously adopted by the group under UITF 17, whereby the expense was based on the share price at the date of appropriation or notional award.
Furthermore, an expense was only recognised in respect of the Restricted Share Scheme and the Share Incentive Plan with the corresponding entry being the recognition of a liability.
No charge was required to be made in respect of the Executive Share Option Scheme or the Employee Sharesave Scheme.
Given the different methodology for calculating the share-based payment charge, and the fact that only share awards made after 7 November 2002 which had not vested by 1 January 2005 are included in the scope of IFRS 2, the impact of adopting this standard has been positive.
This can be seen in the reconciliation as a decrease in trade and other payables by 4.2 million and an increase in retained earnings by a corresponding amount.
IFRS 3 Business combinations On transition to IFRS, the group was required to review the carrying value of goodwill for potential impairment.
This review showed that no impairment loss had occurred.
IFRS 3 has a strict denition of what qualies as a business within the context of a business combination.
The groups previous acquisitions of debt portfolios where no infrastructure was taken over do not meet this new denition and, therefore, goodwill relating to these acquisitions has had to be written off on transition.
The value of goodwill written off to retained earnings as at 1 January 2004 was 11.0 million.
IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date Under UK GAAP, dividends were recognised on the balance sheet when proposed.
IAS 10 prohibits the recording of a balance sheet liability in relation to proposed distributions until they have been approved.
Therefore, as at 1 January 2004, the groups proposed dividend liability of 26.6 million was removed and the amount was written back to retained earnings.
IAS 12 Income tax The transition to IFRS in areas such as loans and receivables, hedging instruments and the retirement benefit obligation has resulted in deferred tax assets arising from timing differences being recognised.
An adjustment to the net deferred tax asset of 46.9 million has been recognised at 1 January 2004.
Cattles ra2005 p85-101 29 3 06 4:06 pm Page 91 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 91 Others The adoption of IFRS has resulted in a number of other smaller or presentational changes, including the following: Reclassication of capitalised software IAS 38 Intangible Assets requires capitalised software costs to be recognised as an intangible asset rather than as a tangible xed asset as was the case under UK GAAP.
Therefore, capitalised software of a net carrying amount of 4.1 million has been reclassied from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets.
Capitalisation of software development costs Previously under SSAP 13 there was an option to capitalise software development expenditure provided certain criteria were met.
However, under IAS 38 costs arising from software development must be capitalised and recognised as an intangible asset if certain detailed criteria are met.
The groups project to develop the next generation of IT and customer relationship management systems meets these criteria such that staff and consultancy costs totalling 0.4 million have been written back to retained earnings and capitalised as an intangible asset.
Reclassication of investments Previously investments held by the groups reinsurance company were classied as current asset investments.
Under IFRS there is no similar broad classication, therefore, the investments were reclassied dependent on their nature.
The investments in xed interest securities were reclassied as investments held at fair value through profit or loss and xed interest bank deposits and other cash-based instruments were reclassied as cash equivalents.
Consequently, the amount of cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet increased by 12.3 million as at 1 January 2004.
Reclassication of provisions On transition to IFRS in order that the format of the groups balance sheet was in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, the groups provisions amounting to 2.6 million were reclassied from trade and other payables to provisions.
Reclassication of reserves On transition to IFRS, the previously revalued amounts of certain of the groups freehold and leasehold properties were treated as the deemed cost of these assets as permitted by the exemption contained in IFRS 1.
Therefore, there is no opening revaluation reserve on transition to IFRS and as such the balance on the revaluation reserve of 0.2 million was transferred into retained earnings.
In accordance with UITF 38, shares held in Cattles plc by the Employee benefit Trust were classied as part of retained earnings, whereas under IAS 32, this own shares held balance of 3.7 million has been reclassied from retained earnings to a separate own shares held reserve.

IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial instruments Loan loss provisioning The recognition of loan loss provisioning under the IAS 39 methodology resulted in a decrease in loans and receivables by 62.6 million, a decrease in provisions by 0.7 million, a decrease in trade and other payables by 0.4 million and a decrease in retained earnings by 61.5 million.
IAS 21, IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial instruments Treasury and hedging The impact of fair valuing the groups derivatives, re-translating the US Dollar denominated borrowings and recognising the borrowings on an effective interest method was to recognise a new asset of 0.9 million for derivative financial instruments, a new liability of 23.6 million for derivative financial instruments, an increase in borrowings by 6.2 million, a decrease in trade and other payables by 29.6 million, a decrease in trade and other receivables by 5.7 million, a new hedging reserve of 1.5 million and an increase in retained earnings by 3.5 million.
IAS 19 Employee benets The adoption of IAS 19 in relation to the groups dened benefit pension scheme and a holiday pay accrual resulted in a new provision for retirement benefit obligations of 28.9 million, a decrease in trade and other receivables by 0.2 million, an increase in trade and other payables by 0.5 million and a decrease in retained earnings by 29.6 million.
IFRS 2 Share-based payments The adoption of IFRS 2 resulted in a decrease in trade and other payables by 4.8 million and an increase in retained earnings by a corresponding amount.
IFRS 3 Business combinations Under IFRS 3 goodwill is no longer amortised annually, rather it is subject to an annual impairment review.
Therefore, amortisation recognised under UK GAAP for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 3.2 million has been written back to the balance sheet.
This adjustment, along with the write off of goodwill relating to acquisitions which fail to meet the denition of a business combination of 11.0 million, resulted in a net reduction to goodwill and retained earnings of 7.8 million.

IAS 12 Income tax An adjustment to deferred tax of 59.6 million prior to the reclassication of the 3.5 million deferred tax liability has been recognised as at 31 December 2004 in relation to timing differences arising from the IFRS transitional adjustments in areas such as loans and receivables, hedging instruments and the retirement benefit obligation.
Others The impact of other transitional adjustments as at 31 December 2004 included: Reclassication of capitalised software 9.9 million has been reclassied from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets.
Capitalisation of software development costs 0.8 million has been written back to retained earnings and capitalised as an intangible asset.
Revision of freehold property residual values The residual values and useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment were reviewed as at the date of transition, such that the depreciation charged on certain freehold properties was revised resulting in an increase in their net book value by 0.2 million.
Reclassication of investments 75.0 million has been reclassied as cash equivalents.
Reclassication of provisions 6.3 million has been reclassied from trade and other payables to provisions.
Reclassication of reserves The revaluation reserve of 0.2 million has been transferred into retained earnings and the own shares held balance of 3.9 million has been reclassied from retained earnings to a separate own shares held reserve.

These fees were previously recognised on inception of the loan agreement with an appropriate provision made for the rebate of such fees should a customer settle their loan early.
In addition under IFRS, insurance commissions on health, life and mechanical breakdown insurance products are recognised in line with the incidence of risk and reinsurance premiums on all products are earned over the expected life of the insurance policies.
Therefore, for the year ended 31 December 2004, revenue from fees was 8.1 million lower and revenue from insurance commissions and reinsurance premiums was 19.1 million lower.
In addition, cost of sales were 0.2 million lower.
Interest income The EIR calculation takes account of cash ows arising from all contractual terms of the loan agreement, including the early settlement option for which a fee is charged.
Consequently, interest income before the gross-up adjustment was 16.3 million higher for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Loan origination costs As only direct and incremental costs being broker commissions and certain agents commissions are included in the EIR calculation, and hence effectively presented as part of revenue rather than being classied as part of cost of sales or administrative expenses, this has resulted in a decrease in revenue by 30.3 million, a decrease in cost of sales by 42.6 million and an increase in administrative expenses by 16.7 million.

Management has, therefore, decided that this additional interest should not actually be charged to customers, and therefore a corresponding loan loss provisioning charge is made.
The impact on profit is zero, but the revenue and loan loss provisioning charge lines are effectively grossed-up by the same amount.
The income gross-up adjustment for the year ended 31 December 2004 was 18.8 million.
Acquired default debt Under UK GAAP the amount of cash collections received from acquired default debt was treated as revenue.
In addition, the purchase price for the debt, alongside initial court costs and subsequent enforcement costs, was capitalised and amortised through to profit over the expected collections period of the debt within cost of sales.
However, under IAS 39 acquired default debt is recognised using the effective interest method.
As the enforcement costs are not direct to the initial acquisition of the debt, these costs are now recognised as incurred.
The different income and cost recognition rules have had the impact for the year ended 31 December 2004 of decreasing revenue by 19.1 million and decreasing cost of sales by 17.6 million.
Unallocable cash receipts Under IAS 39 the liability to repay unallocable cash receipts is only derecognised when the legal obligation has been extinguished, such that the unallocable cash receipts are recognised as income only after six years have elapsed.
Previously such unallocable receipts had been credited to profit as part of administrative expenses within two years of their receipt.
Therefore, the impact of this change to income recognition for the year ended 31 December 2004 was to increase revenue by 0.4 million and increase administrative expenses by 0.5 million.
Cattles ra2005 p85-101 29 3 06 4:06 pm Page 98 98 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 Notes to the Accounts 38 Transition to IFRS continued Reconciliations between UK GAAP and IFRS continued c Reconciliation of profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 Group continued IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial instruments Loan loss provisioning Under IAS 39 loan loss provisions must be measured as the difference between the loans carrying amount on the balance sheet and the present value of estimated future cash ows discounted at the loans original EIR.
This approach differs to the bad debt provisioning methodology which had been adopted under UK GAAP which was based around the amount and recency of the customers last few payments, and which did not take account of discounting.
The impact on the loan loss provisioning charge being calculated in accordance with IAS 39 before the gross-up adjustment for the year ended 31 December 2004 was an increase of 22.5 million.
As explained in the preceding section, the loan loss provisioning charge gross-up adjustment for the year was 18.8 million.
Therefore, the total adjustment to profit was a decrease of 41.3 million.
IAS 21, IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial instruments Treasury and hedging As the group did not apply hedge accounting for 2004, a net loss on fair valuing the derivative financial instruments of 3.3 million was recognised as a charge within administrative expenses for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Under IAS 21, it was also necessary for the US Dollar denominated borrowings to be re-translated at the spot rate prevailing at 31 December 2004.
This gave rise to a foreign exchange gain of 4.0 million classied within finance costs.
Under IAS 39, in the absence of hedge accounting, it is necessary to amortise the transitional hedging reserve as a finance cost through the income statement.
The amortisation charged in any one period is calculated so as to reect how the hedged item has affected profit or loss in the same period.
An amortisation charge of 3.4 million was therefore recognised for the year ended 31 December 2004 within finance costs.
The adoption of IAS 39 also resulted in an increase in finance costs by 0.3 million due to legal fees arising on the arrangement of borrowings being recognised on an effective interest method and a decrease in finance costs by 0.4 million as a result of the write back of the amortisation of previously capitalised interest rate cap and collar premiums.
Cattles ra2005 p85-101 29 3 06 4:06 pm Page 99 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 99 IAS 19 Employee benets The adoption of IAS 19 in relation to the groups dened benefit pension scheme resulted in a reduction in the pension charge included within administrative expenses of 0.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2004.
However, an actuarial loss of 2.5 million net of tax was recognised through the statement of recognised income and expense.
IFRS 2 Share-based payments Primarily due to awards made before 7 November 2002 and not vested by 1 January 2005 being excluded from the scope of IFRS 2, the share-based payments charge for the year ended 31 December 2004 was lower under IFRS by 1.6 million.
IFRS 3 Business combinations As goodwill is no longer amortised under IFRS, the UK GAAP amortisation charge for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 3.2 million has been added back to profit.
IAS 12 Income tax As a result of the adjustments to certain income and expenditure items arising under IFRS, a deferred tax credit of 11.6 million has been recognised for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Others The adoption of IFRS also resulted in a decrease in administrative expenses by 0.7 million and the reclassication of income of 3.6 million earned on xed interest bank deposits from finance costs to revenue.
In addition, in accordance with IAS 1, the groups finance costs are now disclosed separately on the face of the income statement, rather than being included in total cost of sales 74.6 million : and dividends are no longer presented as part of the income statement, rather they are shown as a deduction from equity.

Denition of cash and cash equivalents The cash ows reported under IAS 7 relate to movements in cash and cash equivalents, whereas FRS 1 required the movements in cash only.
There was no concept of cash equivalents under FRS 1 and any cash ows relating to short-term highly liquid investments were included in the heading management of liquid resources.
Previously, the group had presented cash ows arising from the current asset investments held by the reinsurance company within management of liquid resources, therefore on transition to IFRS those investments which met the denition of a cash equivalent which amounted to 12.3 million at 1 January 2004 were reclassied and included within the increase or decrease of cash and cash equivalents during 2004.
The current asset investments which did not meet the cash equivalent denition were reclassied as investments held at fair value through profit or loss, and the cash inow of 48.9 million during 2004 arising from the disposal of these assets prior to reinvestment in bank deposits has been included within investing activities in the IFRS cash ow statement.
Under UK GAAP, the groups syndicated bank borrowings were included in the denition of cash for the purposes of the cash ow statement.
This treatment is not permitted under IAS 7, therefore the opening cash and cash equivalents balance as at 1 January 2004 has been restated by 390.3 million, and cash ows arising from the issuance and repayment of bank borrowings are now included within nancing activities in the cash ow statement.
In addition, under IFRS, borrowings includes obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts and therefore the capital element of hire contract payments has been reclassied in the cash ow statement as repayment of borrowings.
Other presentational changes IAS 7 only requires cash ows to be reported under three headings: operating, investing and nancing, whereas FRS 1 required cash ows to be reported under nine headings including separate headings for cash ows arising from taxation and equity dividends.
Under IAS 7 tax cash ows are now included within operating activities and equity dividend payments are included within nancing activities.
Reclassication of software-related cash ows Given that certain software development costs are now being capitalised in accordance with IAS 38 rather than being expensed as incurred, the amount of cash outow from operations before tax paid has reduced by 0.4 million.
The cash outows arising from software development expenditure are now included within investing activities.
On transition to IFRS, capitalised software has been reclassied from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets.
Therefore, cash ows arising from the purchase or disposal of software are now shown separately within the investing activities section of the cash ow statement.
Purchase of own shares The nancing cash ow for the purchase of own shares under UK GAAP of 0.2 million has been restated to only include the cash consideration paid of 1.1 million, with the remaining 0.9 million, relating to the vesting of shares, being reclassied as an operating cash ow.
e Reconciliation of equity at 1 January 2004 Company The adoption of IFRS has also had a significant impact on the equity, profits and cash ows of the company.
These impacts are shown in the company reconciliations on pages 102 to 108.
The explanations behind the IFRS adjustments contained in these reconciliations are consistent with those described in relation to the group on pages 88 to 101.
