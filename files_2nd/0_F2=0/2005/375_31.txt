The net book value of intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives is 3.4 million 2004: 3.1 million, principally relating to trade names.
These are considered to have indefinite lives because it is the Groups intention to continue to invest in these assets and by doing so, their value will be protected and indeed enhanced.
This continued investment will involve significant expenditure on training, recruitment, technological development and legal protection.
3.1 million 2004: 2.8 million of these assets are included within the Aegis Media business segment and the Americas geographical segment and 0.3 million 2004: 0.3 million are included within corporate operations.
Internally-generated intangible assets of 4.0 million 2004: 0.8 million have not yet been subject to amortisation as development of these assets is not yet complete.
