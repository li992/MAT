Goodwill is subject to impairment testing under IFRS, rather than the amortisation rules applied under UK GAAP.
No impairment has been identified at 1 January 2004. ii Retirement benefit obligations: IFRS requires the pension schemes deficits on the defined benefit pension plans to be recognised on the Groups balance sheet at date of transition.
The impact of this requirement is a 8,544,000 reduction to net assets at 1 January 2004.
Pension prepayments carried under UK GAAP were written back and the related deferred tax reversed on transition to IFRS.
The net impact is a reduction to net assets of 780,000 at 1 January 2004. iii Trade and other payables: Dividends proposed after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are finalised were treated as an adjusting post balance sheet event under UK GAAP and accrued in the financial statements.
Such dividends are treated as non-adjusting balance sheet events under IFRS and are not accrued.
The impact is an increase in net assets of 5,460,000 at 1 January 2004. iv All above adjustments were recorded against the opening retained earnings at 1 January 2004.
The total net impact is a decrease in retained earnings of 3,864,000.

The impact of the reversal of the UK GAAP amortisation is an increase in net assets of 5,761,000.
This had been partially offset by impairment of 534,000 recognised under IFRS at 31 December 2004.
IFRS requires intangible assets, where meeting the IFRS definition and where fair value can be measured reliably, to be recognised separately from goodwill.
A value of 534,000 has been reallocated from goodwill to intangible assets relating to the acquisition of IADC Ltd. ii Intangible assets: A value of 560,000, converted at date of acquisition of IADC Ltd November 2004, which was subsumed in goodwill under UK GAAP, has been provisionally attributed to intangible assets.
Amortisation of 260,000 has been recognised in the income statement in the period, the impact being a reduction in net assets of 256,000 when converted at 31 December 2004.
The balance of the intangible asset after amortisation, and converted at 31 December 2004, is 278,000. iii Retirement benefit obligations: IFRS requires the pension schemes deficits on the defined benefit pension plans to be recognised on the Groups balance sheet at date of transition.
The Group has elected to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in full as they arise in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The impact of this requirement is a 12,397,000 reduction to net assets at 31 December 2004.
The net impact is a reduction to net assets of 560,000 at 31 December 2004. iv Trade and other payables: Dividends proposed after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are finalised were treated as an adjusting post balance sheet event under UK GAAP and accrued in the financial statements.
The impact is an increase in net assets of 5,627,000 at 31 December 2004.
