Summary of differences between IFRS and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles From 3 January 2005, the Group has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU see Note 40.
IFRS differs in certain respects from US generally accepted accounting principles US GAAP.
Set out below is a summary of the significant differences and related adjustments to reconcile consolidated profit for the financial period and consolidated shareholders equity under IFRS to US GAAP.
IFRS as adopted by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
However, the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented would be no different had the Group applied IFRS as issued by the IASB.
References to IFRS hereafter should be construed as references to IFRS as adopted by the EU.
As a result of the Groups transition to IFRS on 29 December 2003, the reconciliations of net income and net equity for 2004 published in previous periods have been amended to reflect the restated consolidated profit and shareholders equity reported in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Under the IFRS transition provisions within the Securities and Exchange Commissions Form 20-F requirements, the Group is permitted to provide two years of comparable financial information under IFRS and reconciliations to US GAAP for the periods presented.

US GAAP adjustments in respect of discontinued operations were a charge of 12 million 2004: 4 million credit.
The adjustments reflected the effects of interest capitalisation and restructuring costs.
In addition, in 2005, an US GAAP adjustment was recorded to reverse a deferred tax credit arising on the intra-group transfer of intellectual property assets recorded under IFRS.

From 1998 to 2003, acquired goodwill was capitalised and its subsequent measurement via annual impairment review or annual amortisation charge was determined based on the individual circumstances of each business acquired.
A portion of the goodwill capitalised from 1998 to 2003, related to associates, was not amortised under UK GAAP.
Upon IFRS adoption, the Group exercised the exemption available under IFRS 1 First time Adoption of IFRS not to restate business combinations prior to the date of transition of the Groups reporting GAAP from UK GAAP to IFRS and as a consequence such goodwill is permanently written-off against reserves.
Since 29 December 2003, amortisation on goodwill ceased.
Acquired goodwill continues to be capitalised, but is not amortised.
Under IFRS, goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment where there is an indication that an impairment may have occurred or else annually.
Any impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of goodwill for each Cash Generating Unit CGU with their recoverable amount.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement, within Profit from Operations.
For the purposes of US GAAP, all goodwill written off against reserves under IFRS is reinstated as an asset on the balance sheet.
Under US GAAP, for periods ending on or before 30 December 2001, goodwill was amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life, not to exceed 40 years.
Effective 31 December 2001, the Group adopted SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
The statement requires that goodwill not be amortised but rather be tested at least annually for impairment.
The Group carries out an annual impairment review of goodwill as at the year-end date.
Under US GAAP impairment reviews are carried out at the reporting unit level, which are sub-divisions of the Groups reporting segments.
The impairment review process compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including the associated goodwill.
The fair value of each reporting unit is valued using a discounted cash flow methodology.
These cash flows are discounted at rates that management estimate to be the risk affected average cost of capital for the particular businesses.
If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the Group performs an additional step to calculate the total amount of the goodwill impairment.
This second step involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognised intangible assets.
An impairment charge is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds any residual unallocated fair value.
An historic reconciling adjustment in Shareholders Equity exists reflecting the different accounting for goodwill prior to 29 December 2003.
No impairments have been identified under either IFRS or US GAAP in 2005 or 2004.
Consequently, there is no reconciling item in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the Groups US GAAP goodwill during 2005: Americas Americas EMEA Europe Asia Beverages Confectionery Beverages Pacific Total m m m m m m Book value at beginning of year restated 1,886 1,007 899 426 347 4,565 Exchange rate adjustments 208 86 9 92 13 224 Goodwill acquired 811 10 Adjustments pursuant to completion of purchase price allocation 4 4 Disposals 3 20 23 Transfers to assets held for sale 335 335 Book value at end of year 2,091 1,093 896 357 4,437 The prior year analysis of goodwill and intangible assets resulted in an amount that was classified as intangible assets rather than goodwill.
A reclassification out of intangible assets into goodwill has been made in the US GAAP balance sheet.
b Intangible assets Under IFRS, the cost of brands acquired must be capitalised and, if the life of the asset is deemed to be indefinite, no amortisation or writedown is required unless there is an impairment in value below cost.
On at least an annual basis, the Group reviews nonamortised identifiable intangible assets for possible impairment using an estimate of the related discounted cash flows in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.
Under US GAAP, an intangible asset in a business combination should be recognised i if it arises from contractual rights or other legal rights regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the acquired entity or from other legal rights or obligations or ii it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or otherwise exchanged.
Under US GAAP, intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortised but are tested at least annually for impairment.
Intangible assets that have finite lives are amortised over their useful lives.
Customer relationships, acquired with Adams meet the definition of an intangible asset under US GAAP but did not meet the requirement to be capitalised as an intangible under UK GAAP.
As the Group exercised the IFRS 1 exemption not to restate business combinations the item is treated as goodwill under IFRS.
Consequently, these customer relationships are transferred from goodwill to intangibles for the purposes of US GAAP reporting.
As these intangibles are deemed to have a definite life an amortisation charge is recorded under US GAAP that is not present under IFRS.
In addition, as a result of historical differences between IFRS and US GAAP relating to the amortisation policy of intangible assets, at 29 December 2003, an on-going reconciling adjustment in Shareholders Equity exists.
Report & Accounts 2005 Cadbury Schweppes 153 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 42.
Summary of differences between IFRS and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles continued b Intangible assets continued The following table provides a reconciliation of the Groups US GAAP intangible assets during 2005: Other Indefinite Definite definite life life brands life brands intangibles Total m m m m Cost at beginning of year 2,080 23 242 2,345 Accumulated amortisation at beginning of year 288 8 40 336 Book value at beginning of year restated 1,792 15 202 2,009 Exchange rate adjustments 183 5 25 294 Reallocation to definite life brands 10 10 Reallocation from goodwill Acquisitions 25 25 Amortisation 6 22 28 Transfers to assets held for sale 349 349 Book value at end of year 1,641 24 205 1,870 The book value at the end of the year is analysed below: Other Indefinite Definite definite life life brands life brands intangibles Total m m m m Cost at end of year 1,929 38 267 2,234 Accumulated amortisation at end of year 288 14 62 364 Book value at end of year 1,641 24 205 1,870 The weighted average amortisation period for the definite life intangibles is 20 years 2004: 20 years.
The total amortisation charge expected under US GAAP in 2006 is 26 million.
As a consequence of the pattern of the amortisation applied this annual charge will fall in each of the following four years, to be approximately 20 million in 2009.
The principal component of other definite life intangibles relates to customer relationships.
c Interest capitalisation Under IFRS, the capitalisation of interest is optional and the Group does not capitalise such interest.
Under US GAAP interest is required to be capitalised on capital construction projects and amortised over the life of the asset.
d Derivative instruments Under IFRS, certain derivative instruments were not required to be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value until 3 January 2005.
At this date, the Group adopted IAS 39 under IFRS on a prospective basis, requiring recognition of all derivative instruments at fair value on the balance sheet.
Under IFRS, the Group has not applied hedge accounting to all of its derivative instruments.
Therefore, movements in the fair value of such derivatives are reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement as a component of Finance cost.
Under US GAAP, consistent with IFRS, all derivatives are recorded in the financial statements at fair value.
Since the Group has not designated its derivatives as hedges all movements in the fair value of derivatives are reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement as a component of Interest expense.
However, since US GAAP has required derivatives to be held on the balance sheet at fair value since 1 January 2001, there is an adjustment of 58 million included in shareholders equity under US GAAP as at 29 December 2003 and a gain of 15 million recognised as a reconciling item between profit under IFRS and US GAAP in 2004.
Subsequent to 3 January 2005, the only difference in the accounting for derivatives under IFRS and US GAAP is the unwinding of the transition accounting upon initial adoption of SFAS 133 and IAS 39, resulting in a gain of 24 million recognised as a reconciling item between profit under IFRS and US GAAP in 2005.
154 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts 2005 e Deferred taxation The fundamental basis of recognising deferred taxes is the similar under both IFRS and US GAAP, however certain detailed differences exist.
Under IFRS, deferred tax is based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted.
For US GAAP, only tax rates and laws that have been enacted are taken into account.
In addition under IFRS, deferred tax is recognised on the difference between the carrying amount determined using the historical rate of exchange and the balance sheet date exchange rate.
Under US GAAP, no deferred tax is recognised for differences related to assets and liabilities that are remeasured from local currency into the functional currency resulting from changes in exchange rates.
These differences have not resulted in material differences in 2005 and 2004, and as a consequence there is no reconciling item between IFRS and US GAAP.
Under IFRS, deferred tax is recognised on intra-group transfers of assets and liabilities, including transfers of intellectual property assets.
Under US GAAP the recognition of deferred tax on such transactions is not permitted.
In 2005, a deferred tax credit that was recorded under IFRS on an intra-group transfer of assets was reversed in arriving at US GAAP.
For US GAAP, deferred tax assets for share awards are recorded based on the recorded compensation expense.
Under IFRS deferred tax assets are recognised based on the intrinsic gain at the year-end.
The amount recognised in the Income Statement is capped at the tax effected share award charge, with any excess being recognised directly through reserves.
A historic difference related to the deferred tax on intangible assets remains after the transition to IFRS.
Under UK GAAP residual payments on certain acquisitions were classified as brand intangibles.
Under US GAAP these were treated as goodwill.
Under IFRS, the UK GAAP classification was maintained resulting in the recognition of deferred tax liabilities on these brand intangibles.
Under US GAAP, no deferred tax liability was recognised as these non-tax deductible amounts were classified as goodwill.
In addition, deferred taxation has been provided on accounting GAAP differences between IFRS and US GAAP.
Under IFRS, the Group must disclose the gross deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current.
Under US GAAP deferred taxes are classified between current and non-current portion, depending on the items they relate to, disclosed separately and presented on a net basis, by tax jurisdiction.
The analysis of the deferred taxes under US GAAP is as follows: 2005 2004 m m Current Short-term temporary differences assets 149 197 Short-term temporary differences liabilities 52 137 97 60 Non Current Operating losses carried forward 177 136 Fixed asset temporary differences 88 62 Intangible temporary differences 289 299 200 225 Total temporary differences 103 165 Valuation allowances 165 124 Net deferred tax liability 268 289 The movement in the valuation allowance during the year is set out below: m At 2 January 2005 124 Exchange rate adjustments 10 Creation of tax losses 31 At 1 January 2006 165 f Property revaluations On transition to IFRS, the Group has exercised the exemption available under IFRS 1 First time Adoption of IFRS to treat the depreciated revalued cost of properties which were revalued under historical UK GAAP up to 1999 as the deemed cost.
These revaluations were not permitted under US GAAP and remain a difference between IFRS and US GAAP.
Report & Accounts 2005 Cadbury Schweppes 155 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 42.
Summary of differences between IFRS and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles continued g Retirement benefits Under IFRS, the Group recognises the full deficit, calculated using a projected unit credit method, of its post-retirement employee benefits in its consolidated financial statements using a 1 January 2006 measurement date.
Under US GAAP, the costs of providing these benefits are also calculated using the projected unit credit method, however a 30 September 2005 measurement date has been applied.
Under US GAAP actuarial gains and losses are amortised over the remaining expected service life of the scheme members.
For the purposes of amortising gains and losses, the 10% corridor has been adopted, and the market-related value of assets recognises realised and unrealised capital gains and losses over a rolling three year period.
As this results in differing assets from IFRS, different expected returns on assets arise.
In addition, under US GAAP, a minimum pension liability is recognised, as a component of other comprehensive income, in certain circumstances when there is a deficit of plan assets relative to the accumulated benefit obligations.
In 2005, the higher US GAAP charge reflects the recognition of net actuarial losses in prior years, lower expected asset returns as a consequence of applying the market related value approach and the initial recognition of liabilities for an insignificant scheme.
Additionally, the shareholders equity reconciliation has been affected by the movement in the Additional Minimum Liabilities for certain of the Groups plans.
The major retirement plans as detailed in Note 18, are reviewed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS 87, annually and the disclosures below have been presented in accordance with SFAS 132.
Where appropriate, additional pension charges in respect of curtailment or settlement events, have been calculated in accordance with SFAS 88.
Post retirement medical benefit plans are assessed annually for materiality.
Amounts for these plans were not significant and consequently have not been separately disclosed.
The net periodic pension cost for the major plans under SFAS 87 and SFAS 88 was made up as follows: 2005 2004 m m Service cost 91 72 Employee contributions 10 9 Interest cost 124 110 Expected return on assets 123 111 Recognition of actuarial gain loss 19 14 101 76 2005 2004 m m The US GAAP amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements were: Prepaid benefit cost 27 23 Accrued benefit liability 224 272 197 249 Intangible asset 49 Accumulated other comprehensive income 53 120 Net amount recognised 140 120 Under IFRS, actuarial gains and losses related to post-retirement employee benefits are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, outside of the Income Statement.
156 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts 2005 The weighted average assumptions used across the major pensions plans at the end of the financial year and used to determine the benefit obligations were as follows: 2005 2004 %% Discount rate 5.0 5.4 Long-term rate of return on assets 7.2 7.4 Earnings increase 4.2 4.4 The movement in the benefit obligation and plan assets was as follows: 2005 2004 m m Benefit Obligation At beginning of year 2,185 2,007 Other additional plans 108 12 Exchange rate adjustments 28 15 Service cost 81 63 Interest cost 124 110 Actuarial gain loss 127 100 Amendments 11 3 Benefits paid 97 99 Employee contributions 11 11 Expenses and tax paid 2 1 At end of year 2,554 2,185 Plan Assets At beginning of year 1,734 1,596 Other additional plans 85 4 Acquisitions disposals 2 Exchange rate adjustments 17 6 Actual return on plan assets 352 178 Benefits paid 97 99 Employer contributions 87 49 Employee contributions 11 11 Expenses and tax paid 2 1 At end of year 2,187 1,734 Funded status 367 451 Unrecognised prior service cost 6 4 Unrecognised net actuarial loss gain 204 323 Amount contributed to plan during fourth quarter 29 4 Accrued Prepaid cost 140 120 The aggregate funded status of pension plans can be analysed as follows: For plans with Projected Benefit Obligation in excess of plan assets Aggregate Projected Benefit Obligation 2,450 2,108 Aggregate fair value of plan assets 2,080 1,650 The aggregate figures for plans in which the Accumulated Benefit Obligation exceeds plan assets can be analysed as follows: Aggregate Accumulated Benefit Obligation 2,066 1,871 Aggregate fair value of plan assets 1,860 1,639 Report & Accounts 2005 Cadbury Schweppes 157 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 42.
Summary of differences between IFRS and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles continued g Retirement benefits continued UK pension scheme disclosures The UK pension scheme accounts for over 70% of the Groups total benefit obligations.
The Trustees of the main UK Scheme have three key investment objectives to guide them in their strategic management of the Funds assets.
The acquisition of appropriate assets, which will generate income and capital growth and which together with new contributions from both members and the Group, will meet the cost of current and future benefits provided by the Fund.
To limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities over the long term and in relation to the statutory UK Minimum Funding Requirement MFR.
c. To minimise the long term costs of the Fund by maximising the return on the assets, whilst having regard to the objective under b above.
The Trustees seek to achieve these objectives through investing in a mixture of real and monetary assets.
In so doing, they recognise that returns on real assets, while expected to be greater over the long term than those on monetary assets, are likely to be more volatile.
A mixture across asset classes should provide the level of returns required by the Fund to meet its liabilities at an acceptable level of risk for the Trustees and an acceptable level of cost to the Group.
The Trustees have undertaken an asset and liability modelling exercise ALM with the assistance of the main UK schemes actuary.
The ALM looked at a number of different investment scenarios and projected both a range and a best estimate of likely returns from each one, from which the Trustees determined the structure they feel most comfortable with.
The long term asset allocation deemed appropriate to meet the Trustees objectives following this review was as follows: Equities 60% Bonds 25% Property 10% Other, including private equity 5% The Trustees are considering a move to a higher proportion of bonds and an offsetting lower proportion of equities.
The breakdown of the market value of the main UK Schemes assets and the rate of return assumption applied in calculating the net benefit cost under US GAAP split between the different asset categories are as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Share of Share of Share of assets assets assets %%% Equities 61% 61% 65% Bonds 25% 26% 22% Property 9% 8% 8% Other, including private equity 5% 5% 5% 100% 100% 100% The expected rate of return assumptions have been determined following consultation with the Groups local actuarial advisers.
The Group has taken direct account of the actual investment strategy of the associated pension schemes and expected rates of return on the different asset classes held.
In the case of bond investments, the rates assumed have been directly based on market redemption yields at the measurement date, whilst those on other asset classes represent forward-looking rates that have typically been based on other independent research by investment specialists.
The assumptions that were used in calculating the benefit obligation and net benefit cost for US GAAP purposes for the main UK scheme were: As at As at 30 September 30 September 2005 2004 % pa % pa Discount rate 5.0% 5.5% Long-term asset return 7.1% 7.4% Earnings increases 4.2% 4.5% Pension increases 2.7% 2.7% Under US GAAP the measurement date used for pension accounting is 30 September 2005.
The current best estimate of cash payments to be made into the UK schemes for 2006 is 120 million.
The Accumulated Benefit Obligation of the main UK Scheme as at 30 September 2005 amounted to 1,769 million 2004: 1,458 million.
158 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts 2005 The current best estimate of future benefit payments to members of the UK scheme after 1 January 2006 are set out below: Annual payments m 2006 66 2007 69 2008 72 2009 76 2010 79 Aggregate for financial years 2011 to 2015 452 Overseas disclosures The Group has a number of overseas pension plans, the most significant of which are those in the USA, Canada, Australia and Ireland.
The detail of the investment objectives of the schemes within these countries varies from plan to plan however the overall objectives are similar to those of the UK scheme.
The breakdown of the market value of the overseas schemes assets and the rate of return assumptions applied in calculating the net benefit cost under US GAAP split between the different asset categories are as follows: 2005 2004 Share of Share of assets assets %% Equities 66% 67% Bonds 23% 20% Property 6% 7% Other 5% 6% 100% 100% The expected rate of return assumption has been determined in a manner consistent with that used by the UK scheme.
The assumptions that were used in calculating the benefit obligation and net benefit cost for US GAAP purposes for the overseas schemes were not significantly different to either those used for the UK scheme or the Group as a whole.
The Group has a number of post retirement medical benefit plans, principally in the US and Canada.
The assumed health care cost trend rates for 2005 are 10%, grading down to 5% over periods between 10 and five years.
The effect of a 1% increase and decrease on the service and interest component of the net period service cost and the accumulated benefit obligations for these schemes would not be significant.
h Disposal gain adjustment Due to differing treatment of goodwill and intangible assets under IFRS and US GAAP see Note 42 a and b, differences arise on the profit on sale of subsidiaries and investments.
Prior to 29 December 2003, cumulative foreign exchange gains and losses relating to disposals were adjusted within reserves.
Since 29 December 2003, cumulative gains and losses are included in determining the profit or loss on disposal of the business.
At that date, the Group opted to set the cumulative translation reserve to nil as permitted.
Under US GAAP, such gains and losses are also included in determining the profit and loss on disposal but they are tracked from the date of acquisition of the entity.
As such the disposal gain recorded in the period was lower under US GAAP relative to IFRS.
i Restructuring Under IFRS, a provision for restructuring is required to be recognised when an entity is demonstrably committed to the restructuring.
US GAAP requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognised and measured at fair value when the liability is incurred.
Under US GAAP, an entitys commitment to a plan, by itself, does not create a present obligation to others that meets the definition of a liability.
The timing of recognition and related measure of one-time termination benefit arrangements provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated is dependent upon the arrangement meeting specific criteria mentioned above, and if the employees are required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive the termination benefits and, if so, whether employees will be retained to render service beyond a minimum retention period.
If employees are not required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive the termination benefits that is, if employees are entitled to receive the termination benefits regardless of when they leave or if employees will not be retained to render service beyond the minimum retention period, a liability for the termination benefits shall be recognised and measured at its fair value at the date the arrangement is communicated.
Report & Accounts 2005 Cadbury Schweppes 159 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 42.
Summary of differences between IFRS and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles continued i Restructuring continued In respect to other exit costs, US GAAP requires that liabilities are recognised when they are incurred, which is normally when the goods or services associated with the activity are received.
Additional information regarding the restructuring costs on an IFRS basis is provided in Note 4.
As a consequence certain restructuring costs that require recognition under IFRS may not be recognised under US GAAP.
j Employee Share arrangements Under IFRS, the Group recognises a charge based on the grant date fair value of the share awards, for all share based awards.
Under US GAAP, prior to 2 January 2006, the Group applied US Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations when accounting for its share option plans.
Under APB 25, compensation expense was determined as the difference between the market price and exercise price of the share-based award.
For fixed plans compensation expense is determined on the date of grant.
For variable plans compensation expense is remeasured at each balance sheet date until the award becomes vested.
123 R Share-Based Payment FAS 123 R on 3 January 2005.
FAS 123 R requires the recognition of compensation expense in the Consolidated Income Statement related to the fair value of employee share-based awards.
123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes APB 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Since 3 January 2005, the Group has recognised the cost of all unvested employee stock options on a straight-line attribution basis over their respective vesting periods, net of estimated forfeitures.
The Company has selected the modified prospective method of transition: accordingly, prior periods have not been restated.
k Basis of consolidation Under IFRS, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and those entities over which it exerts, or has the potential to exert, control.
Control is usually obtained via a majority of voting rights in that entity.
Under US GAAP, a company must assess if the entities with which it has business relationships are Variable Interest Entities VIE.
VIEs are entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
If an entity is a VIE the reporting company is required to assess whether it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
IFRS SIC 12 has a similar objective to US GAAP but requires an examination of the substance of the relationship which considers both voting rights, economics and other relevant factors.
In addition, IFRS applicability can differ in scope from US GAAP.
Cadbury Schweppes Delaware LP is a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company and is the issuer of the Quarterly Income Preferred Securities.
The results of the entity and its financial position are consolidated under IFRS.
The Group has determined that the entity meets the definition of a VIE and that the Group is not the primary beneficiary of this entity.
Hence for US GAAP purposes Cadbury Schweppes Delaware LP has been deconsolidated.
l Minority Interest Under IFRS, the Company records minority interest on acquisitions at fair value.
Under US GAAP the minority interest at acquisition is recorded at historical cost.
The difference does not affect shareholders equity or net income under US GAAP.
