NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 week period ended 1 October 2005 1 Accounting policies The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the period and the preceding period: a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
b Basis of consolidation The statutory Group profit and loss account and balance sheet consolidate the financial statements of Topps Tiles Plc and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 1 October 2005.
The financial statements of Topalpha Limited have been consolidated using merger accounting principles.
In all other cases, subsidiary undertakings have been accounted for using acquisition accounting principles and incorporate the results of the Groups joint venture undertaking.
The Group accounts for its own share of assets, liabilities and cash flows associated with this joint venture.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed.
No profit and loss account is presented for Topps Tiles Plc, as permitted by S230 of the Companies Act 1985.
The Companys profit after tax for the period, determined in accordance with the Act, was 38,738,000 2 October 2004 - 36,035,000. c Financial period The accounting period ends on the Saturday which falls closest to 30 September, resulting in financial periods of either 52 or 53 weeks.
d Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised and written off on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, which is twenty years.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Goodwill of 15,080,000 arising on acquisitions in the period ended 30 May 1998 was written off to reserves in accordance with the accounting standard then in force.
As permitted by the current accounting standard the goodwill previously written off to reserves has not been reinstated on the balance sheet.
On disposal or closure of a previously acquired business, the attributable amount of goodwill previously written off to reserves is included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
e Turnover Turnover comprises the net amount receivable in respect of retail sales less goods returned during the period from third parties and excludes value added tax.
TOPPS TILES PLC 41 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the 52 week period ended 1 October 2005 1 Accounting policies continued f Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Costs are only those costs that are directly attributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of tangible assets, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Freehold buildings - 2% per annum on cost on a straight-line basis Short leasehold land and buildings - over the period of the lease, up to 25 years Fixtures and fittings - over 10 years or at 25% per annum on reducing balance basis as appropriate Motor vehicles - 25% per annum on reducing balance Freehold land is not depreciated.
Residual value is calculated on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition.
g Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes materials and an attributable proportion of distribution overheads based on normal levels of activity.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
h Taxation UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Group's taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
i Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the forward contract rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of overseas operations are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account.
TOPPS TILES PLC 42 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 1 Accounting policies continued k Leases Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned assets, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful lives.
The capital elements of future obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Hire purchase transactions are dealt with similarly, except that assets are depreciated over their useful lives.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are similarly spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where the period to the review date on which the rent is first expected to be adjusted to the prevailing market rate is shorter than the full lease term, in which case the shorter period is used.
l Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
m Pension costs For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
n Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For a forward foreign exchange contract to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or to a probable commitment.
It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
Gains and losses arising on these contracts are deferred and recognised in the profit and loss account, only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in the Groups financial statements.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example, because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at that time.
o Finance costs Finance costs of debt are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Finance costs which are directly attributable to the construction of tangible fixed assets are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
The commencement of capitalisation begins when both finance costs and expenditures for the asset are being incurred and activities that are necessary to get the asset ready for use are in progress.
Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities that are necessary to get the asset ready for use are complete.

Consequently the main risks arising from the Groups operations are liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain continuity of funding through the use of retained profits and medium to long-term borrowings.
The maturity profiles of the Groups borrowings are detailed in section c of this note.
Interest rate risk The Groups objective is to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations whilst trying to minimise the cost of capital of the Group.
Currency risk The Group has transactional currency exposures which arise from purchases by subsidiary undertakings in currencies other than the functional currency of the Group.
The Groups policy is to periodically use forward contracts to hedge those transactions to eliminate any significant currency exposure.
The frequency and amount hedged is decided by the Board and depends upon the magnitude of the exposure and volatility of the currency involved.
a Interest rate profile The currency profile of the Groups financial assets is as follows: Group 1 October 2 October 2005 2004 000 000 Sterling 27,940 29,719 Euro 164 33 Dollar 275 62 27,829 29,624 Financial assets liabilities comprise short term cash deposits with major United Kingdom clearing banks with associated right of off-set and deposits placed on money markets at call.
The financial assets liabilities earn floating rates of interest based upon bank base rates.
