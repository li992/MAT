PENSION COMMITMENTS The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes for its employees, the Northgate Information Solutions Pension Scheme the Northgate Scheme and the Rebus Group Pension Scheme the Rebus Scheme.
Benefits are related to salary close to retirement or leaving service if earlier and also to years of pensionable service.
Assets are held in separate, trustee administered funds.
Employer contributions to the schemes are determined on the basis of regular valuations undertaken by independent, qualified actuaries.
The schemes are closed to new employees, who are instead eligible to join either the defined contribution section of the Northgate Scheme or another defined contribution scheme.
The Northgate Scheme The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the Northgate Scheme was conducted as at 31 March 2002 using the projected unit method.
As at that date, the market value of the assets was 90.4 million and, on the valuation assumption, these assets were sufficient to cover 97% of the liabilities.
The key valuation assumptions related to the rates of return on investments and rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
The pension cost in the accounts includes the regular cost plus a variation in cost and, for the purposes of producing Company accounting information, calculations were produced as at 30 April 2002 and the following assumptions were used: % p. a.
Investment return before retirement 6.25 Salary increases 3.00 Pension increases for service from April 1997 2.70 Pension increases in excess of GMPs, for service up to April 1997 2.50 The total pension cost of the defined benefit part of the Northgate Scheme charged to the profit and loss account for the year to 30 April 2005 was 2,320,000 2004: 2,266,000 which includes an addition for the amortisation of the experience deficit of 1,669,000 2004: 1,599,000.
Employer contributions to the defined benefit part of the Northgate Scheme during the year amounted to 2,320,000 2004: 2,266,000.
This represents broadly 14.3% of members Pensionable Salaries.
The contributions paid to the defined contribution section of the scheme amounted to 394,000 2004: 271,000.
The pension cost figures used in these accounts comply with the current pension cost accounting standard SSAP24.
Under transitional arrangements, the Company is required to disclose the following information about the scheme and the figures that would have been shown under the UK standard FRS17 in the current balance sheet.
58 NORTHGATE INFORMATION SOLUTIONS PLC An estimate of the liabilities of the defined benefit scheme was updated to 30 April 2004 and 30 April 2005, by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS17.
As required by FRS17, the defined benefit liabilities have been measured using the projected unit method.
The Scheme is closed to new entrants and, under the method used to calculate pension costs in accordance with FRS17, the cost as a percentage of payroll will tend to increase as the average age of the membership increases.
The major assumptions used by the actuary in respect of the FRS17 calculations were as follows: At 30 April 2005 At 30 April 2004 At 30 April 2003 % p. a.
Discount rate 5.40 5.70 5.40 Rate of increase in salaries 2.90 3.00 3.00 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.50 2.80 2.60 Inflation assumption 2.70 2.80 2.60 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, were: Long term rate of Long term rate of Long term rate of return expected Value at return expected Value at return expected Value at at 30 April 2005 30 April 2005 at 30 April 2004 30 April 2004 at 30 April 2003 30 April 2003 % 000 % 000 % 000 Equities 7.0 72,676 7.5 69,438 6.8 56,363 Gilts 4.5 11,403 5.0 9,288 4.3 14,542 Bonds 5.3 11,180 5.7 9,459 - - Other 4.6 414 4.0 741 4.3 4,193 Total market value of assets 95,673 88,926 75,098 Present value of scheme liabilities 134,953 124,574 123,874 Deficit in the scheme 39,280 35,648 48,776 Related deferred tax asset 11,784 10,694 14,633 Net pension liability 27,496 24,954 34,143 NORTHGATE INFORMATION SOLUTIONS PLC 59 Notes to the Accounts continued 28.

It is expected that some or all of these employees will transfer to the Northgate Scheme in due course.
On the assumption that all members transfer, the value of the assets, as at 30 April 2005, is expected to be 16.8 million.
The corresponding FRS17 liabilities assessed on the same actuarial assumptions as those used for the Northgate Scheme, as at 30 April 2005, are expected to be 17.6 million.
The Rebus Scheme The Group operating company, Northgate HR Limited acquired on 23 January 2004 also operates a defined benefit scheme the Rebus Group Pension Scheme for its employees whose benefits are related to salary close to retirement or leaving service if earlier and also to years of pensionable service, with the assets held in a separate, trustee administered fund.
The contributions to the Scheme are determined on the basis of regular valuations undertaken by independent, qualified actuaries.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Rebus Scheme was conducted as at 1 April 2002 using the projected unit method.
As at that date, the market value of the assets was 58.3 million and, on the valuation assumptions, these assets were sufficient to cover 77% of the liabilities.
In accordance with FRS7 fair values in acquisition accounting, a provision of 18,000,000 representing the deficit in the Scheme was adopted as at 23 January 2004.
A related deferred tax asset of 5,119,000 was included in the accounts.
The pension cost in the accounts includes the regular cost plus a variation in cost and, for the purposes of producing Company accounting information, the following assumptions were used: % p. a.
Investment return before retirement 6.25 Salary increases 3.00 Pension increases for service from April 1997 2.70 The total pension cost of the defined benefit scheme charged to the profit and loss account for the year to 30 April 2005 was 2,053,000 period 23 January 2004 to 30 April 2004: 743,000.
This includes a reduction of 143,000 for the amortisation of the experience surplus 2004: addition of 136,000 for amortisation of experience deficit.
Provisions for liabilities and charges include 17,063,000 at 30 April 2005 17,813,000 at 30 April 2004 in respect of pension costs representing the cumulative difference between pension costs charged to the profit and loss account and the amounts funded.
Employer contributions to the defined benefit part of the Rebus Scheme during the year amounted to 2,053,000 2004: 2,266,000.
This represents broadly 19.9% of members pensionable salaries.
The contributions paid to the defined contribution section of the Scheme amounted to 165,000 2004: 271,000.
Under transitional arrangements, the Company is required to disclose the following information about the Scheme and the figures that would have been shown under the UK standard FRS17 in the current balance sheet.
