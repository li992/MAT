Provisions i Decommissioning Costs 2005 2004 000 000 At 1 January 70,679 47,524 Acquisition of Subsidiaries 16,744 New Provisions and Changes in Estimates 20,337 3,764 Disposal of Oil and Gas Assets 6,854 Decommissioning Payments 91 263 Unwinding of Discount Note 5 5,157 3,653 Currency Translation Adjustment 1,911 743 At 31 December 91,139 70,679 The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to the UK, West Africa and Pakistan oil and gas interests, which are expected to be incurred between 2006 and 2025.
These provisions have been created based on Tullows internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Assumptions, based on the current economic environment, have been made which management believes are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.

Although the UK Government has raised the rate of Supplemental Corporation tax rate with effect from 1 January 2006, the deferred tax balances in the UK ring fence have been calculated at the rate of 40% which is the rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
