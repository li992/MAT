The aim was to improve the tradeability of the companys shares.
A special resolution was passed at the annual general meeting in April 2004, which was subsequently approved by the Court in Jersey, to extinguish accumulated losses by reducing the companys share premium account by US$100 million.
Other reserves include the cumulative charge recognised under IFRS 2 in respect of share option schemes net of amounts transferred to share capital and share premium and the mark-to-market valuation of financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges.
Refer to note 6 for discussion on the impact of IFRS 2.
# Restricted shares were issued to directors as remuneration.
Of these shares, 103 910 have vested, while the remainder of the shares are still held by the company as treasury shares.
The transfer between other reserves and share premium in respect of the shares vested represents the cost calculated in accordance with IFRS 2.
