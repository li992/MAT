Accordingly the financial instruments disclosure presented in this note on the basis of IAS 32 and IAS 39 is only for 2005.
The UK GAAP FRS 13 disclosures for 2004 are shown in note 33. a Treasury policy Treasury policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are available for the development of the Groups business whilst managing its currency, interest rate and counterparty credit risks.
The Groups treasury policy is not to engage in speculative transactions.
Group treasury acts within clearly defined guidelines that are approved by the Board.
b Risk identification and management There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the key risks faced by the Group.
Activities are co-ordinated by the Risk Committee, which is chaired by the CFO, and has responsibility, on behalf of the Board, for ensuring the adequacy of systems for identifying and assessing significant risks, that appropriate control systems and other mitigating actions are in place, and that residual exposures are consistent with the Groups strategy and objectives.
Assessments are conducted for all material entities.
c Interest rate risk and hedge accounting The Group's policy is to fix interest rates for a significant portion of the debt, 61% as at 31 December 2005 using forward rate or interest rate swap agreements.
Significant interest rate management programmes and instruments require the specific approval of the Board.
The weighted average interest rate of fixed rate debt was 7%.
Where project finance is utilised, our policy is to align the maturity of the debt with the contractual terms of the customer offtake agreement.
The Group accounts for interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges where the forecast transaction is highly probable and the hedge is assessed as effective.
Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 115 Effective interest rates and repricing analysis The following is a table illustrating the effective interest rates of interest earning financial assets and interest bearing financial liabilities at 31 December 2005 and the period in which they reprice: 31 December 2005 Effective Total Less than 1-2 2-3 3-4 4-5 More than interest 12 months years years years years 5 years rate m m m m m m m Financial assets Finance lease receivable: Euro 7.9% 460 12 12 14 15 16 391 Assets held for trading: Australian dollars 5.5% 52 52 Cash and cash equivalents: Australian dollars 5.4% 109 109 Czech koruna 1.9% 4 4 Euro 2.4% 55 55 Sterling 4.5% 331 331 US dollars 4.3% 109 109 Other currencies 3.2% 12 12 Total financial assets 1,132 684 12 14 15 16 391 Financial liabilities Secured bank loans: Australian dollars 6.7% 1,108 40 41 80 71 46 830 Effect of interest rate swap 0.7% 701 17 160 169 71 266 18 Czech koruna 2.8% 55 8 47 Effect of interest rate swap 0.8% 40 40 Euro 4.8% 371 21 22 24 23 27 254 Effect of interest rate swap 0.4% 43 5 5 8 21 4 Sterling 6.8% 335 85 17 15 22 17 179 Effect of interest rate swap 0.3 % 192 19 12 10 15 136 US dollars 7.2% 1,013 31 33 37 31 540 341 Effect of interest rate swap 0.2% 440 56 23 24 200 17 232 Other currencies 7.7% 26 2 2 2 3 3 14 Sub total secured bank loans 6.6% 2,908 187 162 158 150 633 1,618 Sub total of effect of interest rate swaps 0.4% 1,416 15 240 211 307 423 250 Preferred equity: US dollars 7.2% 173 173 1 Convertible bond : US dollars 7.4% 125 125 Secured bonds: Sterling 8.3% 445 445 Loans from minority interests: US dollars 8.0% 81 21 60 Total financial liabilities 3,732 187 183 331 150 693 2,188 1 The effective interest rate for the convertible bond represents the liability element and the equity component refer to note 24 for further details.
The effect of interest rate swaps refers to the annual movements in the principal amount of the interest rate swap, and are included in the above table to identify to which financial liability they relate.
They are not included within total financial liabilities shown above as they are recognised as derivative financial instruments in the balance sheet.
The effect of the Group interest rate swaps effectively replaced 701 million of floating rate Australian dollar borrowings, 440 million of floating rate US dollar borrowings, 192 million of floating rate sterling borrowings, 40 million of floating rate Czech koruna borrowings and 43 million of floating rate euro borrowings with fixed rate borrowings.
Management estimates that a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have the effect of decreasing the Groups profit before tax by approximately 8 million.
116 International Power Annual Report 2005 32 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 2005 continued The floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank borrowings bearing interest rates fixed in advance for various time periods up to 12 months by reference to LIBOR for that time period.
d Energy trading risk, energy market risk and hedge accounting The Group hedges exposures that arise from the ownership and operation of power plants and related sales of electricity and purchases of natural gas, and utilises derivatives to optimise the return achieved from these assets.
The Group enters into derivative commodity financial instruments to convert floating or indexed electricity and gas prices to fixed prices in order to lessen its vulnerability to reductions in electricity prices for the electricity it generates and to increases in gas prices for the fuel it consumes in its power plants.
Commodity derivative financial instruments also provide a way to meet customers pricing requirements while achieving a price structure consistent with the Groups overall pricing strategy.
Energy market risk on our asset and proprietary portfolios is measured using various techniques including Value-at-Risk VaR.
VaR is used where appropriate and provides a fair estimate of the net losses or gains which could be recognised on our portfolios over a certain period and given a certain probability: it does not provide an indication of actual results.
Scenario analyses are used to estimate the economic impact of sudden market movements on the value of our portfolios.
This supplements the other techniques and methodologies and captures additional market risks.
The Group accounts for certain energy sales and fuel purchases as cash flow hedges where the forecast transaction is highly probable and the hedge is assessed as effective.
e Currency exposures Currency translation exposure The results of the Groups foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the period concerned.
The balance sheets of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the closing exchange rates.
In order to hedge the net assets of foreign operations, borrowings are generally in the same currency as the underlying investment.
The Group aims to hedge a reasonable proportion of its nonsterling assets in this way.
It is our policy not to hedge currency translation through foreign exchange contracts or currency swaps.
Currency transaction exposure This arises where a business unit makes sales and purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.
Transaction exposure also arises on the remittance from overseas of dividends or surplus funds.
The Group's policy is to match transaction exposure where possible, and hedge remaining transactions as soon as they are committed, by using foreign currency contracts and similar instruments.
Currency exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.
Management estimates that a one percentage point weakening of sterling against all currencies would reduce the Groups profit before tax by approximately 3 million.
f Borrowing facilities The Group has substantial borrowing facilities available to it.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31 December 2005 in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met at that date amount to 441 million.

2 This facility includes a US$50 million supported and US$60 million unsupported working capital credit facility with capacity to issue letters of credit.
At 31 December 2005, 8 million and 22 million of letters of credit had been drawn from each of these facilities respectively.
3 This facility could have been utilised to draw cash and issue letters of credit in relation to merchant trading support.
It was not renewed when it expired in January 2006.
4 These facilities can be utilised to issue letters of credit.
At 31 December 2005, 93 million of letters of credit had been drawn from these facilities and 28 million of cash and cash equivalents was used as collateral in relation to these facilities.
Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 117 Uncommitted facilities available at 31 December 2005 were: 31 December 2005 Total Drawn Undrawn m m m Facility Bank borrowing and overdraft facilities 36 18 18 11 million Subsidiary facilities in various currencies 11 2 9 47 20 27 Bank borrowing facilities are normally reaffirmed by the banks annually although they can theoretically be withdrawn at any time.
g Fair values of financial assets and liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and fair values of all the Groups financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2005: 31 December 2005 Carrying amount Fair value m m Financial assets Other investments 4 4 Finance lease receivables 460 460 Other long-term receivables from joint ventures and associates 30 30 Trade receivables current 163 163 Other receivables current 108 108 Derivative financial instruments 268 268 Assets held for trading 52 52 Cash and cash equivalents 620 620 Total financial assets 1,705 1,705 Financial liabilities Trade payables current 118 118 Other payables current 153 153 Derivative financial instruments 687 687 Secured bank loans 2,908 2,928 Preferred equity facility 173 173 Convertible bonds 125 125 Secured bonds 445 480 Loans from minority interests 81 81 Total financial liabilities 4,690 4,745 The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: i Other investments comprise equity held in privately owned, unquoted companies and therefore fair value cannot be reliably measured.
The fair value has thus been based on the cost amount.
ii The fair value of finance lease receivables and other long-term receivables have been estimated by discounting estimated cash flows.
iii Trade and other receivables current and trade and other payables current are stated at fair value, set equal to book value, because of their short maturity.
iv Assets held for trading have been estimated using quoted market prices and discounted cash flows.
v The fair value of the Groups forward exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and foreign currency options have been calculated using market rates in effect at the balance sheet dates.
vi The fair value of energy derivatives is measured using discounted cash flows and other similar quantification techniques.
Where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques.
These include using recent arms length market transactions, reference to the current market value of another instrument which is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models.
vii All loans and bonds have been calculated using market prices where available or the net present value of future cash flows arising.
h Hedges As explained on pages 38 and 39 of the business and financial review, the Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: i Interest rate risk using interest rate swaps, options and forward rate agreements.
ii Structural and transactional currency exposures using currency borrowings, forward foreign currency contracts, currency options and swaps.
118 International Power Annual Report 2005 32 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 2005 continued iii Currency exposures on future expected sales using currency swaps, forward foreign currency contracts, currency options and swaps.
iv Energy price fluctuations using physical hedges through the operation of energy supply and trading activities together with financial products.
The hedging of structural currency exposures associated with foreign currency net investments is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.
i Cash flow hedging reserve movements The following shows the cash flow hedging reserve balance at 31 December 2005 and the periods in which the cash flows are expected to occur: Interest Energy Total rate derivatives swaps m m m Unrecognised losses at 31 December 2005 15 103 118 Cash flows expected during 2006 2 67 69 2007 1 27 28 2008 1 10 11 2009 1 1 2010 onwards 10 10 15 103 118 Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserves during the year were as follows: Interest Energy Total rate derivatives swaps m m m Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve on adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 at 1 January 2005 20 8 12 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised during the year 2 7 9 Amount removed from equity and included with a non-financial item 5 5 Amount recognised in equity 2 104 102 15 103 118 j Hedge of a net investment A foreign currency exposure arises from net investments in Group entities whose functional currency differs from the Groups presentation currency.
The risk is defined as the risk of fluctuation in spot rates between the functional currency of the net investments and the Groups presentation currency.
This will cause the amount of the net investment to vary.
In the absence of hedge accounting the foreign exchange gains and losses on retranslating the net assets of the foreign operation would be taken to reserves, whilst those on the loan would be recognised in the income statement.
This creates a mismatch in foreign currency translation.
When net investment hedging is applied, this mismatch is eliminated.
The Group, as part of its hedging strategy, has therefore chosen to borrow some debt denominated in foreign currencies in order to hedge the net investments in certain assets within its portfolio.
As the hedging instrument is foreign currency borrowings rather than a derivative, no fair value for this instrument is included within the fair value of derivatives disclosed on the balance sheet.
k Counterparty credit risk The Groups policy is to manage its credit exposure to trading and financial counterparties within clearly defined limits.
Energy trading activities are strictly monitored and controlled through delegated authorities and procedures, which include specific criteria for the management of counterparty credit exposures in each of our key regions.
Counterparty exposure via customer offtake agreements is monitored and managed by the local asset team with assistance from Group treasury where appropriate.
In addition, Group treasury manages the Group-wide counterparty credit exposure on a consolidated basis for financial counterparties, with the active and close involvement of the global risk manager.
Financial counterparty credit exposure is limited to relationship banks and commercial paper with strong investment grade credit ratings.
We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event that counterparties to traded contracts and financial instruments do not perform according to the terms of the contract or instrument.
This is mitigated by the fact that for the majority of the Groups commodity trading arrangements there is a legally enforceable right of set-off that reduces the credit exposure of the Group in the event of counterparty default.
Where possible the Group will also enter into master netting agreements that further serve to mitigate its credit exposure.
With regard to financial instruments subject to credit risk, we select counterparties with appropriate ratings for the size, type and duration of the instrument involved.
A small proportion of counterparties trading energy are below investment grade.
For those energy market transactions with counterparties below investment grade, and which are not supported by appropriate collateral, reserves are carried against the trading risk.
Exposures within this band are restricted and closely monitored within narrow limits.
We do not expect any significant credit loss to result from non-performance of instruments or traded contracts.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a net positive fair value by counterparty at 31 December 2005.
At 31 December 2005, the exposures for interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward exchange contracts were not considered to be material.
Contracts for differences also involve a degree of credit risk.
This risk is controlled by appropriate authorisation and monitoring procedures.
