Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 106 Financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards continued 6 Longer-term investment return The Group has chosen to revisit its longer-term investment return LTIR methodology from 2005 as part of a discretionary change not required by IFRS.
In order to provide suitable trend analysis, the 2004 comparatives are presented in accordance with this new methodology.
The key changes are as follows: For properties and equity, we have applied lower start of year long-term rates of investment return consistent with those adopted for reporting life operating returns under EEV principles.
This would have reduced operating profit in 2004 by 25 million: For xed income securities, we have included the amortisation of the premium or discount arising upon acquisition of a bond within our LTIR calculation.
This would have reduced operating profit before tax by 72 million in 2004: The LTIR is only being applied to general insurance and health business.
These changes have no effect on profit before tax.
vi Reconciliation of the cash ows reported under UK GAAP to cash ows reported under IFRS Under UK GAAP, as amended by the ABI SORP for insurance companies, the consolidated statement of cash ows presents only the cash ows of general insurance business and shareholders funds.
Cash ows of the long-term business, other than amounts transferred to shareholders, are not included in this statement.
IAS 7, Cash Flow Statements, requires the cash ow statement to include cash ows from all activities of the Group, including the reconciliation of cash ows from operating activities to profit or loss reported in the income statement.
Other differences arise between the UK cash ow statements and IFRS, mainly due to reclassication of items under IFRS.
For the year ended 31 December 2004, the only material differences between the cash ow statements prepared under the two bases were the inclusion of cash ows from the Groups long-term businesses and from newly-consolidated securitisation vehicles and investment vehicles, together with changes arising from the different denitions of cash and cash equivalents under these bases.
