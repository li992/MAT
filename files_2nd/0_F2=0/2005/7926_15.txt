DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT In setting three elements to the performance criteria for LTIP awards, the Remuneration Committee decided that these were the most important measures that drive or measure sustainable improvement in shareholder value.
The TSR criteria reflect comparative performance against the appropriate FTSE sector and a bespoke comparator group of companies.
The EPS criterion reflects a key part of the Groups strategy to create sustainable shareholder value.
Under the LTIP rules, should Imperial Tobacco be acquired, the performance period would come to an end on the date of acquisition.
Any outstanding awards would vest on a time pro-rata basis, subject to the achievement of the applicable performance criteria.
On vesting, a participant is granted a nil cost option to acquire the relevant number of shares.
The option may be exercised at any time up to the seventh anniversary of its date of grant.
It is anticipated that the first awards on the basis set out above will be made during November 2005.
An amendment to the LTIP Rules will be proposed at the 2006 AGM to remove the current rule that no award can be granted within three years of the Plan retirement date currently age 65 and replace this with a rule that no awards can be made within six months of expected retirement.
Further details of the proposed amendment are contained in the accompanying notice of the 2006 AGM.
During the year, the November 2001 November 2004 award vested in full.
Annual growth in EPS over the period averaged 21.77 per cent exceeding the average of 10 per cent, the threshold at which the award maximises.
There have been no changes in any Directors awards since 30 September 2005.
