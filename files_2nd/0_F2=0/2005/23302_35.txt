Notes to the Accounts 15 NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE Total shareholders funds have been calculated in accordance with the provisions of FRS 4 Capital Instruments.
The analysis of total shareholders funds on the face of the balance sheet does not reflect the rights, under the Articles of Association, of the ordinary shareholders on a return of assets.
These rights are reflected in the net asset value and the asset value per share attributable to ordinary shareholders at the year end, adjusted to reflect the deduction of the debenture stock at par.
A reconciliation between the two sets of figures follows:- 2005 2004 Total shareholders funds 981,770,000 883,641,000 Less: Debenture stock discount 65,000 69,000 Debenture stock issue expenses 4,332,000 4,579,000 Adjusted net assets 977,373,000 878,993,000 Number of equity shares in issue at year end 239,446,714 242,796,714 Total shareholders funds per share 410.02p 363.94p Less: Unamortised debenture stock discount and issue expenses 1.84p 1.91p Adjusted net asset value per share 408.18p 362.03p 2005 2004 000 000 The movements during the year of the assets attributable to the ordinary shares were as follows:- Adjusted net assets at 31 March 2004 878,993 676,419 Total recognised capital gain for the year 109,592 204,479 Revenue return for the year 29,660 29,771 Dividend appropriated in the year 31,420 31,927 Movement in unamortised debenture stock discount and issue expenses 251 251 Repurchase of ordinary shares 9,703 - Adjusted net assets at 31 March 2005 977,373 878,993 The net asset value adjusted to include the debenture stocks at market value rather than at par is 383.05p 2004: 335.72p.
