c Pension costs The principal pension arrangement operated by the Group is a funded scheme providing benefits on both a defined benefit basis and a defined contribution basis.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
A valuation of the defined benefit section of the scheme is undertaken by an independent qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are paid in accordance with his recommendations.
The last full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section was carried out as at 1 August 2002 and used the attained age method.
That valuation has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 July 2005.
In the formal valuation the assumption which has the most significant effect on the results of the valuation is the difference of 2.5% per annum between the yield on the funds assets over the rate of salary increases.
The assets of the defined benefit arrangement had a market value at 1 August 2002 of 20,234,000.
The value of the assets was sufficient to cover 72% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The shortfall is being charged to the profit and loss account over the expected remaining working lives of current employees.
The pension charge of 2,372,000 2004 - 2,521,000 includes 1,649,000 2004 - 1,829,000 in respect of the defined benefit arrangement and 723,000 2004 - 692,000 in respect of the defined contribution arrangement.
