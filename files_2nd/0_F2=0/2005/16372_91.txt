Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 19 Financial instruments The Group has comprehensive policies in place, approved by the Boards, covering the use of derivative financial instruments.
These instruments are used for hedging purposes.
Established controls are in place covering all financial instruments.
These include policies, guidelines, exposure limits, a system of authorities and independent reporting.
Performance is closely monitored with independent reviews undertaken by internal audit.
Hedge accounting principles are described in note 1 on pages 83 and 84.
The use of leveraged instruments is not permitted.
Details of the instruments used for interest rate and foreign exchange exposure management, together with information on related exposures, are given below.
Unilevers interest rate management policy is described in note 2 on pages 86 and 87.
The Groups exposure to interest rates is mainly xed by xed rate long-term debt issues and straightforward derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps.
In general, cash is invested short-term at oating interest rates.
At the end of 2005, interest rates were xed on approximately 61% of the projected net of cash and borrowing positions for 2006 and 49% for 2007 compared with 54% for 2005 and 36% for 2006 at the end of 2004.
From 1 January 2005, Unilever has adopted IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement which requires the recognition of derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value.
The derivative financial instruments as recognised in the balance sheet under trade and other receivables and trade payables and other liabilities are shown in the tables below.
The amounts shown in the tables as at 31 December 2004 are the fair values of the underlying derivatives at that date.
No restatements have been made to the income statement and balance sheet for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The separate amounts shown as assets and liabilities are not indicative of the amount of credit risk to which the Group is exposed as we have netting agreements in place with our principal banks.
In case of a default, Unilever is allowed to net the assets and liabilities.
There was no significant concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty.
For details of our policy for managing credit risk see note 2 on page 86.
In the assessment of hedge effectiveness the credit risk element on the underlying has been excluded.
Hedge ineffectiveness is immaterial, nothing has been booked to the income statement.
In the 2004 comparatives, prior to the adoption of IAS 39, derivative financial instruments were accounted for on the following basis.
Changes in the value of forward foreign exchange contracts were recognised in results in the same period as changes in the values of the assets and liabilities they were intended to hedge.
Interest payments and receipts arising from interest rate derivatives such as swaps and forward rate agreements were matched to those arising from underlying debt and investment positions.
Payments made or received in respect of the early termination of derivative financial instruments were spread over the original life of the instrument, so long as the underlying exposure continued to exist.
Further information about our prior year reporting of financial instruments is given at the end of this note.

For those derivatives for which cash ow hedge accounting has been applied, the unrealised changes in fair values are included in reserves.
If the cash ow hedge of a rm commitment or forecasted transaction subsequently results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedged items that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.

The fair values of interest rate derivatives are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash ows.
Embedded derivatives In accordance with IAS 39, 'Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement', Unilever has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet specic requirements set out in the standard.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2005 111 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 19 Financial instruments continued Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table summarises the fair values and carrying amounts of the various classes of financial assets and financial liabilities.
All trade and other receivables and trade payables and other liabilities other than finance lease creditors and provisions have been excluded from the analysis below and from the interest rate and currency proles in note 17 on page 106 and note 18 on page 109, as their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of their fair value.

Cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets, bank loans and overdrafts have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts because of their short-term nature.
The fair values of listed bonds are based on their market value, non-listed bonds and other loans are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash ows associated with these instruments.
Fair value for finance lease creditors have been assessed by reference to current market rates for comparable leasing arrangements.
Collateral In November 2001, NV entered into a forward purchase contract with a counterparty bank to buy 10 000 000 PLC shares at 559p per share in November 2006.
Depending on the market value of this forward purchase contract, a cash collateral at a minimum of 8 million must be placed with the counterparty bank.
At 31 December 2005 16 million 2004: 24 million was so deposited.
At 31 December 2005 the market value of the forward purchase contract was 7 million 2004: 14 million.
Counterparties have deposited securities with a market value of 275 million 2004: 589 million as collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments.
Such collateral is not regarded as an asset of Unilever and is excluded from the balance sheet.
Currency exposures Unilevers foreign exchange policies are described in note 2 on page 86.
These policies require operating companies to manage trading and financial exposures within prescribed limits.
At the end of 2005, there was no material exposure from companies holding assets and liabilities other than in their functional currency.
Commodity contracts Unilever purchases forward contracts to hedge future requirements for certain raw materials, almost always for physical delivery.
Futures contracts may also be used to hedge future price movements, however the amounts are not material.
For further details please refer to page 32.
Additional disclosures relating to 2004 As noted on page 110, 2004 gures in this note are presented under the accounting policies which applied prior to the adoption of IAS 39.
The following additional disclosures relate to the presentation of amounts for 2004.
Nominal values of interest rate derivatives and cross currency swaps are shown in the table below.
These nominal values do not reect the actual level of use of financial instruments when compared with the nominal value of the underlying debt.
This is because certain financial instruments have consecutive strike and maturity dates on the same underlying debt in different time periods.
Whilst the nominal amounts reect the volume of activity, they are not indicative of the amount of credit risk to which the Group is exposed.
