18 Business combinations 2005 acquisitions The Group has made a number of acquisitions in the year of which only one, the acquisition of the BDML group of companies BDML, is considered material and is thus disclosed separately.
The remainder are shown in aggregate.
The book and fair values of the assets acquired are disclosed in the tables below.
Fair value to Book values Fair value Group BDML m m m Intangible assets 12.9 12.9 Property, plant and equipment 0.8 0.1 0.7 Deferred tax 1.0 1.0 Debtors 38.0 38.0 Cash and short term deposits 0.3 0.3 Creditors 40.3 0.3 40.6 Corporation tax 0.3 0.3 Net assets 0.1 12.5 12.6 Goodwill arising on acquisition 13.4 26.0 Discharged by: Cash 25.7 Associated costs settled in cash 0.3 26.0 BDML, includes BDML Connect Limited an insurance intermediary and agent that offers instalment debt facilities to its insurance customers and a specialist in pet insurance and policy administration.
The Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of BDML on the 25 July 2005.
From the date of acquisition BDML has contributed 1.1m to the net profit after tax of the Group, had the combination taken place at the beginning of the year the profit after tax of the Group would have been 107.9m and the revenue from continuing operations would have been 1,443.7m.
Included within goodwill on acquisition are certain intangibles that were not separable from the acquiree and could not be measured, these include customer loyalty and the assembled workforce.
The acquisition of BDML includes insurance debtors subject to a securitisation agreement.
The purpose of this arrangement is to securitise customer receivables, derived through the provision of instalment credit facilities to insurance customers of the company.
The company sells said receivables, with no immediate effect on the P&L, for cash to a third party Gresham in this case.
Gresham take on the rights and responsibilites of these receivables such that the terms of this agreement dictate that Gresham has no recourse to BDML beyond 14% of the total receivable securitised.
Under UK GAAP, the substance of this arrangement was disclosed as linked presentation under the current assets section of the balance sheet, without appearing in the nancing section of the balance sheet.
The Groups transition to IFRS has necessitated different disclosure, the impact of which is to reect on BDMLs opening balance sheet an increase in the Groups receivables of 37.1m adding 26.8m of securitised asset nancing.
The respective balances of this arrangement at 31 December 2005 were 37.9m to receivables and 28.2m to securitised asset nancing.

The other acquisitions in the year include Buchanan Consulting Engineers Limited, BMI Health Services Limited, Channel House Financial Services Group Limited, FPS Group of Companies Limited, Lonsdale Travel Limited, Quay Software Solutions Limited, Randall Lyons Limited, Micromedia Limited, MHA Pensions Limited and Norman Dawbarn.
The companies acquired provide a range of property, health, trust, pension, corporate travel and software services.
On 8 November 2005, 0.1 million ordinary 2p shares with an aggregate nominal value of 1,300 were issued at 3.89 each pursuant to the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking, Lonsdale Travel Limited.
The performance of these acquisitions post their inclusion in the Group cannot be ascertained as they have been fully integrated within existing offerings.
Within goodwill are certain intangibles that were not separable from the acquirees and could not be measured reliably.
These items include customer loyalty and the assembled workforce.
Included in the above table is further consideration paid in cash with regard to the acquisition of the Lincoln Life and Pensions business in a previous year of 13.8m against which the Group had provided for accrued deferred consideration payable of 6.6m.
There were also further payments on previous acquisitions.
The impact of these further payments is to increase goodwill by 9.4m.
In the comparative period the Group made acquisitions of value 52.1m of which 51.4m was settled by cash, 0.4m through the issue of loan notes and 0.3m by way of deferred consideration.
Net assets acquired amounted to 19.0m including intangible assets of 10.1m resulting in goodwill of 33.1m.
The resultant goodwill holds intangibles that were not separable from the acquiree and could not be reliably valued.
These include customer loyalty and the assembled workforce.
Further consideration was paid on acquisitions prior to 2004 which amounted to 5.0m.

The audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2003 show a profit on ordinary activities after taxation of 1.8m.
The subsidiary has been merged within the existing property operations of the Group but its profitability is visible in that merged operation and so although the Group is able to disclose post acquisition performance of the acquisition it is not possible to determine post acquisition cash inows.
Capita Health Solutions formerly Aon Health Solutions on 8 April 2004 the Group acquired the occupational health business of Aon Health Solutions for a cash consideration of 2.7m.
The Group acquired debtors of 2.7m fair value 2.7m, and creditors, including taxation of 0.6m fair value 0.6m.
The pre-acquisition performance of the business is unavailable as the gures were not reported separately in the financial statements of the vendor.
