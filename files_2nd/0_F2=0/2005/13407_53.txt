Goodwill amortisation Under UK GAAP, goodwill was amortised over its useful economic life, not exceeding 20 years.
Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortised but tested annually for impairment.
For 2004 under IFRS, goodwill amortisation of 75m expensed under UK GAAP has been reversed.
Goodwill in reserves Under UK GAAP, goodwill previously written off directly to reserves was recycled to the consolidated income statement on disposal or impairment of the related business.
Under IFRS, goodwill previously written off directly to reserves is not recycled.
For 2004 under IFRS, goodwill previously written off directly to reserves and recycled to the consolidated income statement under UK GAAP of 11m on disposal of businesses and 8m on impairment have been reversed.
105 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 36 Reconciliation of the consolidated income statement for 2004 from UK GAAP to IFRS continued Share based payment Under UK GAAP, an expense was recognised in the consolidated income statement for share options, excluding save as you earn options which were exempt, based on intrinsic value.
Under IFRS, an expense is recognised for all equity settled share options granted after 7 November 2002 and for all cash settled share options, based on the fair value of the options calculated using appropriate pricing models.
For 2004 under IFRS, operating expenses increase by 2m.
Retirement benefit obligations Under UK GAAP, pension plan and retiree medical administration expenses were included as part of the current service cost of providing employee benefits and included in operating expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Under IFRS, pension plan and retiree medical administration expenses reduce the expected return on plan assets and are included in retirement benefit obligations net finance cost in the consolidated income statement.
For 2004 under IFRS, operating expenses reduce and retirement benefit obligations net finance cost increases by 6m for pension plan and retiree medical administration expenses.
Share of profits of associates Under UK GAAP, the group share of operating profits of associates was presented on the face of the consolidated income statement after group operating profit.
The group share of interest and tax of associates was included within the relevant group totals.
Under IFRS, the group share of profit after tax of associates is presented on the face of the consolidated income statement after group operating profit.
Under UK GAAP, an investment in an entity other than a subsidiary was treated as an associate if the group had a participating interest and exercised significant influence over its operating and financial policies.
Under IFRS, an investment in an entity is treated as an associate if the group has the power to exercise significant influence over its operating and financial policies.
For 2004 under IFRS, an interest charge of 1m and a tax charge of 3m have been reclassified to group share of profit after tax of associates.
In addition, a group investment was impaired by 1m and under IFRS this investment qualifies as an associate and consequently the impairment has been included as part of share of profit after tax of associates.
Deferred tax Under UK GAAP, the subsequent recognition of deferred tax assets not originally recognised at the time of an acquisition was recorded as a deferred tax asset and a tax credit in the consolidated income statement.
Under IFRS, subsequent recognition also gives rise to a reduction in goodwill and a corresponding operating expense in the consolidated income statement.
Under UK GAAP, deferred tax was only recognised on fair value adjustments resulting from acquisitions where they resulted in timing differences in the acquired entitys own financial statements.
Under IFRS, deferred tax is recognised on the difference between the fair value and the tax base of all assets and liabilities acquired in an acquisition.
Under UK GAAP, movements in deferred tax assets relating to equity settled share options were recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Under IFRS, movements in deferred tax assets relating to the cumulative remuneration expense of equity settled share options are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Any excess deferred tax movements are recognised directly in equity.
For 2004 under IFRS, due to the subsequent recognition of deferred tax assets not originally recognised at the time of an acquisition operating expenses increase by 9m.
In addition, the tax charge reduces by 1m resulting from a revaluation of property, plant and equipment on a 2004 acquisition and increases by 1m in respect of share options.
Acquisitions Under UK GAAP, fair value adjustments to assets and liabilities were permitted up to the end of the year following the year of the acquisition and recognised in the year when the adjustments were made.
Under IFRS, fair value adjustments to assets and liabilities are permitted up to one year following the acquisition and are recognised retrospectively in the financial statements.
For 2004 under IFRS, operating expenses increase by 1m arising from the retrospective recognition of fair value adjustments arising on 2003 acquisitions.
Other For 2004 under IFRS, other adjustments principally comprise a 2m increase in exceptional profit before tax and exceptional profit attributable to equity shareholders arising from the reclassification of certain employee benefit costs to the 1 January 2004 transition balance sheet of 4m, less 2m relating to the reclassification to the consolidated income statement of an impairment of assets following the transfer of an operation from associate to subsidiary status.
"Amendment to IAS21 ""The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates"" In December 2005, the IASB published an amendment to IAS21 clarifying that a loan between Group subsidiaries may form part of the Groups net investment in the subsidiary receiving the loan."
As a result, a foreign exchange gain of 3m for the year ended 31 December 2004 is now recognised in equity.
In the published 2005 interim consolidated financial statements, this gain was recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004.
