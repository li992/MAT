ANNUAL REVIEW CHAIRMANS STATEMENT GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW ABOUT THE FRIENDS PROVIDENT GROUP UK LIFE & PENSIONS Group Financial Performance Group profitability on the European Embedded Value EEV basis EEV BASIS Our results are presented on two bases: European Embedded Value EEV and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
EEV is the basis we find most useful because it provides a more representative reflection of the performance of long-term business that fully recognises the shareholders interest in the in-force portfolio.
Consequently most of our financial key performance indicators are defined in EEV rather than IFRS terms.

Philip Moore, Group Finance Director 30 Friends Provident Annual Report & Accounts 2005 INTERNATIONAL LIFE & PENSIONS ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK Group EEV underlying profit Group EEV underlying profit before tax has increased by 34% to 524 million 2004: 392m, with significant increases in profits from all three business 2005 34% 524m segments.
This is particularly noticeable in our Asset Management and 2004 392m International Life & Pensions businesses where the ISIS F&C merger and Lombard acquisition have made major contributions, but the results have also Group EEV profit before tax benefited from organic growth.
2005 60% 600m Group EEV profit before tax has increased by 60% to 600 million 2004: 375m.
2004 375m In addition to the above factors, this takes into account the good investment returns achieved during the year offset by the impacts of economic assumption changes, non-recurring and other items, which are discussed below.
Underlying profit by business segment Underlying profit The significant increases in the Asset Management and 2005 2004 International Life and Pensions underlying profits have led to an increase in their proportions of the Groups underlying profit excluding corporate items to 20% each 2004: 10% and 15% respectively.
Commentary on the segmental results is given on pages 17, 23 and 29.
Corporate items include: the expected return on the net pension liability of 2 million negative 2004: 8m positive, the expected return on corporate net assets of 2005 2004 7 million negative 2004: nil, corporate costs of 12 million 2004: 10m and operating UK Life & Pensions 60% 75% assumption changes for corporate costs of 3 million positive 2004: nil.
The negative International Life & Pensions 20% 15% expected return on corporate net assets arises because the interest payable on the 2003 Asset Management 20% 10% STICS exceeds the coupon receivable on the investment by the parent in FPLP preference shares.
Contribution from Life & Pensions The contribution from total Life & Pensions new business has increased by 85% to new business 144 million 2004: 78m.
The new business margin as a percentage of PVNBP has 2005 85% 144m increased slightly from 2.5% to 2.7% as a consequence of the mix changing in favour of higher margin International business, offsetting lower UK margins.
The proportion of 2004 78m new business profits arising from the International segment has increased from 26% to 55% reflecting the changing profile of the Group, following the Lombard acquisition in January 2005.
Life & Pensions return on embedded value The Life & Pensions return on embedded value has increased from 11.0% to 11.2% due mainly to the increased size of the International business as a result of the Lombard 2005 11.2% acquisition.
The higher International return reflects the much higher proportion of new business profit to embedded value compared with the UK business.
The other profit items excluded from underlying profit but included in profit before Other profit items tax are shown in the table on page 30.
The major items are: 2005 76m Strong stock market returns and growth in fixed interest market values during 2005 2004 -17m have generated a 550 million investment return variance 2004: 197m over and above the expected return.
The effect of changes in economic assumptions mainly a 0.5% reduction in the risk free rate of return has decreased profits by 238 million 2004: 128m.
Non-recurring items comprise: F&C integration costs of 24 million, F&C Reinvestment Plan costs of 22 million relating to the share schemes put in place at the time of the merger to lock in and incentivise senior staff, FPI integration costs of 6 million and a net mis-selling charge of 7 million.
The amortisation of Asset Management intangible assets of 56 million includes a first full years amortisation of F&C investment management contracts 2004: 21m.
An impairment review of the F&C investment management contracts resulted in a further write down of 112 million 2004: nil as described on page 29.
