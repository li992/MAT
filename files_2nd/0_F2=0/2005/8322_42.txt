Of the 161 million 2004: 166 million deferred tax asset in respect of tax losses, 102 million 2004: 109 million can be carried forward for a period of between 11 and 19 years.
The balance can be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax asset in relation to these losses has been recognised.
No additional valuation allowance 2004: 10 million has been made in the year.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures was 634 million 2004: 713 million.
Calculation of the potential deferred tax liability has not been undertaken as the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
If the temporary differences were to reverse in the future, it is probable that the majority of the potential tax liability would be covered by tax credits in respect of tax paid locally.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in accordance with the Group's accounting policy.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for balance sheet purposes.
