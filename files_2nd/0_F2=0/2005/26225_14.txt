measures, Individual Capital Assessment ICA measures capital using risk based techniques, and provides a measure of economic capital.
Available Regulatory Capital Resources Capital resources available to meet the UK capital requirements Basis of Regulatory Capital and Corresponding Regulatory are determined using FSA valuation rules.
The asset valuation rules Capital Requirements are based on UK Generally Accepted Accounting Policies, adjusted In each country in which the Group operates, the local insurance for both admissibility limits and specific valuation differences.
The regulator specifies rules and guidance for the minimum amount Groups regulatory capital position statement in Table 1 sets out the and type of capital which must be held by long term insurance different sources of capital held within the Group.
The Groups total subsidiaries in excess of their insurance liabilities.
The minimum available capital resources are 6,172m 2004: 5,363m of which required capital must be maintained at all times throughout the 4,607m 2004: 4,316m is held by the life businesses.
This helps to ensure that payments to policyholders can be held by the UK and overseas life businesses is generally constrained made as they fall due.
The Group has not breached any regulatory by local regulatory requirements.
This means it may not be possible capital requirements at any time during the year.
for this capital to be used to provide funding for other businesses.
The required capital is calculated by either assessing the The total available capital resources of the Groups with-profits additional assets which would be required to meet the insurance business 842m is determined in accordance with the realistic companys liabilities in specified, stressed financial conditions, or by balance sheet rules prescribed by the FSA.
The capital resources applying fixed percentages to the insurance companys liabilities reflect the surplus in that part of the fund that is in excess of any and risk exposures.

The liabilities within the in which the Group operates are detailed below: consolidated balance sheet do not include the amount representing the shareholders share of future bonuses.
However for capital UK regulatory basis reporting, the shareholders share is deducted from capital resources Required capital for the life business is based on the rules of the in the capital statement.
The Company must hold assets in excess of the higher of two At 31 December 2005, the realistic value of the UK participating amounts, the first being calculated using the FSA rules pillar 1, the liabilities was 20,338m 2004: 18,676m under the FSA realistic second being an economic capital assessment by the Company capital regime.
The excess of realistic assets over realistic liabilities which is reviewed by the FSA pillar 2. was 842m 2004: 864m.
The public pillar 1 capital calculation is the total of two amounts.
The first amount is based on the most onerous of a number of stress tests which are applied to both assets and insurance liabilities.
The second amount is calculated by applying fixed percentages to liabilities and sums assured at risk.
There are further stress tests for participating liabilities as measured in the Realistic Balance Sheet, which may increase the required capital.
The private pillar 2 capital calculation is an assessment of the economic capital required to ensure that the Company can meet its liabilities with a high likelihood as they fall due.
This is achieved by stochastic modelling and scenario testing.
The result is reviewed and may be modified by the FSA.
Regulatory capital for the general insurance business is also calculated using FSA pillar 1 and pillar 2 rules.
The pillar 1 calculation applies fixed percentages to premiums and claims.
US regulatory basis Required capital is determined to be the Company Action Level Risk Based Capital based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Risk Based Capital model RBC.
RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile.
The calculation is based on applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items, with the factors determined as higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items.
French and Dutch regulatory bases The minimum required capital is defined by the French Ministry of Finances Code des Assurances and the Pensioen & Verzekeringskamer Dutch Supervisory Body respectively.
The basis of the calculation is a percentage of the liabilities plus a percentage of the sum assured at risk and, for some contracts, the premium.
The percentages depend on the guarantees given and the amount of reinsurance cover.

MANAGEMENT OF CAPITAL RESOURCES continued Available Regulatory Capital Resource Sensitivities The Groups available capital resources are sensitive to changes in market conditions, due to both changes in the value of the assets and to the effect that changes in investment conditions may have on the value of the liabilities.
Capital resources are also sensitive to assumptions and experience relating to mortality and morbidity and, to a lesser extent, expenses and persistency.
The most significant sensitivities arise from the following four risks: Market risk in relation to UK participating business would crystallise if adverse changes in the value of the assets supporting this business could not be fully reflected in payments to policyholders because of the effect of guarantees and options.
The capital position of this business would also deteriorate if increases to the market cost of derivatives resulted in an increase in the liability for guarantees and options in the realistic balance sheet.
Market risk in relation to the UK annuity business, which would crystallise if the return from the fixed interest investments supporting this business were lower than that assumed for reserving.
Mortality risk in relation to the UK annuity business, which would crystallise if the mortality of annuitants improved more rapidly than the assumptions used for reserving.
Mortality risk in relation to the UK and US term assurance business, which would crystallise if mortality of the lives insured were higher than that assumed, possibly because of an epidemic.
A range of management actions is available to mitigate any adverse impact from changing market conditions and experience.
Examples of possible management actions available to mitigate such an effect include changes to with-profits bonus rates, changes to discretionary surrender terms and the potential for charging for guarantees.
To the extent that management actions are expected only to partially offset adverse experience, then liabilities would be increased to anticipate the future impact of the worse experience and total capital resources would be reduced.
Movements in Life Business Regulatory Capital Resources The movement in the Groups capital resources are shown in Table 2.

This type of analysis helps protect profits from changing interest rates.
Interest rate risk cannot be completely eliminated, due to the nature of the liabilities and early redemption options contained in the assets.
For businesses where a range of asset types, including equity and property, are held to meet liabilities, the Group uses stochastic models to assess the impact of a range of future return scenarios on investment values and associated liabilities.
This allows the Group to devise an investment and with-profits policyholder bonus strategy which optimises returns to its policyholders over time whilst limiting the capital requirements associated with these businesses.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL continued Other price risk Other price risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk.
These changes may be as a result of features of the individual instrument, its issuer or factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market.
The Group controls its exposure to geographic price risks by using internal country ratings.
These ratings are based on macroeconomic data and key qualitative indicators.
The latter take into account the economic, social and political environments.
Table 5 indicates the Groups exposure to different equity markets around the world.
Linked equity investments are excluded from the table as the risk is retained by the policyholder.

Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that the Group is exposed to loss if another party fails to perform its financial obligations to the Group.
Significant areas where the Group is exposed to credit risk are: The Group holds corporate bonds to back part of its insurance liabilities.
Significant exposures are managed by the application of concentration limits, with allowance being made in the actuarial valuation of the insurance liabilities for possible defaults.
The Group limits its exposure to insurance risk by ceding part of the risks it assumes to the reinsurance market.
To limit the risk of reinsurer default the Group operates a credit rating policy when arranging cover.
When selecting new reinsurance partners the Group considers only companies which have a minimum credit rating equivalent to A from Standard & Poors and imposes limits on the level of exposure to any individual reinsurer.
Aggregate counterparty exposures are regularly monitored both at an individual subsidiary level and on a Groupwide basis.

OPERATING PROFIT INFORMATION For UK long term insurance business, operating profit is the accrued distributable transfer from the UK Long Term Fund LTF to shareholders, grossed up at the corporate tax rate.
For non profit business, it is augmented by the interest paid on the intra-group subordinated debt capital included within the SRC.
Operating profit includes a longer term investment return on shareholders, general insurance and Netherlands funds held outside the UK LTF.
It excludes investment variances and the change in the SRC.
The income statement comprises returns to shareholders and excludes policyholders returns.
This supplementary information provides further analysis of the results reported under IFRS and we believe gives shareholders a better understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
In addition to the restatements described in Note 1, the 2004 comparatives for operating profit have also been adjusted for the following items: The Netherlands operating profit is affected by various mismatches between asset and liability valuations.
An adjustment to partially smooth the investment return uctuations has been made to the Netherlands operating profit.
This reduces the 2004 operating profit by 11m and increases the variation from longer term investment return by the same amount.
The results of Retail investments and Institutional fund management have been combined to create a new segment called Investment management.
The Retail investment operating profit of 4m in 2004 has been reclassied from Other operational income and included in Investment management.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The fair values of the share grants made during the year have been calculated using the following assumptions: SAYE SAYE PSP Award date 1 Apr 05 1 Sep 05 7 Apr 05 Weighted average share price 113p 112p 113p Weighted average exercise price 94p 90p n a Expected volatility 35.0% 35.0% n a Expected life 3 7 years 3 7 years 3 years Risk free investment rate 4.6% 4.1% n a Dividend yield 4.8% 4.6% 4.8% Expected volatility is a measure of the tendency of a security price to uctuate in a random, unpredictable manner.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous ten years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued The Group provides the following equity settled share-based long term incentive plans for directors and eligible employees: Savings-related Share Option Scheme SAYE The SAYE allows employees to enter into a regular savings contract over either three, five or seven years, coupled with a corresponding option over shares of the Group.
The grant price is equal to 80% of the quoted market price of the Group shares on the invitation date.
Options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.

The assumptions used in the model are shown on page 83.
The weighted average fair value of SAYE options granted during the year was 31p 2004: 28p.
The Group recognised total expenses of 2m 2004: 2m related to the SAYE scheme.
The intrinsic value of vested SAYE options was nil 2004: nil at the year end.
Intrinsic value of a share option is calculated as the current share price less the option price.
Company Share Option Plan CSOP Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The CSOP, approved by HM Revenue & Customs, and unapproved ESOS schemes were designed to provide a long term incentive to directors and managers of the Group.
The number of options granted is based on the managers level, salary and performance.
The options have a ten year life but do not normally vest in the first three years.
In order to exercise the options, the Legal & General Total Shareholder Return TSR must exceed the median TSR of the FTSE 100 for a period of at least three years commencing on the date of the grant.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued Share Bonus Plan SBP SBP awards granted before 2005 gave the recipient the right to receive a xed number of shares three years after the grant date.
SBP grants in 2005 awarded restricted shares which vest with employees three years after the grant date.
The 2005 share grant recipients are entitled to both vote and receive dividends.
In both cases the rights associated with SBP grants are normally forfeited on leaving the Group.
The fair value of the shares awarded has been calculated as the market value on the grant date.
For pre-2005 awards, this has been adjusted by the estimated present value of future dividends to which the holder is not entitled.
During the year, 6,080,335 shares 2004: 6,127,568 shares were awarded under the SBP scheme.
The weighted average fair value of the shares issued was 113p 2004: 81p.
The Group recognised a total expense of 4m 2004: 2m relating to the SBP scheme.
Performance Share Plan PSP Conditional shares can be granted to top managers under the PSP, based upon individual and Company performance.
Under the PSP, the number of performance shares transferred to the individual at the end of the three year vesting period is dependant on Legal & Generals Total Shareholder Return TSR compared with that of the other FTSE 100 companies at the date of the award, measured over the vesting period.
The minimum number of performance shares is transferred if the TSR is at median.
The number increases proportionately to a maximum of four times the performance shares at or above twentieth position.
The fair value of the granted performance shares has been calculated using a probabilistic model that incorporates the market-based performance conditions within the scheme.
During the year, 2,184,481 2004: 1,750,000 performance shares were awarded.
The weighted average fair value of each award issued was 220p 2004: 183p.
The Group recognised a total expense of 3m 2004: 1m relating to the PSP scheme during the year.
Employee Share Plan ESP Under the ESP, approved by HM Revenue & Customs, permanent UK employees may elect to purchase Group shares from the market at the prevailing market price on a monthly basis.
The Group supplements the number of shares purchased by matching the first 20 of the employees contributions.
From time to time, the Group may make a grant of free shares.
Both the free and matching shares must be held in trust for three years before they may vest to the employee.
After vesting the shares remain within the trust until they are transferred to the employee or the employee leaves the Group.
The Trust is consolidated into the results of the Group with the unvested shares disclosed as treasury shares.
The fair value of the granted shares is equal to the market value at the grant date.
During the year, 3,959,530 shares 2004: 3,983,343 shares were granted under the ESP.
The weighted average fair value of the shares issued was 113p 2004: 98p.
The Group recognised a total expense of 3m 2004: 2m relating to the ESP scheme during the year.
Total Recognised Expense The total recognised expense relating to share based payments in 2005 was 13m 2004: 8m of which 13m 2004: 8m related to equity settled share schemes.

The notional amounts of some derivative instruments provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the balance sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash ows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Groups exposure to credit or price risks.
Net Investment Hedges Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts The Group hedges part of the foreign exchange translation exposure on its net investment in its overseas subsidiaries, using forward foreign exchange contracts, and designates movements in spot rates as part of the hedging relationship.
It recognises the portion of the gain or loss which is determined to be an effective hedge through reserves within shareholders equity along with the gain or loss on revaluation of the foreign subsidiaries.
Fair Value Hedges Interest Rate Swap Contracts The Group uses interest rate swap contracts as hedges of xed rate loans in particular as hedges of movements in the fair value of a loan due to interest rates.
Cash Flow Hedges Interest Rate Swap Contracts The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge the variability of future interest payments on certain oating rate financial instruments.
Hedge accounting defers the recognition of gains and losses on the hedging instrument until the cash ow being hedged appears in the income statement.
Derivative Contracts Held for Trading The Group uses certain derivative contracts which are effective hedges of economic exposures but are not designated within a formal hedge accounting relationship.
Gains and losses on these contracts are recognised immediately in the income statement.

The Group tries to balance past experience and future conditions by making prudent assumptions about the future long term average persistency levels.
For non profit contracts this prudence is also incorporated into the liabilities by ensuring that they are sufficient to cover the more onerous of the two scenarios where the policies either remain in force until maturity or where they discontinue at the valuation date.

The proceeds were swapped into sterling and will be used to repay part of the convertible bond which matures in 2006.
The notes are callable on 8 June 2015 and each year thereafter.
If not called, the coupon from 8 June 2015 will reset to a oating rate of interest based on prevailing three month Euribor plus 1.7% pa.
In March 2004 Legal & General Group Plc issued 400m of 5.875% undated subordinated notes.
These notes are callable on 1 April 2019 and every five years thereafter.
If not called, the coupon from 1 April 2019 will be reset to the prevailing five year benchmark gilt yield plus 2.33% pa.
Coupon payments on both subordinated issues may be deferred if no dividend is paid on the Groups ordinary shares.
The undated subordinated notes have been classied as equity because their perpetual nature means that in certain circumstances, interest can be deferred indefinitely.
The Euro dated subordinated notes are treated as lower tier II capital for regulatory purposes and the sterling undated subordinated notes as upper tier II capital.

The facility also has two one year extension options at the end of the first two years.
The maturity prole above is calculated on the basis that a facility to renance a maturing loan is not recognised unless the facility and loan are related.
If renancing under the Groups syndicated facility was recognised, then all amounts shown as repayable within one year would be reclassied as repayable between one and five years.
The effective interest rate is the rate which discounts exactly future cash payments over the life of the borrowing and will include all transaction costs and premium or discount on issue.

BORROWINGS continued Convertible Bonds In December 2001, the Company issued 525m of convertible bonds due in 2006 which generated net proceeds after expenses of 515m.
A coupon of 2.75% is paid semi-annually and the bonds convert into ordinary shares of the Company at a conversion price of 184p per share.
The convertible bonds could have been redeemed at the option of the Company, at par, provided the price of the ordinary shares of the Company exceeded 120% of the conversion price.
The bonds would, if converted, give rise to the issue of 285,326,086 new ordinary shares representing approximately 4.4% of the current issued ordinary share capital.
On conversion, the bonds may be settled in shares or in cash at the option of the Company.
The debt component, net of expenses, of the convertible bond recognised in the balance sheet is calculated as follows: 2005 2004 m m At 1 January 493 478 Interest expense 30 29 Coupons paid 14 14 At 31 December 509 493 The fair value of the debt component of the convertible bond at 31 December 2005 amounted to 517m 2004: 505m.
Interest expense on the bond is calculated using the effective interest rate of 5.7% on the debt component.
EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE On 13 March 2006 Legal & General Group Plc entered into a supplementary trust deed in respect of the 400m undated subordinated notes issued in March 2004.
Under the terms of this deed, if regulations change so that the notes no longer qualify to be included in the Groups regulatory capital, the Group cannot exercise its discretion to defer interest.
This has had the effect of changing the classication of the notes from equity to liability and coupon payments on the notes from distributions to interest in 2006.

DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES continued No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the Group is able to control the remittance of earnings to the UK and there is no intention to remit any such earnings to the UK in the foreseeable future if the remittance would trigger any incremental UK tax liability.
The maximum estimated temporary differences unprovided for are set out below grouped by country.
The calculation of the maximum temporary difference takes no account of any foreign tax suffered on the earnings in the jurisdiction of the foreign entity which may be available by way of double tax relief to reduce any UK tax liability arising on remittance.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS There were no material transactions between directors or key managers and the Legal & General group of companies.
All transactions between the Group, its directors and key managers are on commercial terms which are no more favourable than those available to staff in general.
Contributions to the post-employment benefit plans are outlined in Note 42.
The dened benefit pension scheme has purchased annuity contracts issued by Society for consideration of 37m 2004: 27m during the year, priced on an arms length basis.
At 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004 there were no loans outstanding to ofcers of the Company.
Key Management Personnel Compensation The aggregate compensation for key management personnel, including executive and non-executive directors, is as follows: 2005 2004 m m Wages and salaries 14 12 Social security costs 2 1 Post-employment benets 4 14 Share-based incentive awards 4 2 Key management personnel compensation 24 29 Number of key management personnel 57 54 Post-employment benets have been determined as the change in the transfer value of the pension benets from the previous year end.
As at 30 November 2004 a new actuarial basis was introduced for cash equivalent transfer values under the dened benefit pension scheme.
This used a new mortality table and a revised approach to the financial assumptions.
The effect was a substantial increase in values as at that date.
Since then the basis has only been changed in respect of regular adjustments to the financial assumptions, in line with movements in the bond markets.
The Groups investment portfolio includes investments in venture capital, property and financial investments which are held via collective investment vehicles.
Net investments into associate investment vehicles totalled 375m during the year 2004: 253m.
The Group has outstanding loans to these associates of 12m 2004: 11m and received investment management fees of 25m during the year 2004: 21m.
Distributions from these investment vehicles to the Group totalled 88m 2004: 173m.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, GUARANTEES AND INDEMNITIES Provision for the liabilities arising under contracts with policyholders is based on certain assumptions.
The variance of actual experience from that assumed may result in such liabilities differing from the provisions made for them.
Liabilities may also arise in respect of claims relating to the interpretation of such contracts, or the circumstances in which policyholders have entered into them together in this paragraph liabilities.
The extent of such liabilities is inuenced by a number of factors including the actions and requirements of the FSA, by ombudsman rulings, by industry compensation schemes and by court judgements.
The continuing general prole and emphasis being given by the FSA and other bodies to the suitability of the past sales of endowment policies in the context of some mortgage transactions has led to the continuing receipt of claims from holders of endowment policies.
Provision for liabilities continues to be made and is regularly reviewed.
However, it is not possible to predict, with certainty, the extent and the timing of the financial impact to which these liabilities may give rise.
The relevant members of the Group nevertheless consider that each makes prudent provision for such liabilities, as and when circumstances calling for such provision become clear, and that each has adequate capital and reserves to meet all reasonably foreseeable eventualities.
In 1975 the Society was required by the Institute of London Underwriters ILU to execute the ILU form of guarantee in respect of policies issued through the ILUs Policy Signing Ofce on behalf of NRG Victory Reinsurance Company Limited Victory, a company which was then a subsidiary of the Society.
In 1990, Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep Holding NV the assets and liabilities of which have since been assumed by Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV under a statutory merger in the Netherlands acquired Victory and provided an indemnity to the Society against any liability the Society may have as a result of the ILUs requirement, and the ILU agreed that its requirement of the Society would not apply to policies written or renewed after the acquisition.
Whether Society has any liability as a result of the ILUs requirement and, if so, the amount of its potential liability is uncertain.
Society has made no payment or provision in respect of this matter.
Group companies have given indemnities and guarantees, including interest rate guarantees, as a normal part of their operating activities or in relation to capital market transactions.
