The hedges were entered into for varying future periods, and in 2004 were recognised in the consolidated financial statements when the underlying exposure which they hedged was recognised.
The movements in the year end position as at 31 December 2004 on such hedges are set out above and relate to the following: interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and forward aluminium commodity contracts.
At 31 December 2004, a 101m gain in respect of cross currency swaps, entered into as net investment hedges, was carried forward in the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the Groups 2004 accounting policy on cross currency swaps.
Consequently the gains or losses on these swaps were recognised in equity and not in the consolidated income statement.
In addition to the above, there were 3m of deferred losses held on the consolidated balance sheet which were expected to be recognised in the consolidated income statement in 2005. vi Undrawn committed borrowing facilities Principal committed Facilities facilities available m m Remaining term at 31 December 2004: In more than four years but not more than five years 875 591 Facilities available were that part of the principal committed facility which was not drawn at 31 December 2004.
