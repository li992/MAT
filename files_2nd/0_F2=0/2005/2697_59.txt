IFRIC 4 is effective for periods beginning 1 March 2006.
The Group does not currently expect IFRIC 7 to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In December 2005, IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates was amended.
The amendment clarifies that a subsidiary can be a foreign operation in relation to the accounting for net investments in foreign operations.
The amendment also changes the classification of the foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary items forming part of an entitys net investment in a foreign operation where such an item is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of either the reporting entity or foreign operation.
Such foreign exchange gains and losses are now reflected in the separate component of equity in the financial statements, whereas previously they were not reclassified.
The impact of the standard will depend on future movements in foreign exchange rates however had the amendment been in place in 2005 there would have been no material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006.
Approval of financial statements The financial statements were approved by the board of directors and authorised for issue on 13 March 2006.
