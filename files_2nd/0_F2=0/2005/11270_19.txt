The policy is to ensure that forecast net borrowings plus reasonable operating headroom are covered by committed facilities which mature at least 12 months after the year end.
At the year end 180.0m 2004: 190.0m remained undrawn on the revolving credit facility.

Interest rate risk The group manages its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings by operating with a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings.
The objective is to operate with fixed rate borrowings within a range of 20 to 50 per cent of total borrowings over the medium term, although the group may operate outside that range during the year.
The groups fixed rate debt is based principally on the 91.3m 6.75 per cent convertible subordinated bonds 2008 detailed in note 21.

62 Notes to the accounts Northern Foods plc 26 Pensions The pension costs principally relate to the Northern Foods Pension Scheme the Scheme which is a defined benefit scheme providing members with benefits based on pay and service.
The assets of the Scheme are held in trustee administered funds separate from the finances of the group.
The group also operates a number of other schemes, none of which are considered to be material.
In March 2005 the company announced the closure of the Scheme and removed all remaining company-funded early retirement provisions.
Pension Builder was introduced for new employees, and is a defined benefit scheme based on a career average principle.
SSAP 24 The pension costs relating to the Scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary, Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow, using the projected unit method.
For the purposes of determining pension costs the most significant assumptions adopted were as follows: Rate of increase in pensionable earnings 3.9 per cent per annum Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.8 per cent per annum Rate of investment return 7.3 per cent per annum The most recent actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2002 using a market-based approach.
The market value of the Schemes assets was 449.9m which represented 95 per cent of the value of accrued benefits allowing for assumed future increases in earnings on the basis of the assumptions adopted for that valuation.
As required by SSAP 24, the figures included in the accounts in respect of the groups pension schemes are based on actuarial valuations carried out at 31 March 2002.
This does not take into account any impact of the fall in general stock markets since that date.
Any such impact will be reflected in the next triennial valuation, based upon which subsequent pension costs will be determined.
The contribution rate for the year was 12.7 per cent of pensionable earnings.
In addition the company made a special contribution of 20.0m during the year.
FRS 17 Additional disclosures regarding the groups defined benefit scheme are required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17.
The actuarial valuation described above has been updated at the year end by an independent qualified actuary, Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow, using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of FRS 17.
Investments have been valued for this purpose at fair value.
For the purposes of determining the Scheme liabilities under FRS 17 the most significant assumptions adopted were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 % %% Rate of increase of salaries 3.7 3.9 3.6 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.6 2.8 2.5 Rate of increase to deferred pensions 3.0 3.0 3.0 Discount rate 5.4 5.5 5.9 Inflation assumption 2.7 2.9 2.6 The fair value of the assets in the Scheme, together with those of the overseas scheme, the present value of the liabilities and the expected rate of return as at the year ends 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Long term Long term Long term expected rate expected rate expected rate of return 2005 of return 2004 of return 2003 %m %m %m Equities 8.3 428.2 8.3 374.4 8.3 264.7 Bonds 5.0 129.7 5.0 103.0 5.0 103.7 Other 4.0 6.2 4.0 6.0 4.0 29.0 Total fair value of assets 564.1 483.4 397.4 Present value of scheme liabilities 729.3 705.1 600.9 Deficit in scheme 165.2 221.7 203.5 Related deferred tax asset 48.6 66.0 60.0 Net pension deficit 116.6 155.7 143.5 Northern Foods plc Notes to the accounts 63 Notes to the accounts continued 26 Pensions continued If the group had adopted FRS 17, the groups profit and loss account reserve would have been restated as follows: 2005 2004 m m Group profit and loss account reserve excluding pension deficit 141.0 149.6 Net pension deficit 116.6 155.7 SSAP 24 prepayment 95.2 61.3 Deferred tax on SSAP 24 prepayment 28.6 18.4 Group profit and loss account reserve 42.2 49.0 The amounts charged to operating profit under FRS 17 would have been as follows: 2005 2004 m m Current service cost 21.9 18.7 Net operating charge 21.9 18.7 The amounts charged credited to net finance charge under FRS 17 would have been as follows: 2005 2004 m m Expected return on pension scheme assets 36.8 28.3 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 39.0 34.8 Net finance charge 2.2 6.5 The amounts included within the groups statement of total recognised gains and losses under FRS 17 would have been as follows: 2005 2004 m m Difference between actual and expected return on scheme assets 14.2 51.9 Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities 0.7 0.5 Effects of changes in assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities 24.5 74.5 Total actuarial gains and losses recognised in the groups statement of total recognised gains and losses 38.0 22.1 Deferred tax movement 11.9 6.6 Total actuarial gains and losses recognised in the groups statement of total recognised gains and losses net of deferred tax 26.1 15.5 The movement in deficit during the year under FRS 17 would have been as follows: 2005 2004 m m Deficit in scheme at start of year 221.7 203.5 Movement in year: Disposal of scheme 4.3 Current service cost 21.9 18.7 Contributions 42.7 24.7 Net finance charge 2.2 6.5 Exchange adjustments 0.1 0.1 Actuarial gain loss 38.0 22.1 Deficit in scheme at end of year 165.2 221.7 Related deferred tax asset 48.6 66.0 Net pension deficit at end of year 116.6 155.7 64 Notes to the accounts Northern Foods plc 26 Pensions continued The experience gains and losses under FRS 17 would have been as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets: Amount m 14.2 51.9 127.9 Percentage of scheme assets % 2.5 10.7 32.2 Experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities: Amount m 0.7 0.5 7.0 Percentage of the present value of scheme liabilities % 0.1 0.1 1.2 Total actuarial gains and losses recognised in the groups statement of total recognised gains and losses: Amount m 38.0 22.1 143.9 Percentage of the present value of scheme liabilities % 5.2 3.1 23.9 27 Financial commitments Capital expenditure authorised by the directors and to which the group and the company are contracted amounted to 16.7m and nil respectively 2004: 4.7m and nil respectively.
