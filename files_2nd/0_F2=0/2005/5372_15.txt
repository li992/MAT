3 Non-statutory disclosures normalised results Normalised results are presented to provide a better indication of overall financial performance and to reflect how the business is managed on a day-to-day basis.
The normalised results exclude the amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible fixed assets, any profit or loss on the disposal or closure of businesses and fixed asset investments, other exceptional items including exceptional reorganisation costs, financing costs and the tax impact of all these items.
A reconciliation of Group operating profit to normalised Group operating profit is provided below, as is a reconciliation of profit on ordinary activities before tax to normalised profit on ordinary activities before tax.
There is no difference between statutory and normalised turnover.

No loans have been made by any scheme to any Group company and no shareholdings of the schemes have been used as security for any loans to any Group company.
i Defined contribution plan Flexiplan The pension charge for Flexiplan represents contributions due from the employer.
During the year it amounted to 4.5m 2004: 4.7m with 0.3m 2004: 0.4m outstanding at the year end.
ii Defined benefit plan Emap Earnings Related Pension Plan EERPP The pension charge for the year for all schemes, including France, was 3.6m 2004: 3.5m.
Contributions are assessed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method and are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of the EERPP over the estimated remaining service lives of staff within the Group.
The balance sheet contains a prepayment amounting to 6.4m 2004: 5.3m.
The pension cost for the plan is assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
For these purposes, a valuation of the EERPP was carried out as at 5 April 2003 using the projected unit method.
In this valuation the assets were taken in at their market value of 66.6m.
A value was placed on the liabilities by discounting the anticipated future benefits, including allowances for future increases in plan pay and pensions in payment, using assumptions derived by reference to market conditions as at 5 April 2003.
The principal assumptions adopted were that existing investments would return 3.8% per annum in real terms ahead of price inflation assumed to be 2.6% per annum.
Furthermore, it was assumed that plan pay increases would exceed inflation by 1.5% per annum and that Limited Price indexation increases awarded to pensions in payment would on average follow the rate of inflation.
The valuation for funding purposes, undertaken at 5 April 2003, found that the assets were sufficient to cover 64% of the plans liabilities.
With effect from 5 April 2003, employer contributions of 4.2m per year are being paid to the plan along with contributions of 19.5% of Plan Pay reduced from 21.4% of Plan Pay from 1 February 2004. emap plc annual report & accounts 2005 60 7 Staff and their pay and benefits continued c Retirement benefits continued iii FRS 17 disclosures Whilst SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs disclosure and measurement principles have been applied to pensions in these financial statements, the tables below set out the transitional disclosures required by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits for the current year in relation to the Emap Earnings Related Pension Plan EERPP and other overseas retirement arrangements.
All calculations have been made by a qualified independent actuary based on the most recent full actuarial valuation of the EERPP as at 5 April 2003, updated to 31 March 2005.

In calculating profit into cash, operating cash flow, net of capital expenditure, is adjusted to exclude expenditure against exceptional reorganisation and acquisition restructuring provisions.
It is then compared to normalised Group operating profit.

14 Treasury information A discussion of the Groups treasury management policies can be found in the Operating and Financial Review on page 10.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the following disclosures.
a Borrowing facilities The Groups borrowing limit at 31 March 2005 calculated in accordance with the Articles of Association was 1,753m 2004: 1,625m.
In August 2004 the Groups revolving credit facility was refinanced and the maturity extended.
At 31 March 2005, the Group had a 500m syndicated multi-currency revolving credit facility which matures in August 2009 2004: 525m maturing in May 2006.
Under the 500m facility available at 31 March 2005, the Group had undrawn committed amounts of 480m 2004: 500m.
The Group also has short-term uncommitted credit facilities.
All these facilities bear margins at market rates.
b Currency exposures The table below shows the extent to which Group companies had net monetary assets liabilities in currencies other than their functional currency at 31 March 2005 and 2004.
Net foreign exchange gains and losses arising on these assets liabilities are recognised in the profit and loss account of the individual companies and the Group.

i Borrowings The maturity profile of borrowings is shown in Note 23.
The currency and interest rate profile of the Groups borrowings, taking into account the effect of interest rate and foreign exchange swaps, is as follows: Fixed rate borrowings NonWeighted average: Floating Fixed interest Interest Fixed 1 2 3 rate rate bearing Total rate period Note m m m m % Years Sterling 57 3 54 Euros 125 123 248 5.4 1.0 At 31 March 2005 182 123 3 302 Bank loans 45 1 44 2 Sterling Eurobond and related swaps 124 123 2 245 Amounts owed to associated undertakings 32 13 13 At 31 March 2005 182 123 3 302 Sterling 125 4 121 Euros 32 153 185 5.3 1.8 At 31 March 2004 157 153 4 306 Bank loans 52 2 50 Sterling Eurobond and related swaps 90 153 2 241 Loan notes 44 Amounts owed to associated undertakings 11 11 At 31 March 2004 157 153 4 306 1 Bank loans and amounts owed to associated undertakings bear interest at rates fixed in advance for periods of up to six months by reference to LIBOR.
2 The Sterling Eurobond has been swapped into floating rates of interest until its maturity in 2013.
A proportion of this floating rate debt has been swapped into Euro using foreign exchange swaps and a proportion of the resulting Euro floating rate debt has been swapped to a fixed rate of interest using interest rate swaps until March 2006.
3 Non-interest bearing borrowings comprise unamortised arrangement fees.
Arrangement fees are amortised and evenly charged in the Consolidated profit and loss account over the expected term of the revolving credit facility expiring in August 2009 and the Sterling Eurobond maturing in 2013. emap plc annual report & accounts 2005 66 14 Treasury information continued d Financial liabilities continued ii Onerous operating leases Property provisions of 4m at 31 March 2005 relate to onerous operating lease commitments: see Note 24 a.
Of these leases, 1m falls due within one year, 2m between two and five years and 1m after more than five years.
These financial liabilities are considered to be floating rate financial liabilities.
This is because, in establishing the provisions, the cash flows have been discounted and the discount rate is re-appraised at each half yearly reporting date to ensure that it reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
e Fair value of financial instruments The table below provides a comparison of the carrying values and fair values of the Groups financial assets liabilities.
Where available, third party market values have been used to determine fair values.
Otherwise, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
At 31 March 2005 At 31 March 2004 Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value m m m m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations Cash 38 38 38 38 Short-term borrowings 35 35 34 34 Long-term borrowings 267 278 272 281 264 275 268 277 Derivative instruments held to manage the interest rate and currency profile Foreign exchange swaps 31 7 7 Interest rate swaps 11 20 3 10 7 13 All the derivative financial instruments are used for hedging purposes.
As a result, any change in the value of the hedge will generally be offset by a change in the value of the underlying asset or liability.
f Hedges The table below shows the extent to which the Group has unrecognised or off balance sheet gains losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges, most of which comprise interest rate swaps.
All gains losses arising on these hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses gains on the underlying assets or liabilities.

The impairment charge, primarily in France, relates mainly to the TV listings business and Biba and 20 Ans, titles acquired from Excelsior in 2004.
Valuations have been measured by reference to the greater of net realisable value or value in use.
Value in use has been calculated with reference to future expected pre-tax cash flows, discounted at a rate of 13.0%, the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.

Other provisions relate to a provision for employers National Insurance Contributions in respect of Executive share schemes and the Groups share of net liabilities of joint ventures and associated undertakings.
During the year, we have reviewed the provisional fair value exercise performed on last years acquisition of Excelsior Publications SA Excelsior.
This has resulted in an adjustment of 2m to other provisions, resulting from a reduced deficit on the Companys funding of pension obligations.
This release has been offset against goodwill arising on the acquisition of Excelsior and has not impacted the profit and loss account.
The provisions arising during the year relate to the acquisition of Cannes Lions.
These relate to an onerous empty property lease, redundancy and other sundry integration costs.

27 Acquisitions On 6 August 2004 Emap Communications completed the acquisition of one of the worlds largest advertising festivals, Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival Cannes Lions.
Advertising Film Festival Financing Ltd was acquired from WJB Chiltern Trust Company Jersey Ltd for a purchase price of 82m, including 31m of cash within the company, giving a net purchase price of 51m.
On 5 May 2004 Emap Communications completed, for 14m cash consideration and costs of 1m, the acquisition of ABI Building Data Limited ABI, from ICW Publications Limited, part of the Springer Science and Business Media group owned by Cinven and Candover.
On 1 July 2004, the acquisition was referred to the Competition Commission by the Office of Fair Trading.
On 11 November 2004, the Competition Commission published its provisional findings report, and concluded that the merger may be expected to result in a Substantial Lessening of Competition in the market for the supply of Project Information and Contact Data.
From this date, we ceased consolidating the results of ABI, and have accounted for it as an associated undertaking.
This resulted in a transfer of goodwill of 15m from subsidiary undertakings to investments in associated undertakings see Notes 15 and 17.
In January 2005, the Competition Commission confirmed its provisional findings and as a result of this ruling, Emap agreed to dispose of this business.
On 10 May 2005 Emap Communications announced the sale of ABI to United Business Media plc see Note 33 resulting in a provision for a loss on disposal of the investment by 4m to reflect the sales proceeds of 12m and costs of disposal of 1m.
A provisional fair value exercise was performed on the acquired balance sheets of Cannes Lions and ABI, resulting in a 1m adjustment primarily in respect of the write off of previously capitalised web development costs, which have been expensed in accordance with Emaps accounting policies.
In addition, post acquisition reorganisation costs of 2m have now been expensed since the acquisitions, 1m in respect of property and 1m relating to restructuring.
On 7 July 2004 Emap Communications completed the purchase of the remaining 50% shareholding of the Interbuild exhibition from Montgomery Exhibitions Limited for a cash consideration of 1m.
Other small acquisitions by Emap Communications during the year amounted to 1m cash consideration: these include National House Building Awards and CareExpo Exhibition.
The impact of all acquisitions on the Consolidated balance sheet was as follows: Provisional Provisional Net book fair value fair value values adjustment to Group Note m m m Fixed assets 1 1 Current assets 3 3 Current liabilities 6 6 Cash and overdrafts 31 31 Fair value of assets acquired 29 1 28 Goodwill 15 71 Fair value of consideration 99 Comprising: Cash paid during the year 98 Related costs of acquisition 1 28 Business disposals and closures The 6m loss on business disposals and closures 2004: profit of 1m includes a provision for the loss on disposal of ABI Building Data Ltd see Note 27.
The remaining balance includes the loss on disposal and costs related to the closure of various activities across Emap France, Emap Communications and Emap Consumer Media.
To the extent that employers National Insurance Contributions are not payable these options will lapse.
