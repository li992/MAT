The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances for balance sheet purposes: 2005 2004 m m Deferred tax assets 123 17 Deferred tax liabilities 954 895 831 878 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 176 million 2004: 136 million available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 11 million 2004: 21 million of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 165 million 2004: 115 million as we do not believe that it is more likely than not that these amounts will be recoverable.
Tax losses of 15 million expire in 2006 and 2007, 94 million expire between 2008 and 2017 and 7 million expire after 2017.
Other tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 4.7 billion 2004: 3.9 billion.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and jointly controlled entities are insignificant.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group has various pension schemes throughout the world and these cover a significant proportion of the current employees.
The principal schemes are of the funded defined benefit type, with benefits accruing based on salary and length of service.
The schemes assets are held in external funds administered by trustees and managed professionally.
Regular assessments are carried out by independent actuaries and the long-term contribution rates decided on the basis of their recommendations.
There are also a number of defined contribution schemes with benefits based on contributions to the benefit fund.
In the UK, US, Canada and South Africa, the Group has certain post-retirement medical benefit schemes whereby the Group contributes towards medical costs for certain retirees.
These contributions are paid only for retirees who were members of such medical schemes before retirement.

In assessing the Group's post-retirement liabilities the Group monitors mortality assumptions and uses up-to-date mortality tables.
The mortality assumptions for the UK scheme were updated in 2005 following the work performed for the full triennial funding valuation.
Statistical analysis performed for the funding valuation demonstrates that the mortality assumption applied is consistent with recent experience.
Allowance is made in all significant schemes for expected future increases in life expectancy.

The plan assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.
In 2005, the Group elected to make an additional 25 million and 6 million contribution to the UK and US pension schemes respectively.
These payments are part of a more long-term plan to reduce the Groups pension deficit.
The expected rates of return on individual categories of plan assets are determined after taking advice from external expert advice and using available market data, for example by reference to relevant equity and bond indices published by Stock Exchanges.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the plans investment portfolio.
The history of the plan for the current and prior period is as follows: 2005 2004 m m Present value of defined benefit obligation 2,666 2,372 Fair value of plan assets 2,297 1,887 Deficit 369 485 Experience adjustments on plan liabilities 184 143 Experience adjustments on plan assets 260 71 In accordance with the transitional provisions for the amendments to IAS 19 in December 2004, the disclosures above are determined prospectively from the 2004 reporting period.
The Group expects to contribute approximately 62 million to its defined benefit plan in 2006.
In addition management have agreed to make an additional contribution of approximately 95 million in 2006 to further fund its defined benefit obligation and will be making further additional contributions totalling 65 million over the following few years.
