Reconciliation of income statement m At 31 December Profit after tax & minority interests Notes 2004 As reported under UK GAAP 239 Recognition and valuation of financial instruments 2 3 Post employment benefits 3 5 Other items 4 3 As reported under IFRS 250 Note 1: Dividend recognition Under UK GAAP, dividends were accrued in the period to which they related regardless of when they were declared and approved.
Under IAS 10, Events after the Balance Sheet Date IAS 10, dividends are only accrued when declared and appropriately approved.
The reversal of accrued dividends has increased equity by 56 million at 31 December 2004.
There is no profit or loss impact.
Note 2: Recognition and valuation of financial instruments Under IFRS, financial instruments have been classified as fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and loans and receivables and fair valued as required.
The fair value movements for these financial instruments have been recognised in the income statement or equity as appropriate.
Available-for-sale fair value adjustments are transferred out of equity to the income statement on sale or impairment.
Derivatives, as required under IFRS, are included in the fair value through profit or loss classification and recognised on the balance sheet at fair value.
The impact of the above adjustments is an increase of 5 million to equity at 31 December 2004 and an increase of 3 million to profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2004, mainly representing the cumulative fair value changes on financial instruments.
The Company has elected to designate specific securities that as fair value through the income statement, where the treatment eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise when using a different measurement basis and these items are managed evaluated and reported using a fair value basis.
Old Mutual plc 200 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 51 TRANSITION TO IFRS COMPANY continued Note 3: Post-employment benefits Under UK GAAP, post-employment costs were charged to the income statement account so as to spread the related charges over the service lives of employees and were determined by independent qualified actuaries undertaking formal actuarial valuations at least every three years.
In accordance with IAS 19, the projected benefit obligation is matched against the fair value of the underlying assets and other unrecognised actuarial gains and losses in determining the expense for the year.
Any asset or obligation must be recorded in the balance sheet, and separate recognition of the operating and financing costs of defined benefits and similarly funded employee benefits is required in the income statement.
IAS 19 permits a number of options for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
The Company has elected to recognise actuarial gains and losses using the corridor method and take advantage of the IFRS 1 exemption allowing any previously unrecognised actuarial gains or losses to be recognised in full on the balance sheet, at the date of transition 1 January 2004.
Note 4: Other items Other items principally comprise the reversal of amortised issue costs on the Companys $750 million preferred security required as a result of the transition to IFRS.
This has resulted in a net increase to equity of 6 million at 31 December 2004 and an associated increase to profit after tax of 3 million.
Note 5: Cash flow statement Under UK GAAP a cash flow statement was not reported for the Company.
