Due to this, management believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for impairment of trade debtors.
In certain wholesale businesses overdue accounts are subject to interest penalties.
The value of interest levied in such cases is not significant.

c Currency and interest rate profile The Group carries a cash flow risk when there are changes in the interest rates levied on the Groups floating rate borrowings.
The Group is exposed to fair value risk in respect of the Groups fixed rate borrowings.
These risks are managed using interest rate swap derivative instruments.
Where the borrowings are denominated in a foreign currency the Group hedges this through the use of cross-currency derivative instruments.
Details of derivative financial instruments are provided in note 30.
The Groups borrowings were denominated in the following currencies: Obligations under Bank finance overdrafts Bank loans Loan notes Senior notes leases Total million million million million million million At 31 December 2005 Sterling 56.9 1.9 51.5 6.2 116.5 Euro 77.0 172.7 0.2 21.8 9.1 280.8 Czech Koruna 10.4 19.1 29.5 Norwegian Kroner 7.9 7.9 US Dollar 386.9 386.9 144.3 199.7 2.1 460.2 15.3 821.6 At 31 December 2004 Sterling 1.1 17.3 2.9 50.0 6.4 77.7 Euro 63.1 189.8 0.2 21.2 9.8 284.1 Czech Koruna 17.9 7.1 25.0 Norwegian Kroner 7.1 7.1 Swiss Franc 27.6 27.6 US Dollar 335.6 335.6 82.1 248.9 3.1 406.8 16.2 757.1 The comparative amounts at 31 December 2004 are before the impact of derivative financial instruments taken out to hedge currency risk.
In addition, the Group has Sterling and Euro denominated financial liabilities relating to financing linked to securitisation see note 29.
The effective interest rates at the balance sheet dates were as follows: 2005 2004 % % Bank overdrafts 3.4 3.9 Bank loans 2.7 3.1 Loan notes 4.4 4.4 Senior notes 6.9 6.9 Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
The interest rates applicable to bank overdrafts, bank loans and loan notes are all floating rates.
The effective interest rates for these are very closely related to the relevant LIBOR rate plus any margin as at the balance sheet date.
The weighted average interest rate for bank overdrafts and loans during the year was 3.5% 2004 5.8%.
Loan notes carried a weighted average interest rate during the year of 4.4% 2004 4.4%.
The Senior notes bear interest at fixed rates and therefore the effective interest rate is the rate required to discount the future expected cash flows over the expected life of the debt to equal the carrying value of the debt.
The fixed interest rates are shown in the table in section a of this note.
