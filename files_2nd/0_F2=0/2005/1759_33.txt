Notes to the company accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom UK GAAP.
The going concern basis has been applied in these accounts.
In the Companys accounts, all fixed asset investments including subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are stated at cost or valuation in respect of certain listed investments less provisions for impairments.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the Companys profit and loss account.
In accordance with section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
The amount of profit for the financial year of the Company is disclosed in note 14 to these accounts.
Relief under sections 131 and 133 of the Companies Act 1985 is taken wherever possible.
Accordingly, where such relief is available, the difference between the fair value and aggregate nominal value of shares is not recognised in either shareholders funds or cost of investment.
Cash flow statement The Company is exempt under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 1, paragraph 5a, from the requirement to publish its own cash flow statement, as its cash flows are included within the consolidated cash flow statement of the Group.
Foreign currencies Transactions in overseas currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
These exchange differences are recognised in the profit and loss account unless they qualify for hedge accounting treatment, in which case the effective portion is recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
Tangible fixed assets Depreciation is provided, normally on a straight line basis, to write off the cost or valuation of tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful economic lives to any estimated residual value using the following rates: Buildings up to 50 years, or the lease term if shorter Computing equipment, motor vehicles and short life works equipment 3 to 5 years No depreciation is provided on freehold land and assets in the course of construction.
Impairment reviews are undertaken if there are indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Leases Assets obtained under finance leases are included in tangible fixed assets at cost and are depreciated over their useful economic lives, or the term of their lease, whichever is shorter.
Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included within loans.
Rental payments are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged as interest to the profit and loss account, and the capital element, which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments, so as to give a constant rate of charge on the outstanding obligation.
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis in arriving at operating profit.
Investments The Companys investment in shares in group companies are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost, including all relevant overhead expenditure, and net realisable value.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 147 Notes to the company accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Tax The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes account of taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised on an undiscounted basis in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date where there is an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Company contributes to Group pension plans operated in the UK.
Details of the principal plans and the financial assumptions used are contained in the consolidated accounts of BAE Systems plc.
As permitted by Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits FRS 17, the plans are accounted for as defined contribution plans, as the employer cannot identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the plans.
The employers contributions are set in relation to the current service period only.
Share options and own shares held In accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 25 National insurance contributions on share option gains UITF 25 the Company provides in full for the employers national insurance liability estimated to arise on the future exercise of share options granted, except where the employee has agreed to settle the employers national insurance liability as a condition of the grant of the options.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption offered in Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 17 Employee share schemes UITF 17 from charging to the profit and loss account the 20% discount offered to employees partaking in such Company operated SAYE schemes.
As required under Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts UITF 38 the cost to the Company of own shares held is shown as a deduction from shareholders funds within the profit and loss account.
Consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of the Companys own shares in the ESOP trust is shown separately in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds.
Preference share capital The Company has in issue 7.75p net cumulative preference shares of 25p each that are convertible into the Companys ordinary shares of 2.5p each at the option of the holder on 31 May in any of the years up to 2007, on the basis of 0.47904 ordinary shares for every preference share.
From 1 July 2007 to 1 January 2010, the Company may redeem any outstanding shares at 100p per share, together with any arrears and accruals of dividends.
The Company has adopted Financial Reporting Standard 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation FRS 25 with effect from 1 January 2005.
In accordance with FRS 25, the Company is not required to restate comparative information but is required to present the comparative information.
Accordingly, the Company has presented its 2004 comparative information for preference share capital in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 4 Capital Instruments FRS 4.
The policies for the year ended 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004 are discussed below.
Further information on the impact of the changes in accounting policies are given below.
Periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 In accordance with FRS 25 the preference shares are considered a compound financial instrument and accordingly, have been split into an underlying debt instrument, classified within loans and overdrafts, and an equity conversion option, classified within equity.
The underlying debt instrument is presented on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the preference shares.
The equity conversion option is presented at its historic fair value, based on the date of original issue of the preference shares.
On conversion of a preference share into ordinary shares, the attributable amount of the equity component is reclassified to share capital and share premium.
From 1 July 2007, the option to convert into ordinary shares is extinguished, and accordingly the remaining balance on the equity conversion option will be transferred to the retained earnings reserve.
Dividends thereon are recognised in the income statement as finance costs.
Period to 31 December 2004 The preference shares are presented as a component of equity.
Dividends thereon are recognised as a deduction from reserves.
Dividends Equity dividends on ordinary share capital are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared.
148 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 1 Accounting policies continued Changes in accounting policies Adoption of FRS 17 For accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, the Company is required to account for retirement benefit plans in accordance with FRS 17, and is required to apply the requirements of FRS 17 retrospectively.
Accordingly, the pension prepayment of 273m at 31 December 2004 previously recognised within debtors due after one year under Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for pension costs has been reversed.
This has reduced net assets at 31 December 2004.
Adoption of FRS 21 For accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, the Company is required to account for events occurring after the balance sheet date in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 21 Events after the balance sheet date FRS 21, and is required to apply the requirements of FRS 21 retrospectively.
Accordingly, the 2004 final equity dividend of 178m previously recognised at 31 December 2004 within creditors due within one year has been reversed since it was not declared at the balance sheet date.
This has increased net assets at 31 December 2004.
Adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26 For accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, the Company is required to measure and disclose amounts defined as financial instruments in accordance with FRS 25 and FRS 26.
In accordance with FRS 25, the Company is not required to restate comparative information.
The impact of adopting FRS 25 and FRS 26 is discussed below: Derivative financial instruments Under UK GAAP the fair value of financial instruments designated as hedging instruments were not separately recognised on the balance sheet as either a financial asset or financial liability.
The underlying assets and liabilities against which the hedging instruments had been designated were recorded at the appropriate hedge rate.
With the adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26 from 1 January 2005, the Company was required to restate its underlying hedged assets and liabilities at the prevailing balance sheet rate, and separately account for the fair value of the hedging instruments as either financial assets or financial liabilities.
All such instruments were measured at fair value as at the balance sheet date.
The impact of this change was a reduction in the Companys net assets of 41m.
Exchangeable Bonds Following adoption of FRS 26, the Company determined that the option holders right to request to exchange their Bonds for the Exchange Property, represented by the Companys shareholding in Vodafone Group Plc note 6, was an embedded derivative.
Accordingly, this embedded derivative had to be separated from the underlying debt instrument, measured at fair value and accounted for separately within the balance sheet.
The fair values of the underlying debt instrument and the embedded derivative are determined as follows: Underlying debt instrument On adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26, the underlying debt instrument is presented on a net present value basis within loans and overdrafts note 8.
At subsequent period ends, the value of the debt instrument continues to be presented on a net present value basis, with the amortisation charge being recognised in finance costs in the profit and loss account, until the instrument is extinguished on conversion to the Exchange Property or maturity.
The impact of this change was a 24m reduction in the recorded value of the Exchangeable Bonds as at 1 January 2005.
Embedded derivative On adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26, the value of the embedded derivative was calculated by reference to the market value of the Bonds at 1 January 2005, less the carrying value of the underlying debt instrument recognised at that date.
Subsequent movements in the fair value of the embedded derivative are recognised in finance costs in the profit and loss account.
The impact of this change was the recognition of a 62m embedded derivative liability within other financial liabilities as at 1 January 2005.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 149 Notes to the company accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Exchange property Following adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26, the Company has designated the Exchange Property as at fair value through profit or loss.
Movements in the fair value of the Exchange Property will continue to be recognised in finance costs in the profit and loss account.
Preference shares Under UK GAAP, the preference shares were treated as a component of equity, and the redemption value of 266m was recorded as the total of non-equity shareholders funds.
The preference shares allow the preference shareholders to convert their holding into ordinary shares of the Company on the basis of 0.47904 ordinary shares for every preference share on 31 May each year to 2007.
From 1 July 2007 to 1 January 2010, the Group may redeem all of the remaining preference shares at any time at 100p per share, together with any arrears and accruals of dividends.
Following adoption of FRS 25, the Company determined that the existence of the conversion option over the Companys ordinary shares meant the preference shares met the definition of a compound financial instrument, consisting of an underlying debt component and an equity conversion option.
Accordingly the equity conversion option had to be separated from the underlying debt instrument, measured at fair value at the date of issue of the preference shares and accounted for separately.
The fair values of the underlying debt instrument and equity conversion option were determined as follows: Underlying debt instrument The fair value of the liability component was calculated by discounting the value of the expected future cash flows under the terms of the instrument using a market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
The impact of this change was the recognition of a 223m loan within liabilities falling due after one year as at 1 January 2005.
Equity option of convertible preference shares The equity option over the Companys ordinary shares was calculated as at the date of issue of the preference shares as the difference between the discounted value of the underlying debt instrument as at issue date and the net proceeds received on issue of the preference shares.
The value of the equity conversion option does not change other than where options have been extinguished.
The impact of this change was a net 12m increase in the total equity of the Company: m fide-recognition of amounts previously recorded within issued share capital 66 Recognition of fair value of equity conversion option 78 12 150 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2005 2 Tangible fixed assets Land and buildings Plant and equipment Total m m m Cost At 1 January 2005 30 38 68 Additions 22 Disposals 4 4 At 31 December 2005 26 40 66 Depreciation and Impairment At 1 January 2005 13 33 46 Depreciation 112 Disposals 1 1 At 31 December 2005 13 34 47 Net book value At 31 December 2005 13 6 19 At 31 December 2004 17 5 22 The amounts above at 31 December 2005 include: Land and buildings Plant and equipment Total m m m Capitalised finance leases Cost 2424 Accumulated depreciation 2424 Assets let under operating leases Cost 13 13 Accumulated depreciation 7 7 Net book value of: Freehold property 3 3 Long leasehold property 6 6 Short leasehold property 4 4 Fixtures, fittings and equipment 66 13 6 19 Land and buildings comprise: freehold and long leasehold land and buildings owned by the Company as at 30 June 1996, excluding certain overseas properties, revalued at that date.
The majority of the Groups operational properties at that time were valued on a depreciated replacement basis, owing to their specialisation, with the remainder on an existing use value basis.
Other non-operational properties were valued on the basis of open market value: short leaseholds at cost: additions subsequent to 30 June 1996 at cost: and land and buildings owned by subsidiary undertakings acquired since 30 June 1996 at fair value at the date of acquisition.

The European Investment Bank borrowing consists of three sterling denominated loans, two of which mature in 2006 and the third during 2009.
The coupon rate on each loan is fixed with the weighted average interest rate on these loans being 6.86%.
The SYSTEMS 2001 Asset Trust bonds are at a floating rate of interest, having been converted to a sterling floating rate bond by utilising a cross-currency swap which resulted in an effective interest rate during 2005 of 5.74%.
The Alvis loan notes were issued to certain shareholders of Alvis plc as part of the consideration paid on acquisition of that company in 2004.
The notes pay a floating sterling rate of interest on the principal amount outstanding and are redeemable at par at the option of the holder on 31 December in any of the years up to 2009, at which time any outstanding balance will be redeemed by the Company.

The Company has not adopted amendments to FRS 26 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which will apply for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2006.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the financial statements for the period commencing 1 January 2006.

During the year 187,489 shares were converted for 89,814 ordinary shares.
The Group may redeem all of the remaining preference shares at any time after 1 July 2007 and, in any case, will redeem any remaining shares on 1 January 2010, in each case at 100p per share together with any arrears and accruals of dividend.
The maximum redemption value of the preference shares, ignoring any arrears or accruals of dividend, is therefore 266m.
As stated in note 1, the Company has adopted FRS 26 from 1 January 2005.
In accordance with FRS 25 the convertible preference shares are considered to be a compound financial instrument consisting of both a debt element and an equity component which require separate accounting treatment.
Under FRS 25, the equity option element of preference shares of 78m is included as a separate component of equity.
The debt component is stated at amortised cost within loans and overdrafts.
The preference shares carry voting rights at a general meeting of BAE Systems plc the Company only where the preferential dividend is six months or more in arrears, or where a motion is to be proposed which abrogates, varies or modifies the rights of the preference shareholders, or where a motion is to be proposed for the winding up of the Company.
On a winding up, holders of the preference shares are entitled, after repayment of the capital paid up on the Special Share and in priority to any payment to any other class of shareholder, to the return of amounts paid up or credited as paid up on the preference shares together with a premium of 75p per share, and all arrears of preferential dividends.
Special Share One Special Share of 1 in the Company is held on behalf of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry the Special Shareholder.
Certain parts of the Companys Articles of Association cannot be amended without the consent of the Special Shareholder.
These articles include the requirement that no foreign person, or foreign persons acting in concert, can have an interest in more than 15% of the Company, the requirement that the majority of the directors are British, and the requirement that the Chief Executive and any executive chairman are British citizens.
The effect of these requirements can also be amended by regulations made by the directors and approved by the Special Shareholder.
The Special Shareholder may require the Company at any time to redeem the Special Share at par or to convert the Special Share into one ordinary voting share.
The Special Shareholder is entitled to receive notice of and to attend general meetings and class meetings of the Companys shareholders but has no voting right, nor other rights, other than to speak in relation to any business in respect of the Special Share.
