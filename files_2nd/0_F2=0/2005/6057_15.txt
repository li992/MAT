NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Principal accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year, with the exception of the policy for accounting for ESOP Trusts which is explained in note b below, in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modied to include the revaluation of certain xed assets, and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
b Change in accounting policies UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts has been adopted.
Investments in own shares are now deducted from shareholders funds whereas previously such investments were treated as an asset.
The impact of this restatement is to reduce shareholders funds at 31 March 2004 by 0.6m.
c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings: all accounts are made up to 31 March 2005.
The results of subsidiary undertakings are included in the financial statements under the principles of FRS 6 from the date control passes.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
The retained profit for the Company for the year to 31 March 2005 is set out in note 23.
In the accounts of the Company, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the profit and loss account to the extent that they represent a realised profit for the Company.
d Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions made after 1 April 1998 is shown on the balance sheet as an intangible xed asset.
Where capitalised goodwill is regarded as having a limited useful economic life, it is amortised over that life.
Where capitalised goodwill is regarded as having an indefinite useful economic life, it is not amortised.
Where capitalised goodwill is amortised over a life of greater than 20 years, or is not amortised, annual impairment reviews are conducted to compare the book value with the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount has fallen below the book value, the goodwill is written down to the recoverable amount immediately.
The Companies Act 1985 requires goodwill that is treated as an asset to be amortised systematically over a nite period.
In order to show a true and fair view of the Groups results, goodwill of 68.6m arising on the acquisitions of Mainline and Capital Citybus is not being amortised because of a number of factors which have led the Directors to conclude that the goodwill has an indefinite life.
These include the stability of the bus industry, its lack of fundamental change and the Groups track record in maintaining and enhancing the values of its businesses.
This treatment of goodwill as having an indefinite life is in accordance with FRS 10.
It is not possible to quantify the effect on the Groups results if the Act were to be followed, as it would depend on the nite life that was used.
Capitalised goodwill arising on other acquisitions is being amortised over a period of up to 20 years on a straight-line basis.
Capitalised goodwill arising on foreign acquisitions is denominated in the currency in which the acquired companys assets and liabilities are recorded.
Fair value accounting adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions.
In the year of acquisition, some adjustments are made using provisional estimates, based on information available at the time the financial statements are prepared, and amendments are sometimes necessary in the following accounting period, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, when the information necessary to determine these estimates is available.
Prior to 1 April 1998, all goodwill arising on acquisitions was written off to reserves.
This goodwill has not been reinstated on the balance sheet.
On disposal of the businesses concerned this goodwill is included in determining the gain or loss on disposal in the profit and loss account.
e Turnover Turnover of the Group comprises principally of revenue from train passenger and freight services, road passenger transport, and certain management and maintenance services in the UK and North America.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales taxes.
Turnover in UK Rail includes franchise agreement receipts from the Strategic Rail Authority SRA.
Payments to the SRA for amounts due under the terms of a franchise are included in operating costs.
Turnover also includes amounts attributable to the train operating companies TOCs, predominantly based on models of route usage, by the Railway Settlement Plan in respect of passenger receipts.
Where season tickets are issued in excess of one weeks duration, the attributable share of income is deferred within creditors and is recognised in the profit and loss account over the period covered by the season ticket.
UK Bus turnover principally comprises amounts receivable from ticket sales and concessionary fare schemes.
Concessionary amounts are recognised in the period in which the service is provided based on a predetermined formula as agreed with the relevant local authority.
Other Bus and services revenue from contracts with government bodies and similar organisations are recognised as the services are provided.
38 1 Principal accounting policies continued f Fixed assets and depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation less residual value of tangible xed assets over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years straight line Long leasehold buildings 50 years straight line Short leasehold properties period of lease Passenger carrying vehicles 7 to 15 years straight line Other plant and equipment 3 to 25 years straight line No depreciation is provided on freehold land, the land element of long leasehold properties or on assets in the course of construction.
Surpluses or deficits arising on the revaluation of tangible xed assets are credited or debited to a revaluation reserve.
On a subsequent disposal of a revalued asset, the revaluation surplus or deficit relating to this asset is transferred to the profit and loss account reserve.
From 1 April 1999 the Groups policy has been not to revalue tangible xed assets.
Properties that had been revalued before that date retained their book value, in accordance with the transitional rules of FRS 15. g Hire purchase contracts and leases Assets held under hire purchase contracts and under finance leases, which are those leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group are recorded in the balance sheet as tangible xed assets.
Depreciation is provided on these assets over their estimated useful lives or lease term, as appropriate.
Future obligations under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are included in creditors, net of finance charges.
Payments are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the profit and loss account as interest, and the capital element, which reduces the outstanding obligations.
The finance charges are calculated in relation to the reducing amount of obligations outstanding and are charged to the profit and loss account on the same basis.
All other leases are operating leases and the rental charges are taken to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
h Government grants and subsidies Rail support grants and amounts receivable for tendered services and concessionary fare schemes are included in turnover and are recognised in the profit and loss account as the related expenditure is incurred.
i Stocks and work in progress Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
j Pre-contract expenditure Pre-contract expenditure is expensed as incurred except where it is virtually certain that a contract will be awarded.
In such circumstances, precontract expenditure is recognised as an asset and is expensed to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.
k Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the year end and results of foreign enterprises are translated at the average rates of exchange during the year.
Differences on exchange arising on the retranslation of net investments in foreign enterprises and from the translation of results at an average rate are taken to reserves.
Where foreign currency borrowings or currency swaps are used to finance or hedge investments in foreign enterprises, the gain or loss on translation is also taken to reserves.
All other exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
l Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Provision is made for deferred tax on all timing differences except those arising from the revaluation of xed assets for which there is no binding agreement to sell on property gains if it is anticipated that rollover relief will be available and on the undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates at which it is estimated the tax will arise.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
The deferred tax provision is not discounted to net present value.
39 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 Principal accounting policies continued m Pension costs Retirement benets are provided for most employees of the Group principally by means of dened benefit pension schemes.
These are funded by contributions from the Group and employees.
The Groups contributions are charged to the profit and loss account, based on recommendations by independent actuaries, in such a way as to provide for the liabilities evenly over the average remaining working lives of the employees.
The difference between the charge to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid by the Group is shown as an asset or a liability in the balance sheet and the tax effect of this timing difference is included in deferred taxation.
For dened contribution schemes the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
n Financial instruments Various derivative instruments are utilised by the Group principally to manage interest rate, fuel and foreign exchange risks.
The Group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts.
All such instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk prole of an existing underlying exposure of the Group, in line with the Groups risk management policies.
The main instruments used during the year were xed interest rate swaps, fuel swaps and currency swaps.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps and fuel derivatives are recognised as adjustments to interest expense and fuel costs respectively over the period of the contracts.
o Insurance The Groups policy is to self-insure high frequency, low value claims within the businesses.
To provide protection above these types of losses, cover is obtained through third-party insurance policies.
Provision is made, on a discounted basis, for the estimated cost of settling insurance claims for incidents occurring prior to balance sheet date.
p Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after the deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the amortisation of debt issuance fees in respect of the accounting period and reduced by repayments made in the period.

The tax on the gains arising would only become payable if the property were sold without rollover relief being available.
The tax which would be payable under such circumstances is estimated to be 0.2m 2004: 0.2m.
These assets are expected to be used in the continuing operations of the business and, therefore no tax is expected to be paid in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax has been recognised on property gains as it is anticipated that rollover relief will be available.
To benefit from the relief the proceeds should be reinvested in new property within three years of disposal.
The tax that would be payable assuming that reinvestment was not made within three years amounts to 7.0m 2004: 6.0m.
No deferred tax has been provided on the future remittance of overseas reserves as it is not expected that the reserves will be repatriated to the UK in the foreseeable future.

As a result of movements in interest rates, differences arise between book values and fair values, which are categorised as unrecognised gains and losses as required under FRS 13.
The Group also protects its financial position and performance against fuel price risk using a range of fuel derivatives.
Movements in fuel prices relative to the prices provided by the derivatives gives rise to differences between book and fair values which are categorised as unrecognised gains and losses as required under FRS 13.
Fair values for derivatives and the bonds have been supplied externally by the respective counterparties and banks using market rates prevailing at year end.
The book value of the 300m bond is stated at its par value less issue costs of 4.0m 2004: 4.5m.
The book value of the 250m bond, which is swapped to US Dollars is stated at its par value less issue costs of 1.2m 2004: 1.3m and net of an unrealised foreign exchange gain of 16.9m 2004: gain of 9.1m.
Fair values for hire purchase debt and loan notes have been determined by discounting future cash ows that will arise under these liabilities.
The movement in net unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used to hedge interest rate risk and fuel price risk are as follows: Net unrecognised gains losses 2005 2004 m m At beginning of year 3.0 15.7 Arising in previous year but recognised in the year 4.3 23.4 Arising before beginning of year and remaining at the end of the year 1.3 7.7 Arising in the year 29.9 4.7 At end of year 28.6 3.0 It is expected that 26.8m of the net unrecognised gains 2004: 3.0m will be recognised in the following year.

The letters of credit relate substantially to insurance arrangements in the UK and North America.
The Company has provided a 15.5m 2004: 15.5m unsecured loan facility to Great Western Trains Company Limited GWT, a 3.2m unsecured loan facility to First Keolis TransPennine Limited TPE and a 13.6m unsecured loan facility to First ScotRail Limited as required by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising.

UK bus subsidiaries have provided unsecured guarantees on a joint and several basis to Trustees of the UK Occupational Pension Scheme.
Certain of the Companys subsidiaries have issued unsecured guarantees to the Companys bondholders.
These unsecured guarantees rank pari passu with unsecured guarantees provided by those subsidiaries to lenders participating in the Groups 520m syndicated bank facility.
30 Pension schemes The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes which cover the majority of UK employees and certain North American employees.
These are principally dened benefit schemes under which benets provided are based on employees number of years of service and final salary.
The scope of benets varies between schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held in separately administered trusts which are managed independently of the Groups nances by investment managers appointed by the schemes trustees.
Formal independent actuarial valuations are undertaken at least triennially.
The various dened benefit schemes include five UK Bus Division schemes where the subsidiary undertaking is a participating employer in a scheme operated by a local authority.
These schemes are subject to relevant local government regulations.
Great Western Trains Company Limited, First ScotRail Limited, First Great Western Link Limited, GB Rail and TransPennine Express have sections in the Railways Pension Scheme RPS which is an industry-wide arrangement for employees of those companies previously owned by British Railways Board.
All other Group schemes are self-administered.
At their last triennial valuations, the dened benefit schemes had funding levels between 68.0% and 121.0%.
The market value of the assets at 31 March 2005 for all dened benefit schemes totalled 1,580m 2004: 1,254m.
Contributions are paid to all dened benefit schemes in accordance with rates recommended by the schemes actuaries.
The total charge to the profit and loss account in the year in respect of dened benefit schemes was 43.4m 2004: 31.9m.
The valuation assumptions used for accounting purposes have been made uniform to Group standards, as appropriate, when each scheme is actuarially valued.
For these new valuations excluding the local government and RPS schemes, the assumptions which are being used are that the rate of return on investment will be 7.0% pre-retirement 6.75% in respect of future benefit accrual, and 6.0% post-retirement 5.75% in respect of future benefit accrual, the rate of earnings growth will be 4.0%, and the rate of ination will be 2.5%.
These new valuations are made using the projected unit method.
54 30 Pension schemes continued Prepayment A net prepayment of 59.6m 2004: 47.4m is included in the Groups consolidated balance sheet in respect of the sum of the cumulative differences between contributions paid by the Group into the schemes and the charge to the profit and loss account under SSAP 24, and the surpluses and deficits that have been recognised on acquisition.
For accounting purposes the pension costs for the RPS are determined by spreading the expected company cash contributions over the term of the relevant franchise.
Dened contribution schemes In addition, the Group operates some dened contribution schemes, the assets of which are held in separately administered trusts.
The cost of these in the year was 3.6m 2004: 2.3m.
The Group pays certain costs on behalf of the various pension schemes and then re-charges the costs to the schemes.
Transitional FRS 17 disclosures The additional disclosures required by FRS 17 during the transitional period for the dened benefit schemes are set out below.
They are based on the most recent actuarial valuations described above, which have been updated by independent professionally qualied actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17.
