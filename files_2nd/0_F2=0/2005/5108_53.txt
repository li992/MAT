Substantially all of the employees accepted employers Secondary National Insurance contributions due on the exercise of the first tranche of options.
It is a condition of those options granted since March 2000 that the option holders accept liability for the employers Secondary National Insurance contributions due on the exercise of the options.
For UK employees, once vested, the options remain in place should the employee leave the Group and may be exercised within a period ending ten years from the date of grant.
For Swiss employees, once vested, the options remain in place should the employee leave the Group and may be exercised within a period ending seven years from the date of grant.
An easyJet Supplemental Flotation Share Option Scheme was established in respect of both UK and Swiss employees to grant options to a number of participants who had inadvertently been issued with incorrect paperwork or who had been omitted from the original grants.
These supplemental options replaced original options, which had lapsed, but which had been included in the aggregate totals disclosed in the Listing Particulars for the Company when it listed.
These options are included in the table of share options and grants outstanding above.
ii The easyJet Non-Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme 2000 This award of options over ordinary shares in easyJet plc was granted in December 2000 to eligible employees of FLS easyTech Limited easyTech, a 25% associate of easyJet Airline Company Limited with a three-year vesting period and no performance criteria.
This grant was a catch-up, as it had not been possible to grant options to these employees under the easyJet Key Employee Pre-Flotation Share Option Scheme.
Further awards were made in December 2001, March 2003, January 2004 and December 2004 to all eligible easyJet employees, and in June 2005 to two employees.
The options granted are subject to a three-year vesting period and will be exercisable subject to performance criteria.
iii The easyJet Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme This award of options over ordinary shares in easyJet plc was granted in December 2001 to eligible employees of the Group on terms that meet Inland Revenue requirements for an approved share option scheme.
Further awards were made in March 2003, January 2004, December 2004 and June 2005.
82 Annual report and accounts 05 19 Share options and other share awards continued iv The easyJet Management Combination Incentive Plan Since July 2002, a total of 3,148,572 shares have been granted under the terms of the plan, which rewarded key participants in the process of combining the businesses of easyJet and Go Fly with free shares when the three performance milestones of single brand, single AOC and combination completion were met.
All milestones have been met.
95,063 shares have lapsed since the inception of the scheme, and all share options have now been exercised or have lapsed.
Employee Trusts have been set up to manage the share option schemes.
easyJet Trustees Limited, a company incorporated in Jersey, manages two trusts, one for the benefit of UK employees and one for the benefit of Swiss employees.
When an employee exercises a share option under either the easyJet Key Employee Pre-Flotation Share Option Plan, the easyJet Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme or the easyJet Non-Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme, new shares are issued for the benefit of the trust.
Once the employee has made suitable arrangements for the funding of the option price and related tax liabilities which may include sale of some of the shares, then the shares are transferred to the benefit of the employee, at which point they are then able to sell the shares if they wish.
The period from the date of exercise to the date that the employee can first sell shares for their own benefit is usually four days.
During this period, all share price movement risk is with the employee.
Where shares are sold to meet tax liabilities, all transaction costs are met by the employee.
For the Management Combination Incentive Plan, easyJet purchased shares on the open market, so does not need to issue shares on exercise of the options.
Otherwise, the process of allocation of shares operates in a similar fashion.
v Sharesave Scheme Employees resident in the UK, including Executive Directors, are eligible to participate in UK Inland Revenue approved all-employee sharesave schemes, subject to eligibility of service.
The Sharesave Scheme comprises employee savingsrelated share options to subscribe for ordinary shares in the Company.
Participants contribute a monthly amount of between 5 and 250 for a fixed period of three years.
At the end of the savings period, the contributions may be used to exercise options to subscribe for ordinary shares in the Company.
The option price is determined at each grant date, and is capped at 20% of the market price of the Companys shares at the date of grant.
The Company made a grant under the Sharesave Scheme in June 2005, with options being granted at a discount of 20% to the market price at the time of the grant.
easyJet also operates an International Sharesave Scheme for employees who are not employed by UK Group companies.
Similar terms and conditions apply to the UK scheme, albeit without the UK tax benefits.
vi Share Incentive Plan Employees resident in the UK, including Executive Directors, are eligible to participate in the Share Incentive Plan.
Employees can allocate part of their pre-tax salary up to a maximum of 1,500 per annum, to purchase shares in easyJet through a partnership scheme without paying National Insurance contributions or income tax.
For every share purchased through the partnership scheme, easyJet purchases a matching share.
Employees must remain in employment with easyJet three years from the date of purchase of the first share in order to qualify for the second matching share, and for five years for the partnership shares to be transferred to them tax free.
The employee retains rights over both their own shares and the matching shares, receives dividends and are able to vote at meetings once the shares are purchased.
At 30 September 2005, 34,663 matching shares had been purchased.
easyJet also operates an International Share Incentive Plan for employees who are not employed by UK Group companies.
