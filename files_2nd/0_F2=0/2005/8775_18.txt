The final amount of the penalty due will only be determined at the end of the appeal process.
Based upon legal advice, the Board currently regard a 2 million provision as being adequate.

The pension costs of the scheme for the 42 weeks up to 14 November 2003 were 481,000.
No disclosures have been made in these Financial statements in respect of Financial Reporting Standard 17: Retirement Benefits, because the sale of the whole of the share capital of TJ Hughes Limited resulted in JJB Sports plc ceasing to have any responsibility for the scheme.

a Financial risks and policies Set out below is a summary of the main financial risks faced by the Group during the accounting period and the policies employed to address these risks.
These policies have been applied consistently throughout the accounting period and are explained in more detail in the Financial review on pages 10 to 11 of the Annual report.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy throughout the accounting period has been to use the revolving bank credit facility together with retained profits, to achieve continuity of funding and short-term flexibility.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through the revolving bank credit facility and its retained profits.
Floating rates of interest are charged on the bank facility.
No interest rate hedging agreement is currently in place because given the level of borrowings and the current interest rate environment, the Board does not consider fluctuations in interest rates to pose a significant risk to the Group.
Foreign currency risk The majority of the Groups trading activities are conducted with United Kingdom suppliers and customers, the transactions being payable and receivable in sterling: only approximately 25 million of the Groups annualised purchases are settled in US dollars.
In December 2004, the Group entered into a series of forward contracts which cover its dollar requirements through to July 2005, at a fixed rate of exchange.
These contracts mature evenly in February, April and June 2005 and protect the Groups trading position and Balance sheet from significant exchange rate movements.
The Groups treasury department tracks the sterling dollar exchange rate on a continuous basis to minimise the Group risk to currency fluctuations.

The revolving credit facility expires on 23 June 2005 and the Group are currently in negotiations with its Bankers to renew its borrowing requirements.
f Fair values There is no material difference between the book value and the fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
29 Office of Fair Trading In August 2003, the Office of Fair Trading OFT pronounced JJB guilty of price-fixing in the sale of certain replica kit products over a two year period during 2000 and 2001 and levied a penalty of 8.4 million.
JJB appealed to the Competition Appeal Tribunal CAT against the OFT's decision on liability and against the level of the penalty itself.
The result of the appeal against the decision of the OFT on liability, although given mainly in favour of the OFT, included some elements that were found in JJBs favour.
The decision of the CAT in the appeal against the level of the penalty was announced on 19 May 2005 and reduced the penalty to 6.7 million.
JJB is to seek permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the CATs decision in relation both to important aspects of its decision on liability and on the level of the penalty.
On the basis of legal advice, JJB has created a provision of 2 million against any potential liability.
30 Post balance sheet event On 11 March 2005, JJB acquired an irrevocable 999 year licence from Slazengers Limited for 10 million for the exclusive right to design, source and sell Slazenger-branded golf clubs, balls, clothing, footwear and accessories in the European Economic Area.
This licence replaces a previous royalty agreement between the two companies and should ensure unrestricted product development, enhanced gross margin and income generation from the brand.
This acquisition will be treated as an addition in Intangible fixed assets.
