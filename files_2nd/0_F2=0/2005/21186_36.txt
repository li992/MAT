The tests led to impairment of goodwill in the amount of 43 million.
Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives have been tested for impairment in these businesses as follows: Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 129 15 Goodwill continued Spain long-term business The recoverable amount of the Spanish unit has been determined based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation.
This calculation is an  appraisal value and is based on the embedded value of the business together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
The recoverable amount signicantly exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill and a reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause the carrying value of the cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Embedded value represents the shareholder interest in the life business and is calculated in accordance with the European Embedded Value EEV principles.
The embedded value is the total of the net worth of the life business and the value of the in-force business.
The underlying methodology and assumptions have been reviewed by a rm of actuarial consultants and by the Groups auditors: New business contribution represents the present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written in a period.
This is based on business plans approved by management: Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based on managements best estimate of future growth.
The rate is in line with industry expectations: and Risk adjusted discount rate represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
The discount rate is a combination of a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years may differ from that assumed.
United Kingdom general insurance and health The recoverable amount of the United Kingdom general insurance and health unit has also been determined based on a value in use calculation.
The calculation uses cash ow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three year period and a risk adjusted discount rate of 10.45% 2004: 9.63%.
Cash ows beyond that three-year period have been extrapolated using a steady 3% growth rate 2004: 5%.
The recoverable amount signicantly exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and a reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause the carrying value of the cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Budgeted operating profit represents the operating profit in the business plans, approved by management and as such reect the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the UK general insurance industry.
Some of the assumptions that underline the budgeted operating profit include market share, premium rate changes, claims ination and commission rates.
Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate future cash ows beyond the business plan period and has been based upon latest information available regarding future and past growth rates.
The growth rate is considered to be consistent with both past experience and external sources of data ABI Annual Market Statistics.
RAC noninsurance operations The recoverable amount of the RAC non-insurance operations has also been determined based on a value in use calculation.
The calculation uses cash ow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three year period and a risk adjusted discount rate of 10.45%.
Cash ows beyond that three year period have been extrapolated using a steady 2% growth rate.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Budgeted operating profit represents the operating profit in the business plans, approved by management and as such reect the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth.
Some of the assumptions that underline the budgeted operating profit include market share, fee income and customer numbers.
Other During the year, goodwill allocated to a Life cash-generating unit in Germany was tested for impairment.
Following the impairment test, an impairment charge of 21 million has been recognised in the income statement.
The impairment charge arose as a result of the low interest rate environment in which the cash generating unit operates in and the further decline in interest rates during the year.
The recoverable amount for the cash-generating unit has been measured based on a value in use calculation.
A pre-tax discount rate of 6.75% was used in the value in use calculation and cash ows beyond the plan period have been extrapolated using a steady 4.85% growth rate.
The remaining 22 million related to other small European businesses.
The 2004 impairment charge of 41 million comprise 21 million on one non-insurance Dutch operation, 17 million on other small European businesses and 3 million on other operations.
