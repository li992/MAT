Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2005 1.
General information Mapeley Limited was registered in Guernsey on 26 April 2005 under the provisions of the Companies Guernsey Law, 1994 and issued two shares on incorporation.
On 2 June 2005, the Company issued 16,037,098 shares to the shareholders of Mapeley UK Co Limited MUKCO, the former parent company of the Group to acquire its issued share capital, assets, liabilities and business.
On 21 June 2005, through its initial public offering, the Company issued 6,121,739 ordinary shares to investors at a price of 23 each.
At the same time, the Company issued 291,308 ordinary shares under the Groups Employee Share Plan the Plan for employees and 5,000 ordinary shares each to J W Harris, R W Carey and C N K Parkinson in their capacity as Non-Executive Directors of the Company.
The shares issued under the Plan and to the Non-executive Directors were issued for nil consideration.
Amounts stated in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of changes in equity have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of merger accounting as set out below.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2005 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries and were authorised by the Board for issue on 10 March 2006.
The address of the Companys registered office is set out on page 93.
The principal activities of the Group are set out in the Introduction on page1.
2.1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted for use in the European Union IFRS and the Companies Guernsey Law 1994 on the historical cost basis, except for investment property, non-investment property held as part of property, plant and equipment, derivative financial instruments and available for sale financial assets that have been measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except where otherwise indicated.
The functional currency of the Group is pounds sterling.
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors have described below how, in preparing these financial statements, they have applied accounting standards as adopted for use in the EU under the first-time adoption provisions set out in IFRS 1 and the assumptions they have made about the standards and interpretations expected to be effective.
However, certain of the requirements and options in IFRS1 relating to comparative financial information presented on first time adoption may result in a different application of accounting policies in the 2005 comparative financial information to that which would apply if the 2005 financial statements were the first financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with accounting standards as adopted for use in the EU and, if there are subsequent changes to the Standards or Interpretations applicable to the 2006 financial statements, the 2005 financial information may require adjustment before constituting the comparative financial information to be included in those 2006 financial statements.
In the preparation of these financial statements the Group has adopted the following revised standards: IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements IAS 2 Inventories IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date IAS 12 Income Taxes IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment IAS 17 Leases IAS 18 Revenue IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation IAS 33 Earnings per Share IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 40 Investment Property IFRS 2 Share based payments IFRS 5 Non current assets held for sale and discontinued operations IFRIC 4 Determination whether an Arrangement contains a Lease The Directors have not taken advantage of any of the first time adoption exemptions available in IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of IFRS.
50 Mapeley Limited Annual report 2005 2.1 Basis of preparation continued The consolidated financial statements of Mapeley Limited have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.
In preparing annual financial statements, the accounting principles applied reflect the amendments to International Accounting Standards IAS and the adoption of the new IFRS which became effective from 1 January 2005.
Other than in respect of these changes, explained further below, the annual financial statements have been prepared under the same accounting principles and methods of computation as in the special purpose conversion financial statements prepared under IFRS for MUKCO for the year ended 31 December 2004 from which the comparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2004 have been extracted and adjusted as set out in the basis of consolidation below.
IFRS 2 Share-based payment IFRS 2 Share-based payment became effective from 1 January 2005 and has been applied to the preparation of these financial statements.
It requires an expense to be recognised where the Group receives goods or services in exchange for shares or rights over the shares of Mapeley Limited equity-settled transactions, or in exchange for other assets equivalent in value to a given number of shares of Mapeley Limited or rights over shares cash-settled transactions.
The main impact of IFRS 2 on the Group is the expensing of employees shares issued under the Groups employee share plan, shares issued and committed to be issued to Non-Executive Directors and other share-based incentives.
Straight line recognition of rental income under IAS 17 The Directors have followed the latest IFRIC announcement, in line with emerging best practice, clarifying the income and expense recognition profile of an operating lease in which the payments rise by a fixed annual percentage over the life of the lease.
Certain of the Groups outsourcing contracts provide for pre-determined uplifts in rental income.
The components of rents not contingent on future events have been recognised on a straight line basis over the life of the contracts.
Other components of rental income are recognised on a receivable basis.
Prior year comparatives Certain comparative figures have been adjusted or extended to conform to the presentation adopted in respect of the year ended 31 December 2005.
The adjustments are explained below: There has been a change in the definition of business segments.
Since presenting the special purpose financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004, the Directors have refined the definition of their business segments in accordance with the Groups strategy of placing a greater focus on acquiring outsourcing contracts and investment property.
In prior years financial statements the investment property segment was not sufficiently material to be presented separately.
The Directors consider the current years presentation to be better aligned to the Companys business model.
Further information on business segments is set out in note 3: The other change has been to adjust the earnings per share calculation to reflect the Group reorganisation during 2005 as further described in note 9: Trade and other receivables and trade and other payables have been reclassified between current and non-current assets and liabilities respectively.
The impact of this reclassification has increased non-current assets by 6.2 million current assets reduced by the same amount and increased non-current liabilities by 7.2 million current liabilities reduced by the same amount : Financial derivatives have been reclassified between current and non-current liabilities.
The impact of this reclassification has increased non-current liabilities by 63.6 million current liabilities reduced by the same amount : and Provisions have been reclassified between current and non-current liabilities.
The impact of this reclassification has increased current liabilities by 9.0 million non-current liabilities reduced by the same amount.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Mapeley Limited and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2005.
MUKCOs special purpose consolidated IFRS financial statements were prepared for the year ended 31 December 2004 in readiness for Listing on the London Stock Exchange.
The subsequent restructuring of the Group during the year involved a share for share exchange, which introduced a new holding company, Mapeley Limited.
At the time of reorganisation both companies were under common control.
The relative rights of the former shareholders of MUKCO were not altered and this restructuring has been accounted using the merger method of accounting, in line with guidance from UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP similar, principles based GAAP to IFRS.
UK FRS 6 Acquisition and Mergers states that the merger method of accounting on Group restructuring is allowable provided the relative rights of the shareholders were not altered.
This basis of consolidation has been adopted as best practice by the Group as no guidance currently exists on Group restructuring under IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Although Mapeley Limited was only formed on 26 April 2005 and acquired MUKCO on 2 June 2005, the accounting information, in line with the merger method of accounting, has been prepared as if the Group had always been in existence in its current form.
The prior year comparatives are accordingly presented with appropriate adjustments being made to the MUKCO special purpose consolidated financial statements to reflect the Groups reorganisation and its accounting in accordance with the merger method of accounting.
Mapeley Limited Annual report 2005 51 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements continued 2.1 Basis of preparation continued Except as noted above in connection with the formation of the Mapeley Limited group, subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred from the Group.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intra-group transactions are eliminated as part of the consolidation process.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of Mapeley Limited have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.
This is consistent with IFRS as adopted for use in the EU as it applies to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2005.
In preparing the annual financial statements, the accounting principles applied reflect the amendments to IFRS and the adoption of those new IFRS which have become effective since 1 January 2005.
2.2 Summary of significant accounting policies Revenue Revenue recognised in the income statement represents amounts receivable in respect of contractual income, property rental income, other property and trading activity and interest income earned in the normal course of business, net of VAT and other sales-related taxes, as follows: Contractual revenue The Groups gross contractual revenue comprises income earned by its property outsourcing businesses, and rentals and service charges received from tenants.
Contracts entered into under the UK governments private finance initiative PFI scheme are unbundled, either at inception or on any reassessment of the arrangement.
Income from the embedded leases, principally contractual and third party rents, is distinguished from income from the other contract elements.
Amounts receivable under PFI contracts in respect of the provision of property to customers are treated in accordance with the provisions of IAS 17 Leases with the minimum lease payments being spread on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
However, the cost and revenue profiles of the portion of the contract concerned with the provision of property related services are treated as arising from service contracts in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue.
Income from service contracts is recognised and accounted for according to the stage reached in the contract by reference to the value of work completed.
An appropriate estimate of the profit attributable to the work undertaken is recognised once the outcome of the contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
In addition to service charges, as part of the property outsourcing contract, the Group is also responsible for procuring certain additional goods and services supplied to its customers.
The direct costs of supplying these goods are invoiced to the Group and recharged to customers in full.
As the Group receives a pre-determined fee for managing such activity on behalf of its customers and the risks in relation to the provision of these goods and services are primarily borne by the Groups customers, revenue for this activity recorded by the Group comprises the net income earned by the Group from this activity in each financial reporting period.
Property trading income Income earned from property trading consists of proceeds from the sale of trading properties.
Sales are recognised on completion of sale contracts.
Interest income Interest income is the interest earned on cash held in bank accounts and is recognised in the accounts on an accruals basis.
Rental income receivable under operating leases Rental income receivable under operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, except for contingent income which is recognised when it arises.
Incentives for lessees to enter into lease agreements are spread evenly over the non-cancellable period of the lease, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Premiums received to amend or terminate leases are recognised in the income statement when they arise.
Rentals payable under operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term or the period to the first break, if shorter.
Incentives given by lessors to enter into lease agreements, including asset management receipts, are spread evenly over the shorter of the lease term or the period to the first break as a reduction of rental expense, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Premiums paid to amend or terminate leases are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Investment property Freehold property held to earn rent or for capital appreciation or both is classified as investment property in accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property.
Property held under finance leases for similar purposes is also classified as investment property.
Investment property is measured initially at cost, including transaction costs, and thereafter is stated at fair value, which reflects market conditions at the balance sheet date.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment property are included in the income statement in the year in which they arise.
52 5 52 2 Mapeley Limited Annual report 2005 2.2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property Where the Group provides significant levels of ancillary services to the occupiers of its property, this property is not classified as investment property.
Such freehold property and property held under finance leases are revalued to fair value annually and depreciated in accordance with IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment.
Surpluses or deficits on individual properties are transferred to the revaluation reserve, except that deficits including impairment adjustments below historical cost are taken to the income statement.
Any revaluation surplus is credited to the revaluation reserve in equity except to the extent that it reverses a decrease in the carrying value of the same asset previously recognised in the income statement, in which case the increase is recognised in the income statement.
A revaluation deficit is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent of any existing surplus in respect of that asset in the revaluation reserve.
A transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to retained earnings for the difference between depreciation based on the carrying amount of the assets and that based on the assets original cost.
Additionally, accumulated deprecation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.
Upon disposal any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings.
Plant and equipment Plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and any additional provision for impairment which may be required.
Premiums on operating leases Premiums on operating leases are stated at cost less amortisation and any additional provision for impairment which may be required.
Depreciation and amortisation Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less the estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life.
Buildings are classified according to their condition and date of construction, and are depreciated over periods between 20 and 50 years according to this classification.
Buildings held under finance leases are depreciated over the terms of the leases if shorter.
Premiums paid for operating leases are amortised on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease terms.
Plant and equipment, excluding information systems equipment, are depreciated over four years.
Information systems equipment, including computer equipment and telecommunications apparatus is depreciated over two to four years.
No depreciation charge is applied to land.
The useful economic life and residual values of all property, plant and equipment is reassessed annually.
Acquisitions of corporate interests in property Acquisitions of corporate interests in property are accounted for on consolidation as if the Group had acquired the underlying property directly.
Accordingly, no goodwill arises on such acquisitions.
Any difference between the fair values of the property and the acquisition consideration are allocated to the investment property asset, which is subject to subsequent revaluation to its market value under IAS 40 Investment Property.
Non-current assets held for sale Items of property, plant and equipment are transferred to non-current assets held for sale when it is expected that their carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than from continuing use in the business in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale.
On re-classification, depreciation of the assets ceases even if the assets are still being used by the Group, and each asset is carried at the lower of its previous carrying value and fair value less expected costs of sale.
Any impairment adjustment below historical cost is charged to the income statement.
Finance leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a finance lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged to the income statement as they arise.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.
If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows of the asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Mapeley Limited Annual report 2005 53 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements continued 2.2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the income statement unless the asset is carried at revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.
After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Inventories Trading property Property acquired and held with the intention of being sold, is included in inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value, being the market value less expected costs of sale.
Work in progress The costs of service contracts not yet taken to the income statement, less any foreseeable losses and payments on account, are shown within inventories as work in progress.
Asset management receipts Asset management receipts, which represent premiums given by lessors in return for the Group extending its existing lease terms or removing break clauses from existing leases, are deferred and released as a credit to operating costs evenly over the shorter of the lease term and the first break, even if payments are not made on such a basis.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Cash and short-term deposits Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank, short-term deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Derecognition of financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
Provisions Provision is made in respect of costs incurred on vacant leasehold properties or for leasehold properties sublet at a level which renders the properties loss-making over the length of the lease, being the net cash outflow committed to be incurred over the lives of the leases.
The cash flows for each such lease are discounted back to the balance sheet date, representing the Groups best estimate of the impact of the time value of money and the risks inherent in its obligations.
Any increase or decrease in the provision is taken to the income statement each financial period.
The unwinding of the discount in the provision is charged to the income statement each year within finance costs.
The basis of the provision, the discount rate applied and amounts provided are reviewed semi-annually.
Share-based payments The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which shares are granted.
Fair value, in the case of shares issued at the date of the Companys IPO, is the offer price.
Fair value at all other dates is determined as the bid price quoted on the London Stock Exchange at the date of the grant.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award the vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired.
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
54 Mapeley Limited Annual report 2005 2.2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, the expense recognised in the income statement is reversed, as if it had not vested on the date of cancellation.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
Treasury shares Treasury shares acquired are deducted from equity at their cost of acquisition.
Share premium Costs related to the issue of ordinary shares are charged against share premium.
Financial instruments Interest and non-interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration received less directly attributable transactions costs.
After initial recognition, interest and non-interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised in finance income and finance expense respectively.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date at which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Fair value for a swap is market value, as determined by a break cost quote prepared by an experienced, independent broker, which is estimated by applying current yields to anticipated future cash flows.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income statement for the year.
For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in equity under net unrealised gains or losses.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the year.
Current taxation Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
The Company is a limited company registered in Guernsey, Channel Islands and is not subject to local taxation.
Certain Group undertakings are subject to foreign taxes in respect of foreign source income, including UK income tax on rental income within UK Group undertakings.
Mapeley Limited Annual report 2005 55 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements continued 2.2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Deferred taxation Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax is recognised for all temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Retirement benefit schemes The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme.
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benefits is the contributions payable for the year.
Differences between contributions payable for the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
IFRS issued but not yet effective The Group has not adopted the following standards in the preparation of financial statements as they were not effective at 31 December 2005: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures IAS 1 Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures IAS 19 Amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures IAS 39 Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement The Fair Value Option IAS 39 Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement Cash Flow Hedge Accounting of Forecast Intragroup Transactions IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives 3.
Revenue and segmental information The Directors continue to keep the accounting polices and presentation of the financial statements under review as required by IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors.
Since presenting the special purpose financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004, the Directors have refined the definition of their business segments in accordance with the strategy of acquiring property related outsourcing contracts and investment property not acquired under outsourcing contracts.
The effect of the investment property segment was not material enough to be presented separately in previous years accounts.
The Directors now consider this presentation to be more aligned to the Companys business model.
The segments are described below: Outsourcing contracts This segment consists of activities arising from the sale and subsequent leaseback of the HMRC and Abbey property portfolios.
The main characteristics of these arrangements are listed below: long-term contracts both contracts run over a period of 20 years : agreements are tailored in accordance with the clients accommodation requirements from simple purchase and lease back to fully serviced accommodation : 56 Mapeley Limited Annual report 2005 3.
Revenue and segmental information continued the agreements allow HMRC and Abbey to exercise flexibility to vacate properties within defined parameters: and the revenue earned is subject to annual increases.
Investment property The Group has embarked on a separate strategy of acquiring individual and portfolios of office property.
The Groups activities within this segment will focus on purchasing property primarily let to strong credit quality tenants, who are likely to stay in the properties for a minimum term of five years.
The segments previously reported as Property investment and Outsourcing contracts have been merged to become the Outsourcing contracts segment with the small amount of investment property held at 31 December 2004 and reported in the former Property investment segment being reported in the Investment property segment at 31 December 2005.
The effect of redefining business segments resulted in revenue derived from the Outsourcing contracts segment in 2005 increasing by 93.0 million, Segment Result increasing by 80.3 million at 31 December 2005, segment assets increasing by 579.3 million and segment liabilities increasing by 75.4 million, with a corresponding decrease on the Property investment segment, which is now reported within the Investment property segment.
Segment information for 2004 has been restated accordingly.
The Group has a single geographical segment, being the UK commercial property market.

The share benefit expense also includes a charge of 805,000 which relates to a share benefit expense for four Non-Executive Directors who were each awarded 15,000 ordinary shares during the year 2004: nil.
The Group established its Employee Share Plan the Plan during the year, which replaced the Groups Leveraged Co-investment Plan LCIP and Performance Option Plan, both of which were wound up during 2004.
On the Groups admission to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange on 21 June 2005, 291,308 ordinary shares were granted and issued in the names of Plan members subject to certain vesting conditions.
At 31 December 2005, 1,460 shares had been returned to the Company on withdrawal of members from the Plan and are held as treasury shares.
Vesting takes place over periods of up to five years from the date of issue and is conditional on employees remaining in employment: there are no performance conditions.
During the vesting period, the participants receive dividends and the shares may be sold, but the proceeds of any sale are subject to the same vesting terms as the shares.
The total cost to the Group of shares issued under the Plan during the year ended 31 December 2005 of 6,700,000 is to be spread over the relevant vesting periods: 30% will vest on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of admission and the remaining 40% will vest on the last business day before the fifth anniversary of admission.
Shares awarded to Non-Executive Directors vest on the date of grant and after each of the first two annual general meetings following the date of appointment.
The total cost to the Group of shares issued or granted to Non-Executive Directors during the year ended 31 December 2005 of 1,438,000 is to be spread over the relevant vesting periods, being one third on grant, one third over the period to the first annual general meeting and one third over the period to the second annual general meeting.

The Group incurred an exceptional loss in 2005 on refinancing certain borrowings comprising the following amounts which are included above.
000 Loss on breaking interest rate swap 63,880 Loan termination costs 2,051 Accelerated amortisation of loan finance fees included in finance costs on bank loans and overdrafts 6,800 72,731 Since the swap arrangements were entered into, interest rates have changed and consequently an exceptional cost of 63,880,000 was incurred in breaking these agreements which was charged to the income statement in the year ended 31 December 2005.
The Group also incurred termination costs of 2,051,000 in breaking the existing loan, which was charged in the same period.
Accelerated amortisation of loan finance fees comprises accelerated amortisation charges of 6,800,000 in respect of loan finance fees on certain of the Groups borrowings.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, unamortised loan finance fees at 31 December 2004, incurred in connection with those terminated borrowings, have been charged over the period from 31 December 2004 to the expected revised date of repayment of the borrowings.
Income tax expense No income tax is chargeable to the income statement or the statement of changes in equity in the current year in respect of Guernsey, UK or other overseas taxation.
The major components of income tax for the years ended 31 December 2005 and 2004 are: a Tax on profit on ordinary activities 2005 2004 000 000 Tax charged in the income statement Current income tax Guernsey income tax UK income tax Other overseas tax Current income tax charge Amounts overprovided in previous years Total current income tax Mapeley Limited Annual report 2005 61 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements continued 7.

This has been calculated by dividing 1 Group companies profits before tax multiplied by the tax rate applicable for each Group company by 2 the Groups profit before tax.
c Deferred income tax The Group has tax losses arising in 2005 that would be available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose.
The Group has not recognised any deferred income tax asset as the Directors do not consider there is sufficient certainty in the timing and amount of future taxable profits that would allow reversal of the asset arising in the relevant Group companies.
The unrecognised deferred tax asset balances are as follows: 2005 2004 000 000 Revaluation of interest rate swaps to fair value 6,687 15,266 Losses not utilised 34,479 23,071 Decelerated capital allowances 3,240 5,025 Movement in the provision for onerous leases 3,461 2,704 Movement in the deferral of asset management receipts 17,741 15,751 Other temporary differences 1,736 1,440 Deferred tax asset recoverable in the event of sale of revalued properties at market value 48 Total unrecognised deferred tax asset balance 67,296 63,257 There would be no material tax liability if the Groups properties were to be sold at the valuation at which they are stated in the balance sheet.
Dividends paid and proposed Between incorporation and 31 December 2005, the following dividends were declared and paid: 2005 000 Equity dividends on ordinary shares: First interim dividend for 2005: 0.30 per share 4,615 Second interim dividend for 2005: 0.27 per share 4,275 Third interim dividend for 2005: 0.03 per share 748 Fourth interim dividend for 2005: 0.33 per share 7,414 17,052 The first interim dividend was paid by MUKCO prior to the Group reorganisation on 2 June 2005 following which Mapeley Limited became the parent company of the Group.
Proposed and approved at the Board meeting on 5 January 2006 To be deducted from retained earnings in the year ending 31 December 2006 2005 000 Equity dividends on ordinary shares: Fifth interim dividend for 2005: 0.37 per share 8,312 No dividends were declared, proposed or paid during the year ended 31 December 2004.
Loss earnings per share The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share figures is based on the following: Net loss attributable to equity holders of the Company for the year of 56.5 million year ended 31 December 2004: profit of 43.3 million : Weighted average number of ordinary shares after deducting 1,460 treasury shares relinquished by members of the employee share plan during the year for basic earnings per share 19,510,770 year ended 31 December 2004: 15,100,000 : Weighted average number of ordinary shares after deducting 1,460 treasury shares relinquished by members of the employee share plan during the year for diluted earnings per share 19,527,249 year ended 31 December 2004: 15,322,600.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares for the year ended 31 December 2004 has been restated to reflect the share for share exchange that took place on 2 June 2005, in which existing shareholders were offered 100 ordinary shares in the Company for each share held in MUKCO.
The effect of this was to reduce the basic earnings per share from 287.0 per share to 2.9 per share and diluted earnings per share from 283.0 per share to 2.8 per share.

During the year, certain of the Groups non-investment properties have been written down by an amount of 589,000.
The impairment adjustment has been charged to the current years income statement reflecting the amount of the impairment below their historical cost values.
Freehold property held at 31 December 2005 of 487,271,000 2004: 471,204,000 and the majority of the property acquired under finance leases at 31 December 2005 of 37,660,000 2004: 36,510,000 were valued at 31 December 2005 by Savills Commercial Limited Savills, a valuer external to the Group as part of the valuation of all the valuable properties held by the Group under the HMRC contract.
These valuations have been incorporated into the annual financial statements.
Savills have consented to the use of their name in these financial statements.
The total of this valuation at 31 December 2005 was 566,613,000 2004: 546,720,000 and an analysis of where the assets valued are recorded in the financial statements shown in the table below: 31 December 18 April 2005 2005 000 000 Freehold property 487,271 471,204 Property acquired under finance leases 37,660 36,510 Recorded in property, plant and equipment 524,931 507,714 Properties held within premiums on operating leases 38,628 39,006 Properties held as non-current assets held for sale 3,054 Total valuation of the Groups assets valued by Savills 566,613 546,720 Long leasehold properties with a valuation of 38,628,000 2004: 39,006,000 are classified as Premiums on operating leases and are recorded at historical cost less amortisation see note 12.
Five properties with a valuation of 3,054,000 2004: nil became vacant during the year and are being actively marketed for sale in 2006.
These have been re-classified as non-current assets held for sale in 2005.
The valuations at 31 December 2004 were undertaken by Savills at 18 April 2005 on a basis consistent with that applied at 31 December 2005.
The Directors, having taken advice from a suitably qualified employee a member of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, were of the opinion that the value of these properties at 31 December 2004 was not materially different from that at 18 April 2005 and therefore incorporated those valuations prepared by Savills at 18 April 2005 in the balance sheet at 31 December 2004.
"Property, plant and equipment continued The valuation at 31 December 2005 has been carried out in accordance with The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards published in February 2003 the ""Red Book"" and the CESR Guidance on property valuations."
The valuation as at 31 December 2004 was carried out using the discounted cash flow method of valuation.
Under this method the estimated future income stream from each property and the estimated residual value of each property have been capitalised at appropriate discount rates that reflect the tenure, location, age, size and quality of buildings, the terms of the outsourcing contract and the potential risk that some of the properties may fall vacant either during or at the end of the contract.
"The valuations have been prepared in accordance with the Red Book on the basis of Market Value, which is defined as follows: ""The estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion. """
The following assumptions were used in determining the valuations which were specific to the Group: For the purpose of the valuations, each Property has been valued individually and not as part of a portfolio notwithstanding the overriding terms of the Groups contract with HMRC and the non-assignable nature of this contract.
The valuations assume that the contract is freely assignable in the open market.
No allowances have been made for any expenses of realisation nor for taxation which might arise in the event of a disposal of a Property.
The valuations are, however, net of acquisition costs if any.
Purchasers costs have been deducted in arriving at the valuations.
These are based on 1% agents fees, 0.5% legal fees fees include VAT at 17.5% and stamp duty land tax at the relevant rate, dependent upon the value of each property.
Under the terms of the contract with HMRC, it is entitled to bring a proportion of its leases to an end earlier than the 20 year term and vacate the premises subject to i 12 months notice: and ii agreed limits on the amount and type of space that can be vacated each year.
The valuations assumed a hypothetical weighted average lease term for the leases with HMRC to reflect these termination rights, and taking into account HMRCs stated intentions.
These hypothetical weighted average lease terms are as follows: Properties designated Core by the HMRC contractleased until 31 March 2021: Properties designated Intermediate by the HMRC contractleased until the contractual lease expiry date: and Properties designated Flexible by the HMRC contractleased until 30 September 2011.
HMRC pays the Group amounts under the contract which cover the charge for both the accommodation provided and the related services.
The payment is subject to deductions for failures to meet specified performance standards and unavailability for use.
Services provided to HMRC include maintenance, lifecycle replacement, cleaning, help desk, security, catering, childcare, health and safety, utilities, equipment management, churn, vending and landscaping.
The valuations rely upon the Group for its assessment of the cost of providing these services, the level of deductions and how they will vary over time.
The valuations have been carried out by taking account of the benefit of the contract with HMRC and the various occupational leases and the subsequent sale of the Property at expiry of these arrangements.
In assessing the future sales proceeds, Savills have estimated the current vacant possession value of the properties and assumed that these decline in real terms at rates between 0.5% and 1.25% per annum.
In order to arrive at their valuation, Savills discounted net annual rents receivable at a weighted average rate of 6.3% and residual sales values were discounted at a weighted average rate of 10.4%.
Certain other properties held under finance leases and included within property, plant and equipment were valued in accordance with the Red Book by the Directors at a Market Value of 2,430,000 2004: 3,644,000 having taken advice from a suitably-qualified employee a member of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The valuations for the finance leases were determined by: taking into account the estimated future income stream from each property: and using appropriate discount rates that reflect the incremental borrowing rate of the Group at the time the leases were taken out, being 7.5% 2004: 9%.
Mapeley Limited Annual report 2005 65 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements continued 10.
Property, plant and equipment continued If freehold property and property acquired under finance leases were measured using the historical cost model, the carrying amounts would be as follows: 2005 2004 000 000 Freehold Cost 190,842 192,465 Accumulated depreciation 3,198 2,696 Net book value 187,644 189,769 Acquired under finance leases Cost 23,736 23,672 Accumulated depreciation 2,286 997 Net book value 21,450 22,675 All leased assets are pledged as security for the related finance lease obligation.

Investment property was valued at 31 December 2005 by CB Richard Ellis Limited CBRE and Savills, valuers external to the Group.
Both Savills and CBRE have consented to the use of their names in these financial statements.
Investment property comprises the Groups Abbey portfolio and its direct property investments.
CBREs valuation of the Abbey portfolio of properties was 546,503,000 2004: 526,054,000.
Certain properties with a valuation of 1,841,000 2004: 1,732,000 included within this valuation are being marketed for sale and as such are classified as trading properties within inventories.
These are carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value in the financial statements see note 14.
Savills and CBRE both carried out valuations of the Groups other properties held within investment property, which were valued at 24,825,000 2004: nil, and 504,399,000 2004: 24,350,000 respectively as at 31 December 2005.
The remaining properties held under Property acquired under finance leases were valued by the Directors at a Market Value of 3,543,000 2004: nil, having taken advice from a suitably-qualified employee a member of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.

The Directors, having taken advice from a suitably-qualified employee a member of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, were of the opinion that the value of these properties at 31 December 2004 was not materially different from that at 18 April 2005 and, therefore incorporated those valuations prepared by CBRE at 18 April 2005 in the balance sheet at 31 December 2004.
"The valuations at 31 December 2005 and 2004 have been carried out in accordance with The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards published in February 2003 the ""Red Book"" and the CESR Guidance on property valuations."
The valuations have been prepared in accordance with the Red Book on the basis of Market Value, which is set out in note 10.
Certain properties acquired under finance leases for which the unexpired term became less than 20 years during the year ended 31 December 2005 were reclassified to premiums paid on operating leases as set out in the accounting policies.
The following assumptions were used in determining the valuations which were specific to the Group: No allowances have been made for any expenses of realisation or for taxation which might arise in the event of a disposal of a property.
Purchasers costs have been deducted in arriving at our valuations.
The valuations have been undertaken assuming except as otherwise disclosed to us that in the case of the Abbey properties, each property is subject to a standard-form lease agreed between the Group and Abbey and that these leases commenced on 1 January 2001 without options to break on the part of either the tenant or the landlord.
There are overriding provisions for Abbey to terminate occupational leases earlier than the original lease end date.
These are set out within a master agreement entered into with Abbey.
In the case of the DPI properties, the valuation for each of the properties has been undertaken determined by the specific term of the individual leases.
Abbeys ability to exercise its right to end leases and vacate property early is constrained by the fact that the aggregate rent payable by Abbey in the following years of the master agreements 20 year term cannot fall below the following percentages of the projected aggregate rents for those years: Years 5 to 6 95% Years 7 to 11 85% Years 12 to 15 80% Years 16 to 20 90% Constraints over the remaining investment properties are determined by the specific term of the individual leases.
Mapeley Limited Annual report 2005 67 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements continued 11.
Investment property continued In return for the flexibility in the Abbey portfolio there are compensation mechanisms provided within the master agreement which are intended broadly to leave the Group in a neutral position.
Whilst invariably the computation on a property by property basis may result in some properties being under compensated or vice versa, the valuations consider that overall the position is indeed likely to remain neutral.
It should also be noted that the rental increments broadly hold the rental flow at a similar level even on the presupposition that Abbey exercises maximum flexibility.
The Directors valued certain finance leases at 31 December 2005, having taken advice from a suitably-qualified employee a member of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, on the following basis: taking into account the estimated future income stream from each property: and using appropriate discount rates that reflect the incremental borrowing rate of the Group at the time the leases were taken out, being 7.5%.

These properties are being actively marketed and it is anticipated that these disposals will take place in 2006.
In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 5, these assets are held at the lower of carrying value and fair value less estimated disposal costs.
As a result of this reclassification these assets were written down by 255,000.

On 2 June 2005, the Company issued 16,037,098 ordinary shares to the shareholders of MUKCO to acquire its issued share capital.
These shares have been treated in these accounts as if they had always been in existence, consistent with the principles of merger accounting.
On 21 June 2005, through its initial public offering, the Company issued a further 6,121,739 ordinary shares to investors at a price of 23 each.
At the same time, the Company issued 291,308 ordinary shares under the share Plan for employees and 5,000 ordinary shares each to J W Harris, R W Carey and C N K Parkinson in their capacity as Non-Executive Directors of the Company.
The Company also awarded 5,000 ordinary shares to M Fascitelli who was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 20 December 2005.
These shares will be issued to M Fascitelli in 2006.
The ordinary shares issued to the Employee Share Plan and to the Non-Executive Directors were issued for nil consideration.
Ordinary shares have no restrictions attached and entitle all shareholders one vote for each share held and to the assets of the Company on any winding up after settlement of all liabilities.
The restructuring of the Group during the year involved a share for share exchange, which introduced a new holding company, Mapeley Limited.
The relative rights of the former shareholders of MUKCO were not altered and this restructuring has been accounted for using the merger method of accounting.
Although Mapeley Limited was only formed on 26 April 2005 and acquired MUKCO on 2 June 2005, the accounting information on the Group has been prepared as if the Group had always been in existence in its current form.
At 31 December 2005, 1,460 shares had been returned to the Group following withdrawal of members from the Plan.
These shares are held by a subsidiary as treasury shares.
Issued capital and reserves continued Share premium Share premium represents the excess of proceeds raised on the issue of shares over the nominal value of those shares.
Costs incurred in issuing shares of 8,411,000 have been deducted from share premium during the year from both the Company and the Group.
Net unrealised losses This reserve records movements in the fair value of financial instruments held as cash flow hedges.
Asset revaluation reserve The asset revaluation reserve is used to record increases in the fair value of non-investment properties and decreases to the extent that such decrease relates to an increase on the same asset previously recognised in equity.
Any decrease below historical costs is recognised in the income statement.
Other reserves Other reserves include contributed surplus, capital contribution and share benefit expense.
Contributed surplus and capital contribution The contributed surplus and capital contribution of MUKCO were reclassified as other reserves as part of the Group restructuring which occurred during the year.
This involved a share for share exchange with shareholders of MUKCO, which introduced a new holding company, Mapeley Limited.
The contributed surplus represents the excess of proceeds raised on the issue of shares over the nominal value of those shares.
During the year, 29.0 million of contributed surplus was repaid to the shareholders.
The capital contribution was an irrevocable offer to contribute capital on demand made by the shareholders of MUKCO in 2002.
This contribution was called and received during the year.
Share benefit expense Other reserves include a credit of 899,000 for the year ended 31 December 2005 in respect of shares issued under the Plan and charged to the income statement.
The total estimated cost to the Group of 6,700,000 is to be spread over the relevant vesting periods.
Other reserves also include a credit of 805,000 which relates to a share benefit expense for shares issued to the four Non-Executive Directors and charged to the income statement.
These Directors were each awarded 15,000 shares during the year and vest on dates ranging between the date of grant and the second AGM following the date of appointment to the Board.
The total estimated cost to the Group is spread over the periods from the date of grant to the date at which the benefits vest.
Further details are set out in note 5.

The loan balances above represent the amounts outstanding at 31 December on the following facilities: Term loan under the HMRC portfolio facility The HMRC portfolio has an existing 20 year, 190.0 million loan facility in place.
Of this amount, 177.3 million was drawn down at 31 December 2005 2004: 179.3 million.
The amount drawn down is divided into two categories, Tranche A and Tranche B.
Interest on Tranche A is set at LIBOR plus 0.85% plus mandatory costs if any and on Tranche B at LIBOR plus 1.0% plus mandatory costs if any.
Interest on both tranches is paid twice a year.
The Tranche A capital repayments are made twice a year at rates calculated to repay the whole of the original loan by 2021.
The Tranche B loan is only repaid when properties within the portfolio are sold.
Any unpaid loan outstanding at expiry in 2021 will be repaid in full at that time.
This bank loan is secured against all freehold and long leasehold properties held in the HMRC portfolio and by a charge over the investments of Mapeley STEPS Holdings Limited.
New term loan under the Abbey portfolio facility The Group refinanced its existing loan facility in relation to the Abbey portfolio on 30 June 2005, replacing its 18 year, 465.0 million loan with a seven year, 455.0 million fully drawn down loan facility.
This bank loan is secured against all investment property held in the Abbey portfolio and by a charge over the investments of Mapeley Columbus Holdings Limited.
Interest on the loan is paid quarterly at a rate of LIBOR plus 0.95% plus mandatory costs if any.
The borrowers have entered into separate fixed interest rate agreements to fix the interest payable.
The loan is only partly repaid when properties within the portfolio are sold.
Any unpaid loan balance outstanding at expiry will be repaid in full at that time.
Acquisition facility During the year the Group terminated its three year, 200.0 million acquisition facility replacing it with a 10 year, 175.0 million investment facility set out below.
The amount drawn down as at 31 December 2004 was 25.7 million.
Investment facility A 10 year, 175.0 million investment facility was arranged during the year to refinance the Groups acquisition facility secured on certain of the Group properties.
At 31 December 2005, 170.9 million was drawn down under this facility.
The interest rate payable on the facility is fixed at 4.95% plus 0.75% plus mandatory costs if any.
When the assets funded by the facility were initially purchased, the Directors entered into swap arrangements to fix the rate of interest payable.
Once all assets had been purchased, the acquisition facility and related SWAP arrangements were terminated and the rate payable under the investment facility which replaced it, determined by the weighted average rate payable under the Groups matching SWAP contracts which were also terminated at that date.
Each borrower under this facility has granted security over all its assets in favour of the lender.
The loan is partly repaid when properties within the portfolio are sold.
Revolving acquisition facility During the year, a three year, 300.0 million revolving acquisition facility was arranged to finance the acquisition of investment property.
Of this amount, 283.4 million was drawn down at 31 December 2005.
The remainder of this facility will be drawn down as further investment property is acquired.
The interest rate payable on the facility is LIBOR plus 1.5% plus mandatory costs if any.
As a condition precedent to drawing any advances, each borrower is required to grant security over all its assets and shares in favour of a security trustee.
The borrowers obligations are guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries.
The loan is repayable in full at the end of the term.
Interest and non-interest bearing loans and borrowings continued All of the Groups floating-rate loans have been hedged using interest rate swaps, to make them equivalent to fixed-rate loans in substance.
Not all interest rate swaps have been hedge accounted.

Shareholder loans Information on shareholder loans is set out in note 27.
Finance leases Certain of the Groups investment properties, properties held within property, plant and equipment and properties held under short-term leases are accounted for as finance leases.
These leases have no terms of renewal or purchase options or escalation clauses other than periodic reviews to increase rents payable to market rates as required.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases together with the present value of the net minimum lease payments are as follows: 2005 2005 2004 2004 Minimum PV of Minimum PV of payments payments payments payments 000 000 000 000 Within one year 607 578 558 529 After one year but not more than five years 2,271 1,767 1,844 1,410 More than five years 29,072 3,935 16,735 2,727 Total minimum lease payments 31,950 6,280 19,137 4,666 Less: amounts representing finance charges 25,670 14,471 Present value of minimum lease payments 6,280 4,666 Rental payments on finance leases in excess of these minimum payments Contingent rents are expensed in the year in which they are incurred and amounted to 40,000 in the year ended 31 December 2005 2004: 25,000.

Accruals and deferred income include an amount of 33,907,000 2004: 30,913,000 in respect of deferred income 22.
Pension costs The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme.
The pension charge for the year amounted to 199,000 2004: 243,000.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund.
The Group does not operate any defined benefit schemes.
Commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments Group as lessee The Group leases a number of commercial properties under operating leases.
Typically the leases provide for upwards-only rent reviews during the lease term and last 20 years from inception.
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December analysed by the period in which they fall due are as follows: 2005 2004 000 000 Less than one year 162,492 166,081 Between one and five years 573,916 587,833 More than five years 776,559 836,820 1,512,967 1,590,734 Operating lease commitmentsGroup as lessor The Groups portfolio of receivable operating leases comprises a block of leases purchased in December 2000, together with another block of leases, embedded within outsourcing contracts purchased in 2001 which also provide for the supply of other property-related services, and some subsequent additions.
These leases are non-cancellable and have remaining lease terms of up to 20 years.
The Groups leases typically include a clause either to enable upward revision of the rental charge on an annual basis based on prevailing market conditions or a fixed annual uplift of 3% or RPI and provide for the lessee to pay all insurance, maintenance and repair costs.
Future minimum rentals receivable under other non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December, analysed by the period in which they fall due are as follows: 2005 2004 000 000 Less than one year 135,543 99,116 Between one and five years 474,152 379,287 More than five years 828,179 858,346 1,437,874 1,336,749 Income from operating leases embedded in the Groups outsourcing contracts entered into under the UK governments PFI scheme are not included in the above table.
Minimum payments cannot be established with certainty under the terms of the contract as the contract provides for flexibility for the government to relinquish space and consequently demand and revenue are uncertain.
Total future minimum sub-lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sub-leases in respect of properties acquired under finance leases at 31 December 2005 were 46,328,000 2004: 13,336,000.
Where a premium was paid on properties held under operating leases, the premiums are carried at their purchase cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over the remaining minimum lease term within premiums on operating leases see note 12.
Capital commitments 2005 2004 000 000 At 31 December, the Group had the following commitments: Contracted but not provided 366 600 On 20 December 2005, M Fascitelli was appointed a Non-Executive Director of the Company and was awarded 5,000 shares which will be issued in 2006.
The Company is also committed to issue a further 5,000 shares to each independent Non-Executive Directors still holding office at the conclusion of the first and second AGMs following their dates of appointment.
Mapeley Limited Annual report 2005 75 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements continued 24.
Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, finance leases and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Groups property portfolio.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group has also entered into interest rate swap agreements in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements with its principal providers of finance.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Groups sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in note 2.2.
The Group also monitors the market price risk arising from all financial instruments.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.
The Groups policy is to keep 100% of its long-term borrowings at fixed rates of interest except for debt raised for direct property investment, where property acquired is initially funded on a short-term basis before being refinanced through long-term borrowing facilities.
A target gearing ratio of 70%75% has been set for these long-term borrowings on direct property investments.
To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Group enters into interest rate swaps on the date an asset is purchased under which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount expected to be equivalent to the related long-term borrowings to be used to finance the asset on its refinancing.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
At 31 December 2005, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, substantially all of the Groups non-current borrowings were at a fixed rate of interest.
Credit risk The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debt is not significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from any default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
A significant proportion of the Groups total income is earned from the Groups two contracts.
The contractual parties have either AAA or A credit ratings and no major credit risk is currently considered to exist.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of its overdraft facilities.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by working capital facilities totalling 55.0 million 2004: 30.0 million of which 30.0 million is available to the Group for draw down until 7 April 2021 and 25.0 million is available until 30 June 2006 with an option to extend for a further two years.
In addition, at 31 December 2005, the Group had a 300.0 million 2004: nil capital expenditure facility of which 283.4 million 2004: nil was drawn down.
In addition, the Group has drawn, long-term secured facilities totalling 803.2 million 2004: 670.0 million.
Financial instruments Certain of the Groups bank debt is subject to floating interest rates, the majority of which has been exchanged for fixed interest rates under interest rate exchange agreements.
The Groups criteria for an interest rate swap are that the instrument must be related to an asset or a liability and that it must change the character of the interest rate by converting a floating rate to a fixed rate or vice versa.
Interest rate swaps are revalued to fair value and shown on the Group balance sheet at the year end.
The fair value for a swap is market value, estimated using a break cost quote from an experienced, independent broker, which is estimated by applying current yields to anticipated future cash flows.
The key assumptions used in the swap valuations are listed below: The mid-market rate is used for the valuations: The valuations represent the Net Present Value of the cash flows from the valuation date until expiry of the instrument at the contracted rate and at the valuation rate: and The valuation rate is compiled from prevailing market futures rates and swap rates on the date of the valuation.
Fair values Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the Groups financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements.
The fair value of financial derivatives and borrowings has been calculated by discounting the future cash flows at prevailing market interest rates.

Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.

Related party disclosures Identity of related parties Transactions between the parent company and its subsidiaries are eliminated in these consolidated financial statements.
A list of the main subsidiaries is provided in note 26.
Transactions with shareholders and Directors are shown separately below.
Parent and control The Directors regard Fortress Investment Trust II and Fortress Registered Investment Trust, both registered in the USA, as the Companys ultimate controlling parties.
Compensation of key management personnel Emoluments for key UK management employed by a subsidiary, Mapeley Estates Limited, are set out below: 2005 2004 000 000 Short-term employee benefits 822 1,328 Post-employment benefits 42 52 Termination benefits 421 Share-based payment 337 1,201 1,801 Directors compensation Emoluments for Directors of the Group are set out below: 2005 2004 000 000 Short-term employee benefits 466 402 Post-employment benefits 18 18 Share-based payment 1,075 1,559 420 Group reorganisation During the year and prior to its acquisition by Mapeley Limited, MUKCO, sold the shares of three subsidiaries, Mapeley Milton Keynes Limited, Willen Lake Limited and Mapeley Services Limited to Mapeley Holding Company Limited, a company outside the Group owned by Fortress Investment Group LLC and the former parent of MUKCO.
The shares were sold at book value.
However, the amounts have been subsequently written off as they are considered irrecoverable by the Companys Directors.
As a consequence, 599,000 has been charged to the current years income statement to write off amounts owing from Mapeley Milton Keynes Limited.
This is offset by a credit to the current years income statement for 129,000 written off owing to Willen Lake Limited.
Amounts owed by shareholders The Group has entered into an agreement to provide property management services in respect of 135 property interests owned by Pinnacle Towers Limited, a company wholly-owned by Fortress Acquisition Group.
In return for the provision of these services, the Group receives 100,000 per annum evenly spread across the year and receivable one month in arrears.
During 2005, 94,000 had been received and at 31 December 2005, 6,000 was outstanding.
The Group previously provided property management and consultancy services in respect of 36 property interests owned by BC Services UK Limited and BC Acquisition UK Limited, companies wholly-owned by Fortress Acquisition Group LLC.
This agreement was terminated during the year ended 31 December 2005.
During 2005, 13,000 had been received and with nil outstanding at 31 December 2005.
Amounts were receivable one month in arrears.
Balances owed to shareholders During the year 29.0 million of contributed surplus was repaid to shareholders and at the time of the Groups reorganisation a capital contribution of 29.0 million was called upon and received from the shareholders during the year.
The capital contribution was payable within 12 working days once demanded by MUKCO.

Related party disclosures continued As part of the Group restructuring, accrued interest charges on shareholder loans of 0.2 million were transferred to Mapeley Holding Company Limited.
Shareholder loans from FIT Mapeley Holding Limited and Fortress UK Acquisition Company Limited with a total book value of 8.1 million, of which 0.7million was received in 2005 and 0.3 million related to accrued interest, were converted into 654,998 ordinary shares on 1 June 2005.
Both these entities have significant influence over the Group at 31 December 2005 and owned a combined 70.5% of the ordinary shares in Mapeley Limited 2004: 98.9%.
Interest on the shareholder loans was paid quarterly at a rate of LIBOR plus 2% for the first year and converted to non-interest bearing for the remaining two years of the term.
Shares to Non-Executive Directors The Company issued 5,000 shares each to J W Harris, R W Carey and C N K Parkinson in their capacity as Non-executive Directors of the Company for nil consideration.
The market value of the shares at the time of issue was 23.00 per share.
The Company also awarded 5,000 shares to M Fascitelli who was appointed as a Non-executive Director on 20 December 2005.
The Company intends to issue these shares to M Fascitelli during 2006.
During the year, 805,000 has been charged to the income statement relating to share benefits expense for the Non-Executive Directors.
Subsequent events Since 31 December 2005, the Group has exchanged and completed contracts to acquire three properties for consideration of 17.0 million.
These properties are to be funded by the Groups cash resources, the investment facility and the Revolving gamma acquisition facility, a new facility arranged since 31 December 2005, details of which are set out below.
The Group is currently in negotiations to refinance the loan facility entered into by Mapeley STEPS Limited and Mapeley STEPS Contractor Limited.
If these negotiations are successfully concluded, it is currently anticipated that this will involve the repayment of the current 20 year, 178.0 million loan and replacing it with a 7 year, 200.0 million term facility.
It is also currently anticipated that the Group would enter fixed interest rate agreements at the start of the loan to fix the interest payable and that it would be required to write off unamortised loan finance costs on the borrowings.
If the transaction had occurred on 31 December 2005, the loan finance costs to be written off and the swap breakage costs would have been 4.3 million and 20.8 million, respectively.
Dividend declared The Board of the Company declared a dividend of 8.3 million 31 December 2004: nil representing 0.37 per share based on the number of shares in issue on 11 January 2006, at a board meeting held on 5 January 2006.
Secondary issue of shares On 27 January 2006, the Company issued a further 4,036,697 ordinary shares at an offer price of 27.25 per share and raised proceeds of 106.5 million net of issue costs.
The proceeds were used to repay a portion of the revolving acquisition facility which will result in a reduction in interest costs and will also allow the Group to draw funds under the revolving acquisition facility for future acquisitions.
UK Passport Service Mapeley has recently signed a contract for a term of between three and five years with the UK Passport Service UKPS, an executive agency of the Home Office.
The purpose of the contract is to acquire, fit out and deliver serviced accommodation for 69 interview offices throughout the UK.
Mapeley will acquire and fit out the approximately 17,500 sqm of office space during 2006 in a phased roll-out programme.
Thereafter, Mapeley will provide property management and facilities management services to the network of offices, which will be used by the UKPS to interview first-time passport applicants and to perform biometric testing as part of their continuing efforts to crack down on identity fraud.
Revolving acquisition facility In January 2006, the Group revised the terms and converted the revolving acquisition facility into a 10 year, 208.6 million, 4.55% fixed rate facility.
The rate of interest payable reflects the cost of the underlying swap agreements in place which were terminated at no cost to the Group on the same date.
Revolving gamma acquisition facility In January 2006, the Group also arranged the two year, 300.0 million revolving gamma acquisition facility to finance the future acquisition of investment property.
The interest rate payable on the facility is LIBOR plus 1.5 % plus mandatory costs if any.
The Group has also put in place a 10 year, 4.3725% 200.0 million swap to fix its anticipated long-term exposure to interest rate risk on these property acquisitions.
Facility management contract Mapeley has awarded a contract to Alfred McAlpine Business Services AMBS, a subsidiary of Alfred McAlpine Plc, to deliver Facilities Management FM services required under the HMRC contract.
The contract was awarded to AMBS on 3 February 2006 and it will run until Spring 2021.
Since the inception of the HMRC contract in April 2001, FM services have been provided by three sub-contractors.
AMBS will initially provide Mapeley with management services and over the first two years of the contract will expand their delivery to include a total facilities management service across the HMRC estate, including health and safety compliance.
Mapeley Limited Annual report 2005 81 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements continued 29.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation or EBITDA is defined by the Group as profit before tax, finance costs, depreciation and amortisation, valuation surplus deficit on investment property, gain on disposal of subsidiaries and impairment impairment reversal of non-investment property.
EBITDA for the year is computed as follows: 2005 2004 000 000 Loss profit before tax 56,475 43,294 Add back: Net finance cost 125,913 45,897 Depreciation and amortisation 13,420 14,712 Net valuation surplus on investment properties 18,037 48,072 Impairment of non-investment properties 589 Reversal of impairment of non-investment properties 4,645 Gains on disposal of subsidiaries 599 EBITDA 64,811 51,186 30.
Funds from operations Funds from operations or FFO is a management measure used to demonstrate the underlying operating performance of real estate businesses such as the Company.
It provides investors with information regarding the Groups ability to service debt and make capital expenditure.
FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with IFRS, therefore it should not be considered an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity, and is not necessarily indicative of cash funds available.
This calculation of FFO may be different from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
The Group defines FFO as Group EBITDA less net finance costs less the movement in the onerous lease provision less the movement in work in progress plus the movement in net asset management receipts plus the charge in respect of employee shares.
More detailed definitions of these adjustments to EBITDA are given below: Net finance costs comprise finance costs less finance income as set out in the Group income statement, adjusted to exclude amortisation of loan finance fees, gains or losses on interest rate swaps, loan termination costs and the unwinding of discounts on provisions.
The Movement in the onerous lease provision This is the net release or charge to the Group income statement as a result of the change in the Group onerous lease provisions, excluding interest charged on the unwinding of the provision.
Although these amounts offset rental costs in the income statement, they do not represent cash movements and are therefore excluded from the computation of FFO.
The Movement in work in progress This is the year on year change in Group work in progress or if negative, accrued cost.
The amount represents the increase or decrease in lifecycle costs deferred by the Group so as to match costs with revenue.
Net asset management receipts These are the total cash receipts in the year less amounts amortised in the financial period.
The accounting treatment of asset management receipts is set out in the accounting policies.
Employee shares Under IFRS 2, costs are charged to the Group income statement when share-based payments are made.
This is a non-cash expense and is therefore excluded from the measure.
2005 2004 000 000 EBITDA 64,811 51,186 Net finance costs 47,795 41,092 Movement in the onerous lease provision 2,227 5,830 Movement in work in progress 2,146 15,541 Asset management receipts 11,108 21,748 Share benefit expense 1,704 FFO 25,455 10,471 FFO per share 130 pence 69 pence 82 Mapeley Limited Annual report 2005 30.
Funds from operations continued The calculation of FFO per share is based on the following: FFO for the year of 25.5 million 2004: 10.5 million Weighted average number of ordinary shares of 19,510,770 2004: 15,100,000 The weighted average number of ordinary shares for the year ended 31 December 2004 has been restated to reflect the share for share exchange that took place on 2 June 2005, in which existing shareholders were offered 100 ordinary shares in the Company for each share held in MUKCO.
The effect of this was to reduce FFO per share from 69.33 per share to 0.69 per share.
Gearing ratio Gearing is defined as Group net debt total debt less cash and short-term deposits as a proportion of total consolidated equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
Total debt is defined as actual current and non-current loan balances together with any overdrafts owed to lenders and excludes any unamortised finance costs or adjustments to apply the effective interest rate method.
Equity is as set out in the consolidated balance sheet.
Net assets per share 2005 2004 Basic net assets per share 20.34 23.00 Diluted net assets per share 20.34 23.00 The calculation of basic and diluted net asset value per share figures is based on the following: - Consolidated net assets equity attributable to the equity holders of the Company as at 31 December 2005 of 457.0 million as at 31 December 2004: net assets of 354.2 million - Number of ordinary shares for basic net asset value per share 22,463,687 2004: 15,382,100 - Number of ordinary shares for diluted net asset value per share 22,480,166 2004: 15,382,100 The number of ordinary shares at 31 December 2004 has been restated to reflect the share for share exchange that took place on 2 June 2005, in which existing shareholders were offered 100 ordinary shares in the Company for each share held in MUKCO.

Explanation of transition to IFRS The 2004 consolidated financial statements of MUKCO, prepared under UK GAAP, have been restated under IFRS.
These special purpose consolidated IFRS Financial Statements were reported in 2005 and form the basis for the comparative information set out in these financial statements.
Following the Group reorganisation on 3 June 2005, the special purpose consolidated IFRS Financial Statements have been updated to reflect the merger method of accounting adopted by the Company to account for the Group reorganisation.
A reconciliation of the UK GAAP consolidated balance sheets at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 for the Group, together with the income statement for 2004, is shown below, together with a separate note of the effects of applying the merger method of accounting for the Group reorganisation.

Certain other leases previously classified as Property, plant and equipment do not classify as finance leases under IFRS and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation in Premiums for operating leases.
The effect of this reclassification is to reduce Property, plant and equipment by 41,034,000, increase Premium for operating leases by 22,922,000, reduce Revaluation reserve by 18,197,000 and increase Retained earnings by 85,000. b Interest rate swaps which form part of a previously unrecognised cash flow hedge are now held at fair value.
The associated losses of 56,023,000 are accumulated in the Net unrealised gains reserve and increase Current liabilities.
c Gains on Investment property valuations of 61,460,000 are reported through the income statement under IFRS.
The associated increase in the Revaluation reserve is now reported under Retained earnings.
d A new depreciation policy has been adopted in respect of Property, plant and equipment following IFRS guidance.
Land and buildings are now treated as separate components of property value and buildings have been reclassified, shortening the useful economic lives of some buildings.
Properties are carried at valuation, so the impact is to reduce Retained earnings and increase the Revaluation reserve by 2,085,000. e Individual properties valued below depreciated historical cost are written down through the income statement under IFRS.
Under UK GAAP they were written down through the Revaluation reserve on the basis that the reduction in value was expected to be temporary.
Retained earnings are reduced and Revaluation reserve increased, by 5,582,000. f Receipts from landlords relating to lease renegotiations were reported under UK GAAP over the period from conclusion of negotiations to the point at which rent was expected to be next adjusted to market rates.
Under IFRS, these receipts must be deferred and spread over the shorter of the term of the leases or the period to the first break.
A balance of 27,998,000 of Deferred asset management receipts remains at 1 January 2004, of which 1,622,000 is current.
Retained earnings were reduced by corresponding amounts.
g Following the Group reorganisation on 3 June 2005, the opening UK GAAP consolidated balance sheet at 1 January 2004 has been updated to reflect the merger method of accounting adopted by the Mapeley Limited Group to account for the Group reorganisation.
This has resulted in reclassifying issued capital of 20,000, contributed surplus of 90,417,000 and capital contribution of 29,000,000 to other reserves.

Properties are carried at valuation, so the impact is to reduce Retained earnings and increase the Revaluation reserve by 2,741,000. e Individual properties valued below depreciated historical cost are written down through the income statement under IFRS.
Retained earnings are reduced and the Revaluation reserve increased by 937,000. f An interest rate swap not classified as a hedge and also previously unrecognised, is now held at fair value.
The loss on the swap of 29,000 is reported as a current liability under IFRS and reduces Retained earnings by 29,000. g Receipts from landlords relating to lease renegotiations were reported under UK GAAP over the period from conclusion of negotiations to the point at which rent was expected to be next adjusted to market rates.
Under IFRS these receipts must be deferred and spread over the term of the lease or the period to the first break.
A balance of 50,617,000 of Deferred asset management receipts remains at 31 December 2004 of which 3,113,000 is current.
h Following the Group reorganisation on 3 June 2005, the UK GAAP Group balance sheet at 31 December 2004 has been updated to reflect the merger method of accounting adopted by the Mapeley Limited Group to account for the Group reorganisation.
This has resulted in reclassifying issued capital of 20,000, contributed surplus of 91,788,000 and capital contribution of 29,000,000 to other reserves.

Under IFRS, net gains on investment property valuations of 48,087,000 are reported through Net valuation surplus on investment property in the income statement.
b An interest rate swap, previously unrecognised, is now held at fair value.
The loss, 29,000, is reported in the income statement under Finance costs.
The swap was taken for a ten-year period against a two-year loan, because the Group planned to replace that loan with a10-year loan.
This swap is not permitted to be classified as a hedge under IFRS.
c Certain leases which were previously classified as operating are classified as finance under IFRS, reducing Property operating expenses by 335,000 and Net valuation surplus on investment property by 15,000, and increasing Finance costs by 399,000. d Under UK GAAP, the increase in the value of properties, which had previously been valued below historical cost, was credited to the Revaluation reserve.
Under IFRS, this increase in valuation of 4,645,000 was shown in the income statement in Reversal of impairment of non-investment property.
e A new depreciation policy has been adopted following IFRS guidance.
Depreciation, recorded within Property operating expenses in the income statement, has increased by 1,965,000. f Receipts from landlords relating to lease renegotiations were reported under UK GAAP over the period from conclusion of negotiations to the point at which rent was expected to be next adjusted to market rates.
Under IFRS these are required to be deferred and spread over the term of the leases.
An additional 24,944,000 was deferred in the year, and 2,325,000 of deferral from previous years was utilised with a net increase in Property operating costs of 22,619,000.
The merger method of accounting adopted by Mapeley Limited has had no effect on the consolidated income statement as originally reported in the special purpose consolidated IFRS Financial Statements.

Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Reconciliation of the UK GAAP cash flow statement for the year ended 31 December 2004 The increase in cash and short-term deposits under IFRS is the same as the increase in cash in the UK GAAP cash flow statement.
The cash flow statement is prepared using the indirect method.
The changes in the income statement described above are therefore reflected in the cash flow statement and with one exception described below reversed in the adjustments for non-cash items or working capital.
The only change to cash generated from operations relates to reclassified leases note c above where rental payments totalling 558,000 under UK GAAP become payments of interest of 399,000 still part of net cash from operations and repayments of principal of 159,000 reported within net cash from financing.
The merger method of accounting adopted by Mapeley Limited has had no effect on the consolidated cash flow statement as originally reported in the special purpose consolidated IFRS Financial Statements.
