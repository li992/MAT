Borrowings and financial instruments i Policies The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps and caps to generate the desired interest and risk profile.
Details of the interest rate collars held by the Group to manage interest rate exposures are given in note 15.
No premium payment was made for either of these collars.
However, the 104.2m collar is financed by a 0.22% adjustment to the interest rate margin paid on the borrowings.
The Groups policy is to fix or cap interest rates on at least 50% of its borrowings.
At the year-end 7% 2004: 7% of the Groups borrowings were fixed with a further 55% 2004: 52% subject to a collar.
