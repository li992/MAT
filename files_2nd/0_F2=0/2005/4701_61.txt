This plan was replaced by the Total Shareholder Return plan.
Under this plan, participants are granted a conditional right to receive shares.
All conditional rights awarded vest after a three year period the performance cycle subject to achievement of two performance tests.
The primary performance test is a comparison of Diageos three year total shareholder return the percentage growth in Diageos share price assuming all dividends and capital distributions are reinvested with the TSR of a peer group of 17 other companies.
TSR calculations for all cycles commencing on or after 1 January 2002 are converted to a common currency US dollars.
The second performance test requires that the remuneration committee not recommend the release of awards if it considers that there has not been an underlying improvement in Diageos three year financial performance, typically measured by improvement in earnings per share.
b Diageo Share Incentive Plan DSIP The first awards were in the year ended 30 June 2000 to a small number of senior executives.
The scheme involves awards of shares or ADSs over a three to five year period with performance criteria varying by employee.

Transactions on the EIT, TSR and DSIP for awards of ordinary shares and ADSs for the three years ended 30 June 2005 were as follows: Number of awards of ordinary shares Balance outstanding at 30 June 2002 3,900,705 Granted under DSIP and TSR 1,086,854 Awarded 1,355,209 Cancelled 187,238 Balance outstanding at 30 June 2003 3,445,112 Granted under DSIP and TSR 1,201,597 Awarded 958,719 Cancelled 480,748 Balance outstanding at 30 June 2004 3,207,242 Granted under DSIP and TSR 772,630 Awarded 980,224 Cancelled 248,999 Balance outstanding at 30 June 2005 2,750,649 Awards over ADSs are stated as ordinary share equivalents.
vi Employee share trusts The group funds trusts to acquire shares in the company to hedge its obligations under the EIT, TSR, DSOP, SESOP, DSIP, former GrandMet and Guinness SRSOS, USESPP and its Irish executive schemes and savings plans.

Call options are used to manage the groups obligations in respect of the supplemental executive share option scheme, USSOP, SEPSOS and Diageo SRSOS, USESPP and Irish executive schemes and savings plans.
The trusts purchase options from a third party equivalent to the outstanding options granted to executives.
Dividends receivable by the employee share trusts on the shares are waived.
