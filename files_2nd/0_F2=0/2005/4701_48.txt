18 Financial instruments and risk management Financial instruments comprise net borrowings see note 17 together with other instruments deemed to be financial instruments including certain xed asset investments, long term debtors, other long term creditors and provisions for liabilities and charges.
Disclosures dealt with in this note exclude short term debtors and creditors where permitted by the accounting standard on derivatives and other financial instruments FRS 13. i Currency risk management The group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements which will affect the groups transaction costs, and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to uctuations on the translation into sterling of its foreign currency net assets by holding net borrowings in foreign currencies and by using foreign currency swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps.
During the year ended 30 June 2005, the groups policy was to hedge currency exposure on its net assets before net borrowings at approximately the following percentages 90% for US dollars, 90% for euros and 50% for other significant currencies where a liquid foreign exchange market exists.
This policy leaves the remaining part of the groups net assets before net borrowings subject to currency movements.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign currency net borrowings and foreign exchange swaps are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses to match exchange differences on foreign equity investments, in accordance with SSAP 20.
For currencies in which there is an active market, the group seeks to hedge between 80% and 100% of forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk, for up to a maximum of 21 months forward, using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The gain or loss on the hedge is recognised at the same time as the underlying transaction.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 115 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 18 Financial instruments and risk management continued At 30 June 2005, as a result of the transaction and translation exposure cover outlined above, the group had the following outstanding gross foreign exchange contracts: Foreign currency amount Percentage of total Purchase Sell Total US dollar Euro Maturity million million million % % Year Transaction 511 1,793 2,304 50 37 2005-2007 Translation 4,723 5,280 10,003 75 17 2005-2006 At 30 June 2004, as a result of the transaction and translation exposure cover outlined above, the group had the following outstanding gross foreign exchange contracts: Foreign currency amount Percentage of total Purchase Sell Total US dollar Euro Maturity million million million % % Year Transaction 325 1,249 1,574 47 32 2004-2006 Translation 2,607 3,819 6,426 73 17 2004-2005 At 30 June 2005, there were no material monetary assets or liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of group companies, having taken into account the effect of forward contracts and other derivative financial instruments that have been utilised to match foreign currency exposure.
ii Interest rate risk management The group has an exposure to interest rate risk and is most vulnerable to changes in US dollar, sterling and euro interest rates.
To manage interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of xed to variable rate borrowings within limits approved by the board, primarily through issuing long term xed rate bonds, medium term notes and xed and oating rate commercial paper, and by utilising interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps and swaptions.
The prole of xed rate to oating rate net borrowings is maintained according to a duration measure that is equivalent to an approximate 50% xed and 50% oating amortising prole.
The number of years within the amortising prole depends on a template approved by the board.
The oating element of US dollar borrowing is partly protected using interest rate collars although, following a policy review in 2002, interest rate collars are no longer being transacted and the existing collars are reducing as individual instruments reach maturity.
Remaining interest rate collars as at 30 June 2005 will take up to approximately one year to expire.
In addition, where appropriate, the group may use forward rate agreements to manage short term interest rate exposures.
Swaps, swaptions, forward rate agreements and collars are accounted for as hedges.
Such management serves to increase the accuracy of the business planning process.
The foreign currency swaps, in the table below, adjust the currency basis of borrowings as part of the groups policy to hedge its exposure to uctuations on translation into sterling of its foreign currency net assets see i above.
The foreign currency swaps are short term in nature and therefore have a oating interest rate basis.
They are shown after taking account of euro xed interest rate swaps which convert 226 million 2004 426 million of euro oating rate financial liabilities arising from foreign currency swaps into euro xed rate financial liabilities.
At 30 June 2005, after taking account of interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements, the currency and interest rate prole of the financial liabilities and assets of the group was as follows: Fixed Interest rate free Impact of Weighted weighted weighted foreign average average average Floating Fixed Interest currency xed time to time to rate rate free Sub-total swaps Total rate maturity maturity million million million million million million % Years Years Financial liabilities: US dollar 2,797 1,111 71 3,979 663 3,316 4.9 7.4 2.9 Euro 199 563 9 771 535 1,306 4.1 2.6 2.4 Sterling 45 203 248 589 341 10.5 Other 123 37 6 166 459 625 7.5 3.7 4.9 3,164 1,711 289 5,164 258 4,906 4.7 5.7 8.2 Financial assets: US dollar 274 671 945 945 Euro 14 2236 36 Sterling 343 4 2 349 349 3.0 5.0 Other 250 11 261 261 881 4 706 1,591 1,591 3.0 5.0 Net financial liabilities assets 2,283 1,707 417 3,573 258 3,315 4.7 5.7 8.2 Diageo Annual Report 2005 116 Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 30 June 2004, after taking account of interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements, the currency and interest rate prole of the financial liabilities and assets of the group was as follows: Fixed Interest rate free Impact of Weighted weighted weighted foreign average average average Floating Fixed Interest currency xed time to time to rate rate free Sub-total swaps Total rate maturity maturity million million million million million million % Years Years Financial liabilities: US dollar 1,737 2,198 171 4,106 366 4,472 4.8 3.4 3.6 Euro 199 760 11 970 184 1,154 4.4 2.8 2.8 Sterling 737 114 851 1,217 366 3.5 Other 106 18 6 130 235 365 8.8 3.2 4.9 2,779 2,976 302 6,057 432 5,625 4.7 3.3 3.4 Guaranteed preferred securities 312 312 312 9.4 0.4 Financial assets: US dollar 587 1,739 2,326 2,326 Euro 150 50 200 200 Sterling 189 4 2 195 195 3.0 6.0 Other 293 7 300 300 1,219 4 1,798 3,021 3,021 3.0 6.0 Net financial liabilities assets 1,560 3,284 1,496 3,348 432 2,916 5.2 3.0 3.4 Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest based on short term interbank rates predominantly six monthly LIBOR and commercial paper rates.

The group had available undrawn committed bank facilities as follows: 2005 2004 million million Expiring within one year 631 1,044 Expiring in more than two years 1,157 714 1,788 1,758 Commitment fees are paid on the undrawn portion of these facilities.
Borrowings under these facilities will be at prevailing LIBOR rates plus an agreed margin, which is dependent on the period of drawdown.
These facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and, together with cash and cash equivalents, support the groups commercial paper programmes.
There are no financial covenants on the above short and long term borrowings.
Certain of these borrowings contain cross default provisions and negative pledges and related sale and lease back provisions.
The committed bank facilities are subject to a single financial covenant, being minimum interest cover ratio of two times dened as the ratio of operating profit before exceptional items, aggregated with share of associates profits, to net interest.
They are also subject to pari passu ranking and negative pledge covenants.
Any non-compliance with covenants underlying Diageos nancing arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements, and any non-compliance with covenants may, in particular circumstances, lead to an acceleration of maturity on certain notes and the inability to access committed facilities.
Diageo was in full compliance with its financial covenants throughout each of the periods presented.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 118 Notes to the consolidated financial statements iv Fair values The estimated fair values of borrowings, associated derivative financial instruments and other financial liabilities and assets at 30 June 2005 are set out below.
The fair values of quoted borrowings and guaranteed preferred securities are based on year end mid-market quoted prices.
The fair values of other borrowings, derivatives, financial instruments and other financial liabilities and assets are estimated using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end by discounting the future cash ows to the net present values.
These are based on rates obtained from third parties.
The fair value of the groups investment in General Mills, included in other financial assets at 30 June 2005 in the table below, is calculated using the quoted share price at 30 June 2005.
2005 2004 Net carrying Estimated Net carrying Estimated amount fair value amount fair value million million million million Primary financial instruments: Borrowings due within one year including overdrafts 869 876 2,001 2,077 Borrowings due after one year 3,677 3,870 3,316 3,386 Cash at bank and liquid resources 817 817 1,167 1,167 Guaranteed preferred securities 312 320 Derivatives interest rate contracts: Interest rate swaps positive values 987 18 119 negative values 16 31 15 96 Collars 3 5 11 28 Other interest rate contracts 4 4 Derivatives foreign exchange contracts: Transaction positive values 22 53 negative values 45 15 Balance sheet translation positive values 150 150 48 48 negative values 113 112 31 29 Derivatives other: General Mills options see below 53 8 63 41 Other: Other financial liabilities 392 392 295 295 Other financial assets 774 922 1,836 2,372 In October 2002, Diageo sold call options to General Mills giving General Mills the option to purchase 29 million of General Mills shares held by Diageo, subject to certain limitations.
On 4 October 2004, 4 million of the shares over which the options are exercisable, were transferred to the groups UK pension fund, together with the relevant portion of the options.
The call options have a strike price of $51.56 and expire in October 2005.
The estimated fair value of the call options over the remaining 25 million General Mills shares held by Diageo at 30 June 2005 was 8 million $13 million.
The premium of $77 million received in respect of the remaining options was deferred and is included in accruals and deferred income in other creditors.
The estimated fair value of the call options was derived using a Black Scholes model using market volatility, share price and interest rates as at 30 June 2005.
It is estimated that a 5% increase in the share price of General Mills would increase the negative fair value by 9 million.
The difference between net carrying amount and estimated fair value reects unrealised gains or losses inherent in the instruments based on valuations at 30 June 2005.
The volatile nature of the markets means that values at any subsequent date could be signicantly different from the values reported above.
