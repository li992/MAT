A credit of 0.6m for the group 2004 charge of 0.3m and a credit of 0.2m for the company 2004 credit of 0.1m has been made to the income statement in the year representing the movement in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps.
Currency swaps The company has put in place cross currency swaps to swap the principal and fixed rate interest under the US$ loan notes issued in 2001 into fixed rate interest sterling liabilities with a weighted average interest rate of 7.66% a range of 7.6% to 7.7% and maturity dates matching the underlying loan notes note 20 d. The group has put in place cross currency swaps to swap the principal and fixed rate interest under the US$ loan notes issued in 2003 into fixed rate interest sterling liabilities with a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% a range of 6.6% to 6.8% and maturity dates matching the underlying loan notes note 20 d. The cross currency swaps in respect of the 2001 and 2003 US$ loan notes are designated and are effective under IAS 39 as cash flow hedges, and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity within the hedging reserve.
The group has put in place cross currency swaps to swap the principal and fixed rate interest under the US$ loan notes issued in 2004 into floating rate interest sterling liabilities at a range between LIBOR 1.58% and LIBOR 1.63% with maturity dates matching the underlying loan notes note 20 d. These swaps are designated and are effective under IAS 39 as fair value hedges.
The movement in the fair value of the swaps has therefore been taken to the group income statement together with the movement in the fair value of the underlying hedged loan notes.
The net difference between the movements in the fair value of the swap and the loan notes resulted in a credit to the group income statement of 0.2m 2004 charge of 0.3m.
