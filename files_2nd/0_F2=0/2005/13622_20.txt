Notes to the Company Financial Statements Rotork 77 for the year ended 31 December 2005 Annual Report 2005 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2005 29.
Accounting policies The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements of the Company with the exception of FRS 25 paragraphs 15 to 50 which were applied from 1 January 2005 as explained below.
Notes 30 to 40 relate to the Company rather than the Group.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements, except as noted below.
In these financial statements the following new standards have been adopted for the first time, FRS 20 Share-based payments, FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date, FRS 22 Earnings per share, FRS 23 Changes in forex rates, the presentation requirements of FRS 25 Financial instruments: presentation and disclosure and FRS 28 Corresponding amounts.
The accounting policies under these new standards are set out below together with an indication of the effects of their adoption.
FRS 28 Corresponding amounts has had no material effect as it imposes the same requirements for comparatives as the Companies Act 1985.
The corresponding amounts in these financial statements are restated in accordance with the new policies and the impact of this change is shown in note 39.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Under FRS 1 the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that the Group includes the Company in its own published consolidated financial statements.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 and has not disclosed transactions with entities which are subsidiaries of the Group.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Depreciation and amortisation Freehold land is not depreciated.
Long leasehold buildings are amortised over fifty years or the expected useful life of the building where less than fifty years.
Other assets are depreciated by equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated useful lives and residual values at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 4% Short leasehold buildings period of lease Machinery, plant and equipment 10% to 33% Post retirement benefits The Company participates in a Group wide pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17 Retirement benefits, accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Reclassification of preference shares Following the adoption of FRS 25, Financial instruments, the cumulative redeemable preference shares issued by the Company have been reclassified as long term debt.
The preference dividends have been presented within interest payable.
The Company has taken advantage of the transitional arrangements of FRS 25 not to restate corresponding amounts in accordance with the above policy.
The adjustments necessary to implement this policy have been made as at 1 January 2005 with the adjustment to net assets taken though the current year reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds.
Corresponding amounts for 2004 are presented and disclosed in accordance with the requirements of FRS 4 as applicable in 2004.

Accounting policies continued Share based payments The Company has adopted FRS 20 in the year and the accounting policies followed are in all material regards the same as the Groups policy under IFRS 2.
This policy is shown in note 1 to these accounts.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in full, without discounting, on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law, except for the items explained below.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the assets or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where there is no commitment to remit those earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
