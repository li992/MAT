The Mitchells & Butlers group was created on its separation from Six Continents on 15 April 2003. significant changes were made to the nancing structure of the Group which resulted in the replacement of inter company balances owed to Six Continents with external debt.
In addition, the Mitchells & Butlers group no longer benefited from the Six Continents group tax arrangements that were in place prior to the separation.
The pro forma group profit and loss accounts for 2003 and 2002 therefore present the results on the basis that the post separation financing and taxation structure had been in place since 1 October 2002.
The pro forma profit and loss accounts are also stated before exceptional items.
