The following table shows the estimated amount of loans that would be reported using the SECs classifications.
The figures are stated before deducting the value of security held or related provisions.
IAS 39 requires interest to be recognised on a financial asset or a group of financial assets after impairment at the rate of interest used to discount recoveries when measuring the impairment loss.
Thus, interest on impaired financial assets is credited to profit or loss as the discount on expected recoveries unwinds.
Despite this, such assets are not considered performing.
All loans that have an impairment provision are classified as non-accrual.
This is a change from past practice where certain loans with provisions were classified as past 238 due 90 days or potential problem loans and interest accrued on them.

'Foreign' comprises the Groups transactions conducted through offices outside the UK and through those offices in the UK specifically organised to service international banking transactions.
2 All loans against which an impairment provision is held are reported in the non-accrual category.
3 Loans where an impairment event has taken place but no impairment recognised.
This category is used for over-collateralised non-revolving credit facilities.
4 Loans for which an impairment event has occurred but no impairment provision is necessary.
This category is used for over-collateralised advances and revolving credit facilities where identification as 90 days overdue is not feasible.
