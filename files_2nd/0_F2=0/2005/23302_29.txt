Notes to the Accounts Investment trust companies are exempt from tax on capital gains if they meet the Inland Revenue criteria set out in s842 ICTA 1988 for a given period.
Therefore, any capital return is not included in the above reconciliation.
c At 31 March 2005, the Company had net surplus management expenses and net surplus losses on loan relationships being the excess of interest payable on the debenture stocks and any other borrowing over interest receivable totalling 170,133,447 2004: 151,680,380 and eligible unrelieved foreign taxation totalling 49,792 2004: nil.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these.
This is because the Company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of the deductible expenses of that future period and, accordingly, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing surplus expenses.
