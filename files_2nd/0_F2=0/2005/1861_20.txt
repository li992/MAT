ADOPTION OF IFRS This is the first year that the Group has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The following disclosures are required in the year of transition.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 December 2004 and the date of transition to IFRS was therefore 1 January 2004.
AS AT AS AT 1 JANUARY 31 DECEMBER 2004 2004 Notes m m Reconciliation of shareholders' equity Shareholders' equity under UK GAAP 680.6 659.1 Adjustments Share based payments 1 0.9 3.5 Goodwill and acquired intangible assets 2 20.0 Dividends 3 34.3 35.9 Deferred taxation 4 14.9 11.2 Pensions 5 37.7 51.4 691.2 671.3 2004 Notes m Reconciliation of profit for the period Profit for the period under UK GAAP 49.8 Adjustments Share based payments 1 3.0 Goodwill and acquired intangible assets 2 20.7 Deferred taxation 4 2.5 Pensions 5 2.9 67.9 Notes to the reconciliation of shareholders equity and profit for 2004 1.
IFRS 2 Share Based Payments requires the recognition of a charge in the income statement for share-based payments based on the fair value of the award as at the date of grant.
The Group has recognised a charge in the income statement for the fair value of outstanding share options granted to employees after 7 November 2002.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations requires that goodwill arising on acquisitions is not amortised, but is instead subject to annual impairment testing in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
The Group has applied the exemption allowing it not to restate business combinations prior to 1 January 2004.
IAS 10 Events After the Balance Sheet Date requires that dividends declared after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date as the liability does not represent a present obligation as defined by IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
As a result liabilities have been reduced by the amount of the proposed dividends at the balance sheet date.
IAS 12 Income Taxes requires recognition of a deferred tax asset relating to the temporary difference between the tax basis and carrying value nil of goodwill written off to reserves prior to the introduction of FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
The Group has also recognised a deferred tax liability for temporary differences relating to certain fixed assets without tax bases which were acquired as part of previous business combinations and were non-qualifying items under UK tax law.
The Group has adopted the option within the amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits to recognise the net pension obligation of all Group plans at the transition date, with the obligation set against opening reserves.
All actuarial gains and losses after the transition date are recognised in full through the statement of recognised income and expenses.
Further details of the transition to IFRS can be found in the IFRS Restatement document reported to the London Stock Exchange on 28 July 2005, which is also available on the Groups website www.

Other intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives which is on average 10 years.
The 6.1 million arising on acquisitions in prior years is as a result of the finalisation of fair value exercises.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS continued Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2005 2004 m m Airport Services: ASIG US 85.8 73.6 Signature US 99.2 84.1 Signature UK 16.5 15.1 Other several CGUs 19.7 12.0 Engine Repair and Overhaul: Dallas Airmotive 46.4 41.5 H&S Aviation 10.7 10.7 Oxford Aviation Services 14.3 14.3 Other several CGUs 23.9 11.5 Materials Technology: Veratec 55.0 50.8 Tecnofibra 14.5 15.0 Tenotex 22.7 22.8 Other several CGUs 21.1 18.9 429.8 370.4 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows for the following years based on an estimated growth rate of 2.5 per cent.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 11.15 per cent.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 75.
Where assets have been impaired the recoverable amount has been determined by reference to its value in use, estimated using a discount rate of 11.15 per cent.

This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction of the cash flows.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

The disclosures required by FRS 13 Derivatives and other Financial Instruments: Disclosures in respect of the year ended 31 December 2004 are detailed in the Appendix below.
Currency Risks The overall policy of the Group is to use currency derivatives to manage the foreign currency risk arising within the underlying businesses.
It is the Group's policy not to undertake any speculative currency transactions using derivatives.
The Group manages its transactional currency risk by hedging significant currency exposures in accordance with foreign exchange policies that our subsidiaries have in place which have been pre-agreed between Group Treasury and the subsidiary.
Each subsidiary with significant foreign exchange exposures has its own pre-agreed foreign exchange policy with each policy individually tailored to the foreign exchange exposure within the relevant subsidiary.
Transaction currency risk is managed through the use of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge currency flows through the BBA Group plc company bank accounts and to ensure that the Group is not exposed to foreign exchange risk through the management of its international cash pooling structure.
As at 31 December 2005, the Group had committed to a notional amount of 448.8 million 2004: 347.1 million of forward foreign exchange contracts to buy or sell foreign currency.
The fair value of currency derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges amounting to 0.4 million has been deferred in equity during the year.
An amount of 2.5 million has been transferred to the income statement in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts that matured during the period.
Changes in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts which have not been designated as cash flow hedges amounting to 1.7 million have been transferred to the income statement in the year.
The Group manages its translational currency risk by hedging between 50 and 85 per cent of overseas net assets through the use of foreign currency denominated loans, forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps.
As at 31 December 2005, the Group had committed to a notional amount of 503.5 million 2004: 332.9 million of cross currency swaps and a notional amount of 44.4 million 2004: nil of additional forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge overseas net assets.
The fair value of currency derivatives that are designated and effective as net investment hedges amounting to 31.1 million has been deferred in equity.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Interest Rate Risks The Group's policy with regards to interest rate risk is to use a combination of debt and derivative instruments to fix portions of the exposures for varying periods based upon the debt maturity profile and the expectation of future interest rates.
The majority of the Group's debt and cash balances are based on floating interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to movements on these floating interest rates.
As at 31 December 2005, the Group had committed to a notional amount of 337.2 million 2004: 409.4 million of interest rate swaps which are used to hedge the Group's interest rate exposure.
The fair value of interest rate swaps designated and effective as cash flow hedges of 2.9 million has been deferred in equity.
An amount of 3.7 million has been offset against hedged interest payments made in the period.
Commodity Risks The Group's non-woven business, BBA Fiberweb, has commodity raw material price exposure to a number of raw materials with the majority of the exposure relating to polypropylene.
The Group's policy is to manage its polypropylene exposure through a combination of physical factors in managing the business as well as using derivative instruments including fixed price swaps and futures contracts in accordance with a pre-agreed policy.
As at 31 December 2005, the Group had committed to a notional amount of 16.6 million of polypropylene futures contracts which are used to hedge BBA Fiberweb's polypropylene raw material price exposure.
The fair value of commodity swaps designated and effective as cash flow hedges of 3.4 million has been deferred in equity.
Appendix: FRS 13 Derivatives and other Financial Instruments: Disclosures as at 31 December 2004: Interest rate profile After taking into account interest rate swaps and currency swaps entered into by the Group, the interest rate profile of the Group's financial liabilities at 31 December 2004 was as follows: FLOATING FIXED RATE RATE TOTAL m m m Sterling 128.2 128.2 US Dollar 306.4 335.9 642.3 Euro 73.6 151.5 225.1 Other 44.9 44.9 Financial liabilities excluding non-equity capital 380.0 660.5 1,040.5 Non-equity capital: Cumulative preference shares 0.2 0.2 Cumulative redeemable convertible preference shares 56.0 56.0 Total financial liabilities 436.2 660.5 1,096.7 Of which: Total borrowings 707.6 Notional value of derivative financial instruments 332.9 Non-equity capital 56.2 Total financial liabilities 1,096.7 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 81.

FLOATING FIXED RATE RATE TOTAL m m m The Group held the following financial assets: Sterling 73.4 369.3 442.7 US Dollar 56.3 56.3 Euro 20.7 20.7 Other 9.2 9.2 Vendor notes and other debtors due outside one year 18.8 18.8 Total financial assets 73.4 474.3 547.7 Of which: Cash at bank and short-term deposits 134.0 Notional value of derivative financial instruments 394.9 Vendor notes and other debtors due outside one year 18.8 Total financial assets 547.7 The fixed rate on the sterling assets is in relation to interest rate swaps with a weighted average interest rate of 4.1 per cent which were due to mature during the second half of 2005.
Cash at bank and short-term deposits earn interest determined with reference to the relevant money market deposit rates.
Vendor notes relate to disposals made in previous years and earn interest determined with reference to the relevant LIBOR.
Currency exposures The extent to which the Groups operating entities hold monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than in their local currency has been reviewed.
Taking into account the impact of forward currency contracts and other derivative instruments, the Group had no material profit and loss exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as at 31 December 2004.
Gains and losses on hedges The Group enters into forward currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposures that arise on sales denominated in foreign currencies immediately those sales are transacted.
It also uses interest rate swaps and currency swaps to manage its interest rate profile and translation exposures.
Gains and losses on hedges are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued The table below sets out unrecognised gains and losses in respect of hedges at the beginning and end of the year: m Net losses on hedges at 1 January 2004 13.2 Net losses arising in previous years included in 2004 results 8.1 Net losses arising in previous years and not included in 2004 results 5.1 Net gains arising in 2004 and not included in 2004 results 6.9 Net gains on hedges at 31 December 2004 1.8 Of which: Net losses expected to be recognised in 2005 or after 0.6 Net gains expected to be recognised in 2006 or after 2.4 1.8 Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: 2004 m In one year or less 50.6 In more than one year but not more than two years 9.5 In more than two years but not more than five years 621.9 In more than five years 25.6 707.6 Borrowing facilities The Group had undrawn committed facilities at 31 December, in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met, as follows: 2004 m Expiring in one year or less 2.1 Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years Expiring in more than two years 347.3 349.4 Fair values Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the Group's financial assets and liabilities at 31 December: 2004 BOOK VALUE FAIR VALUE m m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations: Short-term financial liabilities and current proportion of long-term borrowings 50.6 50.6 Long-term borrowings 657.0 657.5 Non-equity capital 56.2 91.1 Cash deposits 134.0 134.0 Vendor notes and other debtors due outside one year 18.8 18.8 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate and currency profile: Interest rate swaps 6.4 Currency swaps 62.0 62.0 Forward foreign currency contracts 8.2 Commodity swap The fair value of the non-equity capital, interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts have been determined by reference to prices available from the markets on which the instruments involved are traded.
All the other fair values shown above have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The interest rates on currency swaps are based upon short-term floating rates and therefore the difference between the book value and fair value is immaterial.

The liabilities have a expected life of up to 5 years.
PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Group operates a number of plans worldwide.
The main plans, which cover the majority of employees, are of the funded defined benefit type.
The normal pension cost for the Group, including early retirement costs, was 11.6 million 2004: 12.2 million of which 6.5 million 2004: 8.8 million was in respect of foreign schemes.
This includes 6.0 million 2003: 5.8 million relating to defined contribution schemes.
The pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries, where practicable, using a variety of methods and assumptions and otherwise, in respect of certain foreign schemes, in accordance with local regulations.
The Groups main UK pension commitments are contained within a final salary defined benefit scheme with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
Contributions to the scheme are made and the pension cost is assessed using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme was as at 31 March 2004.
The Group's foreign pension schemes mainly relate to a number of funded final salary defined benefit pension arrangements in North America.
Pension costs have been calculated by independent qualified actuaries, using the projected unit method and assumptions appropriate to the arrangements in place.
The overseas deficit includes unfunded schemes valued at 27.3 million.
The Group also operates a number of plans in North America which principally cover healthcare and life assurance benefits for its retirees.
The costs of these other post-retirement benefits are assessed by independent qualified actuaries.
In accordance with IAS 19, and subject to materiality, the latest actuarial valuations of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes and healthcare plans have been reviewed and updated as at 31 December 2005.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2005 2004 m m Deferred tax liabilities 59.5 66.2 Deferred tax assets -- 59.5 66.2 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to tax losses and other temporary differences of 35.5 million 2004: 35.4 million available for offset against future profits.
These assets have not been recognised as the precise incidence of future profits in the relevant countries and legal entities can not be accurately predicted at this time.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 16.2 million 2004: 12.2 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted and calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
The inputs into the model were as follows: 2005 2004 ISSUED IN ISSUED IN MARCH 2003 OTHERS MARCH 2003 OTHERS Weighted average share price pence 153 290 153 273 Weighted average exercise price pence 153 224 153 268 Expected volatility % 14.5% 12.8% 21.5% 16.9% Expected life months 6 33 25 33 Risk-free rate % 4.0% 4.2% 3.9% 4.1% Expected dividends % 3.8% 3.8% 5.5% 4.2% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the the period of time equivalent to the remaining contractual life of the option.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of 0.6 million 2004: 0.4 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.
Cash-settled share-based payments The Group issues to certain employees share appreciation rights SARs that require the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the SAR to the employee at the date of exercise.
The fair value of the SARs is determined using the Black-Scholes model using the assumptions noted in the above table.
The Group has recorded liabilities of 7.6 million 2004: 3.5 million and total expenses of 4.1 million 2004: 2.6 million.
The total intrinsic value of vested SARs at 31 December 2005 was 0.2 million 2004: 1.3 million.
Other share-based payment plan The Companys savings related share option scheme is open to all eligible UK employees.
Options are granted at a price equal to the average three day middle market price of a BBA Group ordinary share prior to the date of grant, less 20%.
Options are granted under three or five year SAYE contracts.
The maximum overall employee contribution is 250 per month.
Pursuant to this plan, the Group issued 24,772 ordinary shares in 2005.

ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS The Group made a number of acquisitions during the year which are detailed in the Directors' Report on page 40.
The directors have performed an exercise to establish the provisional fair value of the assets and liabilities of these acquisitions.
The net assets acquired and the goodwill arising on these acquisitions are as set out below: ADJUSTMENTS PROVISIONAL TO ALIGN FAIR BOOK ACCOUNTING VALUE TO VALUE REVALUATIONS POLICIES BBA GROUP m m m m Intangible assets 0.3 0.3 Property, plant and equipment 3.4 0.7 4.1 Investments Inventories 0.2 0.2 Receivables 4.1 4.1 Payables 2.4 2.4 Taxation 0.5 0.5 Net borrowings Net assets 6.1 0.7 6.8 Goodwill 23.4 Cash consideration 30.2 Deferred consideration 2.2 Net cash consideration paid in 2005 28.0 The fair values set out above are provisional and may be subject to amendment on finalisation of the fair value exercises.
The acquisitions noted above contributed 1.4 million to the Groups net operating cash flows, paid nil in respect of net returns on investment and servicing of finance, paid nil in respect of taxation, paid nil in respect of capital expenditure and utilised nil for investing activities.
If the acquisitions had been completed on 1 January 2005, total revenue for the period from acquisitions would have been 24.8 million, and profit for the year would have been 4.7 million.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The Group is party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business, including specific product liability and environmental claims in BBA Non-wovens North America and BBA Aviation respectively.
Any liabilities are likely to be mitigated by legal defences, insurance, reserves and third party indemnities.
Additionally, the Group has previously owned businesses that manufactured products containing asbestos.
No BBA company has manufactured or sold any products or materials containing asbestos for many years.
A small number of former BBA companies have been named as defendants to asbestos related claims.
When these companies were sold, BBA retained certain obligations to indemnify the purchasers against such claims.
Notwithstanding such indemnity arrangements, the costs incurred by BBA in dealing with claims made against these former BBA companies have been immaterial to BBA.
During the period 1989 to 31 December 2005, BBA's costs of defending and disposing of all asbestos related claims, net of insurance coverage, were approximately 3.5 million.
BBA maintains a portfolio of insurance coverage in respect of the majority of such claims, including legal defence costs and liability cover.
State operated compensation programmes have also provided coverage.
On the basis of its past claims experience, BBA does not anticipate any material increase in the cost to it of resolving such claims.
The directors do not currently anticipate that the outcome of the proceedings and claims set out above either individually, or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE The Group has made a number of acquisitions since the balance sheet date which are detailed in the Directors' Report on page 40.
Exercises to establish the fair value of the assets and liabilities of these acquisitions have not yet been performed.
The provisional net assets acquired and the goodwill arising on these acquisitions are as set out below: ADJUSTMENTS PROVISIONAL TO ALIGN FAIR BOOK ACCOUNTING VALUE TO VALUE REVALUATIONS POLICIES BBA GROUP m m m m Intangible assets 4.0 4.0 Property, plant and equipment 3.4 3.4 Investments Inventories 8.3 0.1 8.2 Receivables 4.2 0.1 4.1 Payables 4.3 0.5 4.8 Taxation Net borrowings 0.1 0.1 Net assets liabilities 15.7 0.7 15.0 Goodwill 31.2 Cash consideration 46.2 30.
