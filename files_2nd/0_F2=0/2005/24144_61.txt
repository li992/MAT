Share based payments continued The fair value of services rendered in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured using binomial modelling techniques.
All share options are granted under a service condition.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the grant-date fair value measurement of the services received.
The ESOS schemes contain a performance condition based on total shareholder return ranked against other FTSE 100 companies.
This is a market performance condition and is taken into account by scenario-based modelling in the grant-date fair value measurement of the services received.

Share based payments continued c F&C Asset Management plc 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme F&C provides a share option plan via the 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme, introduced in March 2003.
The exercise price is equal to the average quoted market price of F&Cs shares on the date of grant.
The vesting period is three years.
Options are settled by an allotment of shares to individuals.
No cash alternative is available.
The vesting of options granted under the 2002 Executive Scheme will be dependant on the achievement by F&C of specified thresholds of earnings per share, before amortisation and impairment of intangibles, restructuring costs and the cost of the Re-Investment Plan F&C Underlying EPS, growth in excess of the growth in the retail price index RPI over a three year performance period commencing on the first day of the accounting period in which the grant was made.

2002 Share Save Scheme The 2002 Share Save Scheme is an all employee share scheme which was introduced in March 2003.
The options granted entitle the holders to acquire F&C shares, whether by subscription or purchase, at a price per F&C share determined by the directors prior to the issue of invitations.
The price at which options can be offered cannot be less than 80% of the middle-market quotation of an F&C share at the date of grant.

Share based payments continued The Re-Investment Plan The Re-Investment Plan was a plan established to allow employees previously employed by F&C Group Holdings Limited F&CGH Group prior to the merger to voluntarily re-invest one half of their entitlement under the Shadow Equity Plan SEP into ordinary shares in F&C and rights to receive further ordinary shares in F&C.
The purpose of the Re-Investment Plan, which was a one-off plan linked to the merger, was to encourage key former F&CGH Group employees to re-invest one half of their proceeds of their vested SEP entitlement into Investment Shares which will be forfeitable for a period up to 2 years should the participant voluntarily resign or be dismissed for gross misconduct within 24 months of completion of the merger on 11 October 2004.
To encourage reinvestment, and in recognition of the fact that the Investment Shares carry forfeiture provisions, after three years participants will receive up to one Matching Share for each Investment Share subject to continued employment and achievement of performance conditions relating to EPS growth.
One third of Matching Shares have no performance criteria, while the remaining two-thirds vest in line with performance based on F&C Underlying EPS growth between 2003 and 2006.
The cash settled element of the awards is based on dividends payable on the F&C shares during the vesting period, prior to becoming unconditional being notionally reinvested in F&C shares.
Once the award shares vest, the value of the notional shares is paid to the employee in cash.
The number of Investment Share and Matching Share awards are as follows: 2005 2004 Investment shares Matching shares Investment shares Matching shares No.
The weighted average F&C share price during 2005 was 212 pence 2004: 220 pence.

Share based payments continued The Long-Term Remuneration Plan LTRP The LTRP is the primary long term incentive arrangement of F&C.
Vesting of the F&C shares that are the subject of an award under the LTRP will be dependent upon specified performance conditions and conditions of continued service.
The performance conditions applied to the LTRP are determined by the F&C Board and are measured over a three-year performance period.
50% of any awards relate to the achievement of total shareholder return TSR targets and 50% of the award relates to real F&C Underlying EPS growth.

795 employees were granted 100 free shares, without conditions.
Awards are therefore settled in equity and do not have a vesting period.
Awards were granted on 21 June 2005 at a share price of 1.95.
The expense associated with this award was 156,000.
The Purchased Equity Plan The Purchased Equity Plan operates in conjunction with the discretionary bonus scheme and is intended to encourage shareholding by management and employees of F&C by providing for: The compulsory purchase of shares using annual bonus above a threshold level: and Voluntary purchase of shares using annual bonus, with associated matching shares.
Vesting of any matching award is dependent on the satisfaction of performance conditions and continued service.
The performance conditions relate to real F&C Underlying EPS growth measured over a three year period.
A cash settled element of the awards is based on dividends payable on the F&C shares during the vesting period prior to becoming unconditional being notionally reinvested in F&C shares.
