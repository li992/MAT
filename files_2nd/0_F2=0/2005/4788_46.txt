Financial Instruments Continued 30 b Interest Rate and Currency Profiles The main functional currency of the Group is the US dollar, being the currency in which the majority of purchases are denominated and to which most of the selling prices are linked.
Other major currencies are the South African rand, Sterling, Australian dollar, Singapore dollar and the Euro.
Monetary assets and liabilities are generally economically hedged and therefore there are limited transactional exposures that would give rise to net currency gains or losses in the profit and loss account.
The interest rate and currency profiles of the Groups financial liabilities are as follows: Financial Liabilities 2005 2005 2005 2005 2004 2004 2004 2004 Fixed Floating Non-interest Fixed Floating Non-interest rate rate bearing rate rate bearing financial financial financial financial financial financial liabilities liabilities liabilities Total liabilities liabilities liabilities Total Currency $000 $000 $000 $000 $000 $000 $000 $000 US dollars 101,385 42 4,313 105,740 100,906 7 111 101,024 South African rand 142,805 34,128 - 176,933 - 28,343 - 28,343 Euro - 36 1,384 1,420 - 120 - 120 Australian dollars - - 3,809 3,809 - - - - Gross financial liabilities 244,190 34,206 9,506 287,902 100,906 28,470 111 129,487 The fixed rate financial liability relates to the convertible bonds, which bear interest at 5.375%, and the capitalised finance lease, as detailed in Notes 21 and 22.
Floating rate balances relate to bank loans, overdrafts and loans.
Interest is based on the relevant interbank rate.
The non-interest bearing financial liabilities relate to deferred consideration.
Interest on floating rate bank deposits is based on the relevant interbank rate.
The equity investments are unquoted equities, as detailed in Note 16.
30 c Fair Values of Financial Assets and Liabilities Gross Financial Liabilities The estimated fair value of the gross financial liabilities amounting to US$287.9 million 2004: US$129.5 million equates to the carrying amount.
The fair value of the capitalised finance lease is deemed to be the same as the carrying value, as the lease has been capitalised at a fixed interest rate, which was market related at the time of entering into the lease, based on the credit risk rate of the Group.
The fair value of the convertible bonds is deemed to be the same as the carrying value as it is not practical to estimate the fair value with sufficient reliability due to the uncertainty of the future cash flows of the various options contained in the terms of the convertible bonds Note 22.
Gross Financial Assets The estimated fair value of the gross financial assets amounting to US$452.5 million 2004: US$464.1 million approximates the carrying amount.

These contracts were entered into to cover foreign commitments not yet due.
Market values have been used to determine the fair values of these forward foreign exchange contracts.
30 d Hedging The Groups policy is to hedge all material transactional currency exposure.
An analysis of the unrecognised hedging gains and losses is as follows: Total net gains losses Gains Losses $000 $000 $000 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 October 2004 414 1,126 712 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised this year 414 1,126 712 Gains and losses arising before 1 October 2004 that were not recognised in the year --- Gains and losses arising in the year to 30 September 2005 that were not recognised in that year 2,121 1,053 1,068 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 30 September 2005 expected to be recognised in the year to 30 September 2006 2,121 1,053 1,068 091
