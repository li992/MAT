The Groups pension cost for the year amounted to $19 million 2004: $15 million and where appropriate is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified independent actuaries.
The latest actuarial valuation of the largest scheme, the Man Group plc Pension Fund formerly known as the ED & F Man Limited Group Pension Fund, a UK defined benefit pension plan, was made at 31 December 2002 using the market-related approach.
The most significant actuarial assumptions were price inflation 2.5% per annum, wage and salary increases 5.0% per annum and investment return 6.4% per annum.
Actuarial valuations are conducted every three years.
The results of this actuarial valuation of the Man Group plc Pension Fund give the market value of the assets of the scheme as $172 million.
The actuarial value of the assets of the scheme represented approximately 87% of the liabilities for the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The funding level on a Minimum Funding Requirement basis was 108%.
The Group has net pension prepayments amounting to $14 million 2004: $10 million, which are included in debtors, this being the excess of the actual contributions paid over the accumulated pension cost.
Other than pensions, the Group does not operate any other form of post-retirement benefit schemes.

Staff costs and employees continued ii FRS 17 disclosures The Group has implemented the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The valuations used for FRS 17 disclosures have been based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the UK scheme at 31 December 2002.
The UK scheme is a closed scheme and the current service cost is expected to increase as the members approach retirement.
For the UK scheme, the Group has agreed to contribute 23.1% of pensionable salaries each year until 2008 and in addition, to make a $2 million payment twice a year until 2013.
The valuations of both the UK and US schemes were updated by a qualified independent actuary at 31 March 2005 to take account of the requirements of FRS 17.
In addition a new Swiss scheme, which has some of the characteristics of a defined benefit scheme, was introduced in July 2003.
