Investments are all classified as Held at fair value, through profit or loss under IFRS and are carried at bid prices which equate to their fair value of 434,128,000.
They were previously carried at mid prices.
The difference of 962,000 is included in capital reserves.
Dividends amounting to 10,644,000 relating to the year ended 31 December 2004 are not recognised in the period to which they relate, as was the case under UK GAAP, but rather when the shareholders right to receive them has been established.
As a result the final dividend for 2004 has not been recognised under IFRS and is included in retained earnings.
