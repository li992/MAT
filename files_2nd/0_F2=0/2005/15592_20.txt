The calculation for earnings, including and excluding net profit loss on disposal of fixed assets, integration costs and goodwill amortisation, is based on the profit for the financial year of 1,366m 2004 1,100m.
For the purposes of calculating earnings per share, the number of shares is the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 7,707 million 2004 7,307 million.
The calculation for diluted earnings per share uses the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted by the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The dilution effect is calculated on the full exercise of all ordinary share options granted by the Group, including performance-based options which the Group considers to have been earned.
The calculation compares the difference between the exercise price of exercisable ordinary share options, weighted for the period over which they were outstanding, with the average daily mid-market closing price over the period.
The alternative measure of earnings per share is provided because it reflects the Groups underlying trading performance excluding the effect of the profit loss on disposal of fixed assets, integration costs and amortisation of goodwill.
