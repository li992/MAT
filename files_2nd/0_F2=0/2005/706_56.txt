UK scheme The Group operates a principal UK pension scheme which has two plans: the UK Benefit Plan which is a funded defined benefit arrangement, and the UK Contribution Plan, which is a funded defined contribution arrangement.
Both plans are administered by an independent company and their assets are held under trust separately from those of the Group.
The pension costs in respect of the UK benefit plan are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent firm of actuaries.
The most recent actuarial valuation used for this purpose was carried out as at 1 January 2003.
This has been updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19, in order to assess the liabilities at 31 December 2005.
Following the valuation, it was agreed to adopt an employer contribution rate of 10.9% of pensionable pay, effective from 1 January 2004.
In addition annual payments of 5.5 million were agreed for 2003, 2004 and 2005 and further annual payments of 4.3 million for the subsequent 11 years.
Previously, the rate payable had been 13.3% of pensionable pay since 1 January 2001.
