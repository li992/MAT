For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
For cash-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the liability is settled.
Generally, the compensation expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or nonmarket performance conditions.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20 IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, the Company has not applied this policy to equity-settled awards that were granted on or before 7 November 2002.

PENSIONS The Company operates a number of funded defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom that provide benefits based upon final pensionable salary and the period of service of the individual employees.
The plan assets are held separately from the Companys assets in funds that are under the control of trustees.
Day to day management of the plan assets is carried out by independent investment managers who, at the request of the Company, are prohibited by the trustees from investing directly in the Company.
Certain employees and former employees whose pension benefits exceed the maximum that may be provided from the Companys defined benefit pension plans are entitled to an additional unfunded pension payable directly by the Company after their retirement.
The defined benefit pension plans operated by the Company are closed to new entrants.
Full actuarial valuations of the plans are carried out at least every three years.
The last full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2004.

BACKGROUND The Company operates a number of share-based compensation arrangements to provide incentives to the Companys senior management and other eligible employees.
Details of the schemes in respect of which options and awards are outstanding are set out in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 50 to 55.
The information provided below relates only to such options and awards that were granted to persons who are employees of the Company.
SHARE OPTIONS Following a review by the Board in 2004, it was decided that the Companys executive share option schemes would not be renewed when they lapsed for the purposes of new grants in May 2005.
Accordingly, no new options were granted under these schemes during 2005.
Options will continue to be granted from time to time under the Companys savings-related share option scheme, which is restricted to employees who are resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom.
Options granted under the Companys share option schemes are classified as equity-settled awards.
The compensation expense recognised during the period in respect of share options was 1.4 million 2004 0.7 million.

The compensation expense recognised in respect of share options is based on their fair value at the grant date calculated using the Black-Scholes optionpricing model.
Assumptions made in calculating the fair values of options granted to the Companys employees during the period were as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 1 January 2005 2005 Options granted 32,983 1,907,994 Weighted average fair value 87.24 p 64.77 p Weighted average assumptions: Share price 273.00 p 250.33 p Exercise price 218.40 p 239.05 p Expected volatility 30.46% 31.50% Expected life 5.25 years 5.83 years Risk free interest rate 3.84% 4.51% Expected dividends 12.60 p 12.00 p Expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the market price of the Companys ordinary shares over the period since May 2001 when, following a period of significant fide-merger activity, the Group was re-focused on its remaining core businesses.
Adjustments have been made to the expected life used in the model to reflect the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The weighted average contractual life of share options outstanding to the Companys employees at the end of the period was as follows: As at 31 December 2005 As at 1 January 2005 Weighted Weighted average average remaining remaining Outstanding contractual life Outstanding contractual life Number Years Number Years Range of exercise prices: 150p to 200p 4,569,914 6.00 4,646,580 6.99 201p to 250p 4,730,778 7.26 4,863,026 8.01 251p to 300p 3,147,722 7.06 3,147,722 8.06 301p and higher 1,015,228 6.12 1,142,728 6.33 13,463,642 13,800,056 C.

During the period, awards were made over 349,598 ordinary shares 2004 350,814 ordinary shares under the ABIP.
Also during the period, matching awards were made over 9,068 ordinary shares 2004 9,380 ordinary shares under the Share Matching Scheme SMS which is a legacy scheme that is closed to new entrants.
The fair value of awards made under these schemes is measured based on the market price of the Companys ordinary shares on the date of the award.
Where the awards do not attract dividends during the vesting period, the market price is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid during the expected life of the awards.
The weighted average fair value of awards made during the period was 257.86p 2004 253.14p.
Awards made under these schemes are classified as equity-settled awards.
The compensation expense recognised during the period was 0.8 million 2004 0.5 million.
