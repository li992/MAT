Insurance premium revenue from the e Employee benefits pensions receipt of reinsurance to close 15.3 15.3 Within the Group there are a number of different pension schemes, including two defined benefit schemes, one of which is a multi-employer scheme.
Reinsurance premium ceded 159.6 1.7 161.3 Under UK GAAP the Group accounts for its defined benefit pension schemes in accordance with SSAP 24, Accounting for pension costs.
Both SSAP Net insurance premium revenue 696.3 26.1 15.3 737.7 24 and IAS 19, Employee benefits, permit the multi-employer scheme to be accounted for as a defined contribution scheme subject to satisfying certain Investment return 52.5 0.7 0.3 52.1 conditions.
The Group believes these conditions are satisfied.
Accounting for defined contribution schemes does not change under IFRS.

Adjustments are made for surpluses or deficits that arise under the SSAP 24 basis of Insurance claims and loss adjustment valuation.

IAS 19 does permit cumulative gains or losses that lie within a defined corridor to not be recognised.
However, Amlin plc does not currently Net insurance claims 379.2 15.3 394.5 intend to apply this corridor approach to valuing pension deficits.
Expenses for the acquisition of insurance contracts 158.4 5.8 2.5 161.7 An amendment was issued to IAS 19 in December 2004 which, subject to endorsement by the EC, requires that if there is a contractual agreement Expenses for asset management fees 1.3 1.3 between employers in a multi-employer defined benefit scheme, that is accounted for as a defined contribution scheme, as to how a surplus should be Other operating expenses 89.4 13.9 3.1 0.5 0.4 4.9 106.0 distributed or a deficit funded, then that surplus or deficit shall be recognised as an asset or a liability.

h Valuation of financial investments a Foreign exchange accounting for non-monetary assets and liabilities Under UK GAAP, the Groups financial investments have been carried at the mid-price quoted on the balance sheet date.
IAS 39, Financial investments: IAS 21, The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, requires foreign currency denominated non-monetary assets, liabilities and transactions recognition and measurement, requires the Groups financial investments to be valued at fair value which is deemed to be the bid-price.
i. e. those without a corresponding cash flow, being principally the unearned premium reserve, the reinsurers share of the unearned premium reserve Under IFRS the Groups financial investments are categorised as fair value through profit and loss.
Accordingly, all gains realised and unrealised will be and deferred acquisition costs to be converted to the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the original transaction or an passed through the income statement.

Furthermore, any movement in a non-monetary asset or liability that was account.
IFRS 2, Share-based payments, requires the cost of all share-based payments to be charged against profits over their respective vesting recognised through the profit and loss account was converted using the average exchange rate for the period in which it was recognised in the profit periods.
j Discounting of debtors and creditors due after more than one year b Accounting for reinsurance to close RITC Under IFRS debtors and creditors that fall due outside of one year from the balance sheet date excluding deferred tax assets and liabilities must be Prior to the adoption of IFRS the RITC contract was accrued for at the year end, even though it was normally not finalised until after the year end.
To the discounted to their net present value at the balance sheet date using an appropriate discount rate.
Discounting of such items is not required under extent that Amlins share of capacity increases from one year to the next this gave rise to a debtor and an equal increase in liabilities.
Following the transfer to IFRS the RITC is accounted for in the period in which the contract is finalised.
The debtor and the increase in liabilities that k Service companies previously existed is therefore now eliminated.
In addition, the Group is now disclosing as premium income the amount of the RITC received relating to Prior to the adoption of IFRS the Group did not consolidate all of its service companies.
Instead net transactions were processed through the syndicate the increase in capacity for one year of account to the next.
An equivalent increase in claims is also recorded.
IAS27, Consolidated and separate financial statements, requires that the service companies are consolidated on the basis that they are controlled by the Group.
These adjustments have no net effect on reported profits and net assets.
c Dividend accrual Under UK GAAP the Group accrued for the final dividend in the period in which the profits to which it related were recognised.
Under IAS 10, Events after the balance sheet date, a dividend should only be recognised in the period in which it is declared and becomes a present obligation of the Group.
