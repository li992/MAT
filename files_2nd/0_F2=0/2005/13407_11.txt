Statement of directors responsibilities on the consolidated financial statements Company law requires the directors to prepare consolidated financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and of the profit or loss of the group for that year.
In preparing those consolidated financial statements the directors are required to: i Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
ii Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
iii State that the consolidated financial statements comply with IFRS.
iv Prepare the consolidated financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group will continue in business.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and to enable them to ensure that the consolidated financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
