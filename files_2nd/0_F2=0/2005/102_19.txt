The subsidiaries are companies controlled by 888 Holdings Public Limited Company.
Control exists where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the parent gained control until such time as control ceases.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements using the purchase method of accounting.
On the date of the acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values and any excess of the fair value of the acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company and using consistent accounting policies.
c Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
d Net Gaming Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Net Gaming Revenue is defined as follows: Casino Casino winnings that are the differences between the amounts of bets placed by members less amounts won by members.
Poker Ring games: Rake, which is the commission charged from each winning hand played.
Tournaments: Entry fees charged for participation in poker tournaments.

The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from US dollars are translated into the presentation currency as follows: i monetary assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: ii income and expenses for each income statement are translated at an average exchange rate unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions : and iii exchange rate differences on translation of Group entities that have functional currencies different from US dollars are included in administrative expenses.

IAS 38 Intangible Assets requires capitalisation of certain software development costs, subsequent to technological and commercial feasibility being established and the Group having sufficient resources to complete development.
Based on the Groups product-development process, technological feasibility and therefore the creation of substantially improved product, is only established upon the completion of a working model.
The Group generally does not incur any significant costs between the completion of the working model and the point at which the product is ready for general release.
g Taxation The tax expense represents tax payable for the year based on currently applicable tax rates.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet differs from its tax base.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities assets are settled recovered.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
h Intangible assets All intangible assets are initially recognised at cost.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all intangible assets, evenly over their expected useful lives, and the charge is included within operating expenses.
Intangible assets are reviewed annually for evidence of impairment.
The annual amortisation rates are as follows: Domain names: 10% i Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation.
Carrying amounts are reviewed at each balance sheet date for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of the assets less their estimated residual values over their expected useful lives.
The annual depreciation rates are as follows: IT equipment 33% Office furniture and equipment 715% Motor vehicles 15% Leasehold improvements Over the shorter of the term of the lease or useful lives.
j Impairment of non-financial assets Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually on 31 December.
Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount i. e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the assets cash generating unit i. e. the lowest group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
k Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the original transaction value and principally comprise amounts due from the credit-card companies and from e-payment companies.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.

Certain risks are managed centrally, while others are managed locally following guidelines communicated from the centre.
The policy for each of these risks is detailed below.
Currency risk The Groups overall financial risk arising from exchange rate fluctuations to the Group is minimal as receipts and the majority of payments are transacted in US dollars.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate risk is limited to the interest bearing deposits in which the Group invests surplus funds.
