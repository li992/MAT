The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash flows over an instruments expected life to its net carrying value.
It takes into account all fees and points paid that are an integral part of the yield, transaction costs and all other premiums and discounts.

If a hedged item is the hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity.
In a fair value derecognised the related non-trading derivative is remeasured hedge the gain or loss on the derivative is recognised in profit at fair value and any gain or loss taken to the income or loss as it arises offset by the corresponding gain or loss on statement.

In a cash flow hedge and in the hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity, the element of the derivatives gain or loss that is an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity.
The ineffective element is taken to the income statement.
Certain conditions must be met for a relationship to qualify for hedge accounting.
These include designation, documentation and prospective and actual hedge effectiveness.
On implementation of IAS 39, nontrading derivatives were remeasured at fair value.
Embedded derivatives are not bifurcated from the host A derivative embedded in a contract is accounted for as a contract.
