In particular, the standards IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4, which address the measurement of financial instruments and insurance contract assets and liabilities have been applied from 1 January 2005 rather than, as applied for all other IFRS standards, 1 January 2004.
The pro forma IFRS results shown above are extracted from supplementary information and are not results that form part of the Groups financial statements.
The pro forma IFRS results reflect the application of the statutory IFRS basis together with the estimated effect on the Groups results for 2004 if IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4 had been applied from 1 January 2004 to the Groups insurance operations, but not to the Groups banking operations, in particular in relation to hedge accounting.
EEV basis results The EEV basis results are extracted from supplementary information and are not results that form part of the Groups financial statements.
Supplementary information The results shown above distinguish operating profits based on longer-term investment returns from profits before tax.
The reconciling items are presented in accordance with the Groups policy as described in the Groups financial statements and supplementary information.
Items excluded from operating profit based on longer-term investment returns represent primarily the effects of altered investment market conditions short-term fluctuations, actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes, and exceptional items, including goodwill impairment.
For EEV, the operating profit based on longer-term investment returns figure also excludes the effect of changes in economic assumptions and the time value of the cost of options and guarantees.
