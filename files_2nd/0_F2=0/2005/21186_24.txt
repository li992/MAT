Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 106 Financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards continued 6 Longer-term investment return The Group has chosen to revisit its longer-term investment return LTIR methodology from 2005 as part of a discretionary change not required by IFRS.
In order to provide suitable trend analysis, the 2004 comparatives are presented in accordance with this new methodology.
The key changes are as follows: For properties and equity, we have applied lower start of year long-term rates of investment return consistent with those adopted for reporting life operating returns under EEV principles.
This would have reduced operating profit in 2004 by 25 million: For xed income securities, we have included the amortisation of the premium or discount arising upon acquisition of a bond within our LTIR calculation.
This would have reduced operating profit before tax by 72 million in 2004: The LTIR is only being applied to general insurance and health business.
These changes have no effect on profit before tax.
vi Reconciliation of the cash ows reported under UK GAAP to cash ows reported under IFRS Under UK GAAP, as amended by the ABI SORP for insurance companies, the consolidated statement of cash ows presents only the cash ows of general insurance business and shareholders funds.
Cash ows of the long-term business, other than amounts transferred to shareholders, are not included in this statement.
IAS 7, Cash Flow Statements, requires the cash ow statement to include cash ows from all activities of the Group, including the reconciliation of cash ows from operating activities to profit or loss reported in the income statement.
Other differences arise between the UK cash ow statements and IFRS, mainly due to reclassication of items under IFRS.
For the year ended 31 December 2004, the only material differences between the cash ow statements prepared under the two bases were the inclusion of cash ows from the Groups long-term businesses and from newly-consolidated securitisation vehicles and investment vehicles, together with changes arising from the different denitions of cash and cash equivalents under these bases.
2 Exchange rates The Groups principal overseas operations are located within the Eurozone.
The results and cash ows of these operations have been translated into sterling at an average rate for the year of 1 euro 0.68 2004: 1 euro 0.68 and their assets and liabilities have been translated at the year-end rate of 1 euro 0.69 2004: 1 euro 0.71.
Total foreign currency movements during 2005 resulted in a loss recognised in the income statement of 203 million 2004: 31 million gain.
3 Subsidiaries a Acquisitions i RAC plc On 4 May 2005, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of RAC plc.
The results of RAC plcs operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group with effect from 4 May 2005, and contributed 15 million to the consolidated profit before tax.
m Purchase cost Cash paid 566 Fair value of 88 million shares issued, based on their published price at date of exchange average of 6.03 per share 530 Costs attributable 17 Total 1,113 The issue of new shares in the Company in exchange for shares in RAC plc has attracted merger relief under section 131 of the Companies Act 1985.
Of the 530 million above, 22 million has been credited to share capital see note 27 b and 508 million has been credited to the merger reserve, increasing that reserve from 2,763 million to 3,271 million.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 107 3 Subsidiaries continued The assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition were: Fair value and Pension accounting Revaluation scheme policy Book value of Intangibles valuation adjustments Fair value m m m m m Assets Intangible assets 59 333 392 Tax assets 58 58 Other assets 608 38 646 Total assets 725 333 20 1,038 Liabilities Provisions Pension deficit 257 56 313 Other 8 14 22 Tax liabilities 118 17 83 18 Other liabilities 708 3 711 Total liabilities 973 118 39 66 1,064 Net assets acquired 248 215 39 46 26 Goodwill including 118 million arising from the creation of the deferred tax liability on intangibles 1,139 Intangible assets 392 Total goodwill and intangible assets 1,531 Less: deferred tax liability 118 Total value of goodwill and intangible assets net of associated tax included on balance sheet 1,413 Separable intangible assets have been identied and valued by an independent third party at 392 million, using estimated post-tax cash ows and post-tax discount rates.
The Group has assessed the useful economic lives of these intangibles, considering relevant factors such as usage of the asset, typical product life cycles, potential obsolescence, maintenance costs, the stability of the industry, competitive position, and the period of control over the assets.
In the case of the RAC and BSM brands, it has been determined that the existing lives of the assets, their competitive position in and the stability of their respective markets indicate that the brands have indefinite useful lives, and thus no amortisation has been charged in the period since acquisition.
Of the total 392 million, 260 million has been assessed as having an indefinite life, with the remaining 132 million, mainly contractual customer relationships, being amortised over nine to 22 years.
A deferred tax liability of 118 million has been provided against these intangible assets, resulting in an increase in residual goodwill by this amount.
Although this liability has been recognised in accordance with IAS 12, and a proportion will be amortised to the income statement as the related intangible asset is amortised, this liability is only payable if the intangible asset is sold separately and this is not expected to happen.
The pension scheme valuation adjustment and associated deferred taxation represents the effect of aligning the assumptions of the RAC plc schemes to those of Aviva.
The fair value of the RAC pension deficit at the date of acquisition amounted to 313 million 219 million after deferred tax.
The residual goodwill of 1,139 million essentially represents synergies, both in increased revenues and in reduced costs, expected to arise in RAC plc and our UK general insurance business as a result of the acquisition.
109 million of integration costs for the restructuring of the combined Norwich Union Insurance and RAC businesses has been included in the results to 31 December 2005. ii Gresham Insurance Company Limited On 31 March 2005, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Gresham Insurance Company Limited.
The cash consideration including purchase costs was 75 million.
The fair value of the net assets acquired, including intangibles of 14 million, was 75 million, giving rise to no goodwill on acquisition.
iii Solus Automotive Limited On 11 May 2005, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Solus Automotive Limited.
The cash consideration including purchase costs was 20 million, including 12 million of cash and 8 million of deferred consideration.
The fair value of the net assets acquired was nil, giving rise to 20 million of goodwill on acquisition.

v Non-adjusting post-balance sheet events: Irish bancassurance agreement On 22 November 2005, the Group announced a new bancassurance agreement in Ireland between its wholly-owned subsidiary Hibernian Group plc Hibernian and Allied Irish Banks plc AIB.
This will create a leading force in the Irish life and pensions market and bring further opportunities for growth in this market.
The transaction completed on 27 January 2006, following the receipt of regulatory and European Commission approval.
Under the terms of the agreement, Hibernian Life Holdings Limited HLH, the parent company of Hibernian Life & Pensions Limited, has acquired all the shares of Ark Life Assurance Company Limited Ark Life from AIB in exchange for a 24.99% stake in the enlarged HLH and a balancing cash payment of a195.4 million which also reects the management of Ark Life funds by Hibernian Investment Managers Limited, part of the Groups fund management business.
A further deferred cash payment of up to a10 million is payable, subject to the fullment of certain performance criteria.
AIB calculate embedded value on a different basis to that used by the Group and, in particular, do not use EEV principles.
In view of the very recent timing of completion, it is currently impractical to comply with the requirements of paragraph 67 of IFRS 3, Business Combinations, and to state with any certainty the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired, and therefore to estimate the goodwill arising on this acquisition and the unrealised gain on disposal of the Groups 24.99% interest in HLH.
The gain on disposal of this interest in HLH will be calculated in accordance with SIC 13, Jointly Controlled Entities Non-Monetary Contributions by Venturers, and will be recognised in 2006.
Acquisition in Sri Lanka On 1 February 2006, the Group acquired a 51% interest in Eagle Insurance Limited Eagle, the third largest insurer in Sri Lanka, by buying a majority shareholding in Eagles immediate holding company, NDB Finance Lanka Pvt Limited, for cash of 15 million.
At the same time, Eagle has entered into a bancassurance agreement with National Development Bank Limited NDB, Sri Lankas biggest development bank and Eagles other major shareholder.
In view of the very recent timing of completion, it is currently impractical to comply with the requirements of paragraph 67 of IFRS 3, Business Combinations, and to state with any certainty the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired, and therefore to estimate the goodwill arising on this acquisition.
b Disposals of subsidiaries and associates The profit on disposal was determined as follows: 2005 2004 m m Proceeds from sale 421 327 Net assets sold 245 293 Transaction costs 23 profit on disposal before tax 153 34 Tax on profit on disposal 43 profit on disposal after tax 110 34 Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 109 3 Subsidiaries continued The profit loss on the disposal of subsidiaries and associates comprises: 2005 2004 m m General insurance businesses United Kingdom 10 28 France 6 Asia see below 122 Other small operations 22 110 34 i Sale of Asian general insurance businesses During 2005, the Group completed the disposal of its Asian general insurance businesses to Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance MSI for a total of US$450 million in cash.
Under the terms of the agreement, MSI acquired all of Avivas general insurance businesses in Asia.
These comprised the general insurance business of Aviva Limited and the general insurance assets of Aviva Asia Pte Limited in Singapore: Aviva Insurance Berhad in Malaysia including its branch in Brunei : Aviva Insurance Thai Company Limited in Thailand: PT Aviva Insurance in Indonesia: Dah Sing General Insurance Co Limited in Hong Kong: and Avivas branch operations in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Marianas, Macau and Taiwan.
The transaction was achieved through share purchase of Avivas interests in joint venture operations, business purchase and asset purchase in Singapore, and transfer of Avivas general insurance branch operations in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Marianas, Macau and Taiwan.
The transaction completed in two phases.
Phase I completed on 28 February 2005 and included all businesses above except for Malaysia, Indonesia, Macau, Marianas, Taiwan, Dah Sing and the Philippines.
Phase II completed in December 2005, when the last of these businesses was sold, with the exception of Taiwan which completed in February 2006.
Due to its immateriality, this last disposal has been treated as a 2005 transaction.
The total sale proceeds were xed by reference to the net assets of the businesses as at 31 December 2003 and were not adjusted to reect the results in the period from 1 January 2004 to completion.
The Group therefore hedged its exposure to the sale proceeds of US$450 million through the purchase of foreign currency forward contracts.
The Group did not bear any continuing operating risk from 31 December 2003.
The results of the Asian general insurance business have been consolidated with those of the Groups ongoing operations until the completion of each transaction.
Although the Group retained no economic interest in the operations of this business beyond 31 December 2003, the post-tax operating profits have been incorporated in the Groups consolidated income statement from 1 January 2004 to the date of completion.
This has been offset by a corresponding change to the final profit on sale.
The total pre-tax profit on sale was 165 million 122 million after tax and is summarised below: 2005 m Net assets as at 31 December 2003 60 Post-tax operating profit to disposal 14 Dividends paid 5 Foreign exchange rate movements on net assets 4 Net assets at disposal 73 Proceeds 256 Less: Net assets 73 Transaction costs 18 Pre-tax profit on sale 165 Tax attributable to profit on sale 43 Post-tax profit on sale 122 The net assets at disposal of 73 million, comprised financial investments 220 million and other assets 95 million, less insurance liabilities 207 million and other liabilities 35 million.
