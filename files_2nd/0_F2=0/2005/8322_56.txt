g Fair values of financial assets and liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all the Groups financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2004: 31 December 2004 Carrying amount Fair value m m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Group's operations Financial assets 1,197 1,197 Current liability loans and bonds 100 100 Non-current liabilities excluding deferred tax 3,477 3,508 In addition to the above, the Group holds energy derivatives for trading purposes with a carrying amount and fair value of 3 million gross gain of 37 million, gross loss of 34 million.
Financial assets in the above table comprise finance lease receivables, other long-term receivables, assets held for trading and cash and cash equivalents.
Finance lease receivables and other long-term receivables have been estimated by discounting estimated cash flows.
The carrying amount of assets held for trading and cash and cash equivalents approximates to fair value because of their short maturity.
The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values of financial instruments are as follows: i Current asset trade and other receivables and current liability trade and other payables are excluded from the above table.
Their carrying amounts approximate to fair value because of their short maturity.
ii The fair value of assets held for trading maturing after three months has been estimated using discounted cash flows and quoted market prices.
iii The fair value of current liability loans and bonds approximates to carrying amount because of their short maturity.
iv The fair value of non-current liability loans and bonds and interest rate swaps has been calculated using market prices when available or the net present value of future cash flows arising.
v The fair value of the Groups forward exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and foreign currency options has been calculated using the market rates in effect at the balance sheet dates.
vi The fair value of energy derivatives is measured using value at risk and other methodologies that provide a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy products.
Within the above fair values, only the financial assets and liabilities have been marked to market.
