Note that the adjustments are net of the associated tax impact.
Note 1: Inclusion of amounts previously netted Under IFRS, the Group has elected to move to trade date accounting for certain financial instruments held within the banking segment.
The Group has also made adjustments for amounts previously netted under UK GAAP.
This has resulted in an increase in assets and liabilities of 1,588 million at 31 December 2004.
There is no impact on net equity or profit and loss for the year.
Note 2: Reclassifications The Group has reclassified certain financial assets as available-for-sale AFS which had been classified under UK GAAP as fair value through profit and loss.
This has resulted in a reclassification of profit after tax to the revaluation reserve in equity of 36 million at 31 December 2004.
There is no impact on net equity.
Note 3: Goodwill Under UK GAAP, the Group recognised acquired goodwill at cost and amortised it on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life.
Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortised and is subject to impairment reviews both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Under IFRS 1, the UK GAAP goodwill balance at 1 January 2004 has been carried forward and the amortisation of 83 million charged in the year ended 31 December 2004 has been reversed.
Included in the goodwill balance sheet adjustment is an adjustment to the treatment of goodwill of 154 million at 1 January 2004 with an offsetting adjustment to minority interests within equity of 135 million.
Note 4: Consolidation of funds IFRS requires the consolidation of certain mutual funds and other investment vehicles, which did not previously require consolidation under UK GAAP.
This arises from a more stringent definition of when an entity is considered to be under the control of an investor.
As a result the Group has now consolidated a number of mutual funds and other investment vehicles on a line-by-line basis.
The Group has applied IFRS and consolidated those vehicles that meet the definition of a subsidiary under IFRS.
Old Mutual plc will continue to monitor industry developments in this area.
This has resulted in an increase in total assets and total liabilities of 1,159 million at 31 December 2004 representing that part of the funds owned by third parties.
This third party interest is recorded within liabilities.
The consolidation of mutual funds has no effect on equity or profit after tax.
Note 5: Recognition and valuation of financial instruments Under IFRS, financial instruments have been classified as fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and loans and receivables and fair valued as required.
The fair value movements for these financial instruments have been recognised in the income statement or equity as appropriate.
Available-for-sale fair value adjustments are transferred out of equity to the income statement on sale or impairment.
Derivatives, as required under IFRS, are included in the fair value through profit or loss classification and recognised on the balance sheet at fair value.
Under UK GAAP, the majority of investments within the Groups US Life segment were recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the income statement, while off balance sheet financial instruments were measured on a basis consistent with on balance sheet instruments.
The effect of classifying these assets as available-for-sale under IFRS therefore has no material net impact on equity.
Additionally, under IFRS, the Group has moved to an incurred loss provisioning model within its banking segment.
Under UK GAAP, the Group utilised an expected loss provisioning model.
The implementation of hedge accounting has resulted in a 27 million increase in profit after tax and an 9 million increase in equity at 31 December 2004.
As a result of the stricter designation and documentation requirements and effectiveness testing required to qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39, certain transactions undertaken as hedges under UK GAAP have not qualified for hedge accounting under IFRS and the fair value movements for these derivatives have been accounted for through the income statement.
Unrealised profits and losses on UK GAAP hedges at transition have been included in reserves in accordance with IFRS 1 transitional arrangements.
The impact of the above adjustments is an increase of 89 million to equity at 31 December 2004 and an increase of 48 million to profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2004, mainly representing the cumulative fair value changes on financial instruments, the implementation of the amended loan provisioning model and hedging adjustments.
The Group has elected to designate specific securities that as fair value through the income statement, where the treatment eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise when using a different measurement basis and these items are managed evaluated and reported using a fair value basis.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 197 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 continued 51 TRANSITION TO IFRS GROUP continued Material adjustments continued Note 6: Revenue recognition Under IAS 18, Revenue IAS 18, fees that are directly attributable to securing an investment management service contract are deferred as a liability.
This liability represents the deferred revenue from providing investment management services and is amortised as the related services are provided.
Costs that are directly attributable to securing an investment management service contract are deferred as an asset and expensed in line with the related revenue as the services are provided.
Both the long-term business and asset management segments contain investment management service contracts.
Additionally, the Groups banking segment has recognised fees and costs relating to securing loans in line with IAS 18, resulting in deferred acquisition costs and deferred revenue liability balances on the balance sheet.
Past policy was to expense acquisition costs as incurred and recognise initial fees and recurring fees as received.
The effect on the balance sheet at 31 December 2004 is an increase in assets and liabilities of 124 million and 132 million respectively resulting in a net decrease in equity of 8 million.
Profit after tax has increased by 5 million for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Note 7: Elimination of equalisation provisions Under UK GAAP an equalisation provision is recorded in the financial statements of individual general insurance companies within the Group to eliminate, or reduce, the volatility in incurred claims arising from exceptional levels of claims in certain classes of business.
The provision is required by law even though no actual liability exists at the balance sheet date, with the annual change in the equalisation provision being recorded in the profit and loss account.
Under IFRS 4, the recognition of equalisation provisions is not permitted.
The removal of the equalisation provision results in an increase in equity of 60 million at 31 December 2004 and a related increase of 12 million to profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Note 8: Investment contracts Under IFRS 4, certain contracts previously accounted for as insurance are classified as investment contracts as they do not contain significant insurance risk.
Those that have a discretionary participating feature continue to be accounted for using local GAAP.
Under IAS 39, investment contracts without a discretionary participating feature are carried at either fair value in the case of linked liabilities or amortised cost.
Fair value for these investment contracts is equal to the fair value of the related assets, or the policyholders account balance.
Adjustments to the account balance under the previous basis of accounting for Rand or Sterling reserves and actuarial funding have been reversed.
The effect is to increase investment contract liabilities by 143 million at 31 December 2004 and by 116 million at 1 January 2004, with an impact on profit after tax of 14 million.
Amounts received under investment contracts other than those with a discretionary participating feature are no longer shown as premiums but are treated as deposits and added to investment contract liabilities.
Similarly, amounts paid under investment contracts other than those with a discretionary participating feature are recorded not as claims but as deductions from investment contract liabilities.
This is reflected as a reduction to revenue of 1,312 million and to expenses of 1,294 million for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Note 9: Insurance accounting Under IFRS 4, the Group continues to account for insurance contracts using local GAAP for each Group entity, but has the option to make improvements to its policies if the changes make the financial statements more relevant to the decision-making needs of users.
Insurance business in the United States US continues to be accounted for under US Generally Accepted Accounting Practice US GAAP, and the Group has elected to make certain improvements to its accounting for Deferred Acquisition Costs DAC and Present Value of Future Profits PVFP on insurance contracts.
Under the revised policy, unrealised and actual realised gains are reflected in the amortisation of DAC PVFP.
The net impact of these improvements is to decrease equity by 141 million and 131 million at 31 December 2004 and 1 January 2004 respectively.
Profit after tax is decreased by 3 million for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Note 10: Post-employment benefits Under UK GAAP, post-employment costs were charged to the income statement account so as to spread the related charges over the service lives of employees and were determined by independent qualified actuaries undertaking formal actuarial valuations at least every three years.
In accordance with IAS 19, the projected benefit obligation is matched against the fair value of the underlying assets and other unrecognised actuarial gains and losses in determining the expense for the year.
Any asset or obligation must be recorded in the balance sheet, and separate recognition of the operating and financing costs of defined benefits and similarly funded employee benefits is required in the income statement.
IAS 19 permits a number of options for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
The Group has elected to recognise actuarial gains and losses using the corridor method and take advantage of the IFRS 1 exemption allowing any previously unrecognised actuarial gains or losses to be recognised in full on the balance sheet, at the date of transition 1 January 2004.
The effect of these changes is to increase equity by 21 million and 11 million at 31 December 2004 and 1 January 2004 respectively.
Profit after tax has increased by 9 million for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Old Mutual plc 198 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 51 TRANSITION TO IFRS GROUP continued Material adjustments continued Note 11: Dividend recognition Under UK GAAP, dividends were accrued in the period to which they related regardless of when they were declared and approved.
Under IAS 10, Events after the Balance Sheet Date IAS 10, dividends are only accrued when declared and appropriately approved.
The reversal of accrued dividends has increased equity by 122 million at 31 December 2004.
There is no profit or loss impact.
Note 12: Share-based payments Under UK GAAP, the costs of awards to employees under equity compensation plans, other than Save As You Earn plans, were recognised immediately if they were not conditional on performance criteria.
If the award was conditional, the cost was recognised over the period to which the performance criteria related.
The minimum cost for the award was the difference between the share price of the underlying equity instruments at the date of grant less any contribution required from the employee.
The cost was based on a reasonable expectation of the extent to which the performance criteria would be met.
Any subsequent changes in that expectation were reflected in the income statement.
Under IFRS 2, equity instruments granted under equity-settled awards after 7 November 2002, which remain unvested at 1 January 2005, are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
The fair value of those equity instruments is measured at grant date and is recognised over the vesting period, adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect actual and expected levels of vesting.
Equity instruments granted under cash-settled awards are measured at fair value at each reporting date.
The fair value is recognised over the vesting period and is re-measured until the underlying liability is settled.
Any changes in the fair value are reflected in profit and loss.
The effect of this change in treatment is a decrease in profit after tax of 16 million and a corresponding decrease to equity at 31 December 2004.
There is minimal impact on 1 January 2004 equity primarily due to the IFRS charge being offset by the reversal of related UK GAAP accruals.
Note 13: Consolidation of other entities IFRS does not differentiate between shareholders and policyholders funds.
Assets and liabilities, and income and expenditure items between group companies and policyholders funds have now been eliminated on consolidation.
Additionally, under IFRS, a charitable foundation has now been consolidated in the Groups preliminary financial information.
The effect is to decrease assets and liabilities by 1,086 million and 1,108 million respectively at 31 December 2004.
Profit after tax decreased by 2 million for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Note 14: Elimination of policyholder investments in Nedbank IFRS does not recognise the distinction between shareholder and policyholder investments and as a result the Group has eliminated certain policyholder investments in its Banking subsidiary, not previously eliminated under UK GAAP.
This has resulted in a decrease of 195 million and 133 million to assets and liabilities at 31 December 2004 respectively.
Profit after tax decreased by 12 million in the year ended 31 December 2004.
Note 15: Reclassification of policyholder loans Certain policyholder loans have been offset against investment contract liabilities in accordance with IAS 32 as the Group has both the contractual ability and right to offset and intends to settle on a net basis.
The effect is to decrease assets by 349 million at 30 June 2004 and by 314 million at 1 January 2004.
There is no equity or profit after tax impact.
This adjustment was made within the UK GAAP balance sheet at 31 December 2004 and therefore does not feature in the IFRS reconciliation at 31 December 2004.
Note 16: Valuation of embedded derivatives IFRS 4 requires that embedded derivatives within insurance contracts be separated and fair valued if the derivatives do not qualify as insurance contracts.
The overall effect of the embedded derivatives adjustment is to decrease net equity by 1 million at 31 December 2004 and 28 million at 1 January 2004.
Profit after tax increased by 26 million for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Note 17: Other items The other changes that arise as a result of the transition to IFRS are principally reclassifications and presentational changes, which individually and collectively have an immaterial effect on the Groups equity and profit after tax.
Other items principally comprise of: Properties previously held at cost which have been reclassified under IFRS as owner occupied properties and restated to depreciated fair value accordingly.
This has resulted in a net increase to equity of 22 million at 31 December 2004 and an associated decrease to profit after tax of 4 million: An adjustment under IAS 21 to reflect the transfer directly to equity of foreign exchange gains or losses incurred by entities with a non-Rand functional currency.
Profit after tax has increased by 10 million.
There is no impact on equity.
To reflect more accurately the banking margin on banking assets by excluding trading activities, certain trading revenues have been reclassified from net interest income to non-interest revenue, and interest income items have been reclassified to interest expenses.
In aggregate these adjustments resulted in a 34 million decrease to equity and a 5 million increase to profit after tax respectively at 31 December 2004.
