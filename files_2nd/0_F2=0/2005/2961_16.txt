b Estimated total cost of the completed ship includes the contract price with the shipyard, design and engineering fees, capitalized interest, construction oversight costs and various owner supplied items.
All of our ship construction contracts are with the Fincantieri shipyards in Italy, except for AIDAs which are with the Meyer Werft shipyard in Germany.
In addition, the estimated total cost reflects the currency denomination that we are committed to expend, including the effect of foreign currency swaps.
c These construction contracts aggregating $2.26 billion were entered into in December 2005. d These construction contracts are denominated in euros, except for $45 million of the Queen Victoria costs, which are denominated in USD.
The euro denominated contract amounts have been fixed into U. S. dollars or sterling by utilizing foreign currency swaps.
e These construction contracts are denominated in euros, which is the functional currency of the cruise line which will operate the ship and, therefore, we do not expect to enter into foreign currency swaps to hedge these commitments.
f The estimated total costs of these contracts denominated in euros and sterling have been translated into U. S. dollars using the November 30, 2005 exchange rate.
