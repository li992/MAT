Financial instruments The Company has established objectives concerning the holding and use of financial instruments which are discussed in further detail in the Treasury Management section of the Financial Review on page 22.
The key objective is to manage the financial risks faced by the Company, which are discussed below.
Formal policies and guidelines have been set to achieve this objective and it is the responsibility of Group Treasury to implement these policies using the strategies set out below.
The Company does not trade in financial instruments nor engage in speculative arrangements and it is the Companys policy not to use any complex financial instruments, unless, in exceptional circumstances, it is necessary to cover defined risks.
The Company adopted FRS26 from 1 January 2005.
Therefore it should be noted that the comparative information provided in this note is not comparable with the 2005 information.
Management of financial risk The Company considers its major financial risks to be currency risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.
The Companys policies with regard to these risks and the strategies concerning how financial instruments are used to manage these risks are set out below.
Currency risk The Company monitors transactional currency exposures and sources hedging opportunities to reduce foreign exchange risk using approved markets and instruments.

Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Companys objective of ensuring that adequate funding is in place is achieved by having agreed sufficient committed bank facilities.
The Companys principal debt instruments are subject to certain financial covenants.
At 31 December 2005, the Company had net debt before issue costs of new debt of 505.9 million 2004: 412.0 million.
The Company had cash and cash equivalents of 1.9 million at 31 December 2005 2004: 4.9 million and gross borrowings of 507.8 million 2004: 416.9 million.
Included within gross borrowings is 121.5 million 2004: 122.6million of 2 per cent convertible bonds due in 2006.
These bonds were issued on 15 May 2002.
Also included within gross borrowings is 92.9 million US$160 million 2004: 83.0 million US$160 million of unsecured loan notes issued on 20 November 2000 which are repayable in full between 2006 and 2008, and 198.5 million US$342 million 2004: nil of unsecured loan notes issued on 28 July 2005 which are repayable in full between 2012 and 2017.
In addition to the net debt at 31 December 2005, the Company has undrawn committed facilities of 294.9 million 2004: 231.6 million.
Interest rate risk The Companys convertible bond and the unsecured loan notes, referred to above, are at fixed rates.
All other borrowings are at floating rates.
The Company has in place cash pooling arrangements in the United Kingdom.
These enable the Company to minimise the interest paid on short-term borrowings and overdrafts, whilst allowing net surplus funds to be invested in interest bearing accounts.
Credit Risk The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high creditratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Convertible bond On 15 May 2002, the Company issued 165 million of convertible bonds, due in 2006.
The bonds may be redeemed, at the option of the Company, at any time on or after 29 May 2005.
Unless previously redeemed, the bonds are convertible into ordinary 5p shares, at the option of the holder, between 25 June 2002 and 8 May 2006.
Unless previously redeemed or converted, the bonds will be redeemed on 15 May 2006 at 107.95% of their principal amount.
The initial conversion price was 149.8 pence per ordinary share and is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances relating to changes in the capital structure of the Company or a change of control.
If all the bonds were to be converted at the initial conversion price, 67.5 million ordinary shares would be issued.
Interest is payable on the bonds at 2 per cent per annum with a 1.875 per cent premium payable.
The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible bond have been split between the host contract liability element and an equity conversion component, representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Company.
The equity conversion component is separately included within liabilities.
This component is then marked to market at each balance sheet date with changes in fair value being taken through the income statement.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the host contract liability component was valued at 91.1 million, excluding unamortised issue costs, and the equity conversion component was 11.9 million.
At 31 December 2005, the host contract liability component was 121.5 million 1 January 2005: 122.6 million, excluding unamortised issue costs, and the equity conversion component was nil 1 January 2005: 0.3 million.
Issue costs are deducted from the amount of funds received and amortised over the term of the debt.

Private Placement Debt July 2005 On 28 July 2005, the Company issued US$342 million of unsecured loan notes, repayable between 2012 and 2017.
On 9 November 2005 cross currency swaps were entered into for US$142m of the loan notes due in 2012 and US$50m of the loan notes due in 2015 to convert this US$ fixed rate borrowing into EUR fixed rate borrowing.
Cross currency swaps The fair value of the cross currency swaps entered into at 31 December 2005 is 1.6 million.
The fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model and market interest yield curves applicable and represents movements in the Euro US$ foreign exchange spot rate and in Euro and US$ interest rate yields.
The cross currency swaps are synthetically split to reflect the Groups functional currency of Sterling.
The US$ Sterling leg of the swaps act as cash flow hedges against the Groups US$ loan notes and the Euro Sterling leg of the swaps act as net investment hedges in respect of certain of the Groups Euro-denominated investments.
