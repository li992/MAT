The principal financial instruments used by the Group to finance its operations are cash and loans.
The significant financial risks faced by the Group and the policies that it applies are considered below.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
Over the past year the Group has used a limited range of derivative financial instruments and forward contracts to hedge its exposure to US dollar rates and Jet A1 fuel costs.
The Group has not used any financial instruments to hedge its exposure to other foreign currencies and interest rate fluctuations, although natural hedges limit the exposures to these risks.
The primary hedging approach implemented has been to limit exposure to significant adverse movements in US dollar exchange rates and Jet A1 fuel costs using a range of option products.
In addition, forward contracts for jet fuel requirements were used in the second half of the reporting period.
The level of hedging cover taken during the year has been up to 80% of projected cash flows for US dollar and up to 80% for Jet A1 fuel on a one year horizon, and to hedge a smaller percentage of estimated expense up to 36 months in advance.
At 30 September 2005, the hedging in place included a range of options on US dollar sterling and Jet A1 fuel.
For the purposes of this note, other than currency disclosures, the only debtors and creditors included are bank and shareholder loans, in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 13, Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments.
