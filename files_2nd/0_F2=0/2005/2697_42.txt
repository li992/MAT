Borrowings Group un-drawn debt facilities The Group maintains certain committed floating rate facilities with banks as support for its debt capital markets programme.
The un-drawn committed facilities available to the Group are as follows: Expiring within 1 year Expiring in 1 to 2 years Expiring beyond 2 years but less than 5 years 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 m m m m m m Un-drawn Committed Syndicated Facility 1,000 1,042 Un-drawn Committed Subsidiary Facilities 110 31 110 31 1,000 1,042 The un-drawn committed syndicated facility for 1,000 million expires in 2010.
The margins payable on drawings under this facility are between 22.5 basis points and 38 basis points per annum and commitment fees on un-drawn amounts are between 6.75 basis points and 11.4 basis points per annum.
The Group is subject to a restrictive covenant under the facility agreement requiring that the ratio of EBITDA to adjusted net interest both as defined in the agreement, calculated as at the end of each year will be no less than 3.5:1 for the period of approximately 12 months ending on the last day of the year.
The Group is currently in compliance with this covenant.
For the 2005 financial year-end the ratio was 6.8 times 2004: 6.2 times.
These facilities are subject to customary events of default, none of which are currently anticipated to occur.
The commercial paper back-up facilities are annual facilities subject to review at various dates during each year.
In addition, there are other uncommitted facilities available to the Group.
The security for the borrowings shown above as secured is by way of charges on the properties of Group companies concerned.
124 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts 2005 Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
At year end, there was 126 million cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by subsidiary companies that cannot be remitted to the Company due to local reserve bank controls.
The Notes listed above are issued out of the Group's US Debt Programme and EMTN Programme.
Both Programmes are subject to standard debt covenants requiring all debt to be ranked pari passu.
Both Programmes contain customary negative pledge and cross default clauses.
In addition the Group is required to prepare audited annual accounts.
The Group is currently in compliance with these requirements.
The interest rates on the Notes in the above table do not take into account the various interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps entered into by the Group.
Details of the Group's effective currency and interest rate profiles are contained on page 126.
The Groups borrowing limit at 1 January 2006 calculated in accordance with the Articles of Association was 11,688 million.
The 3.875% USD Notes due 2008 and the 5.125% USD Notes due 2013 are both callable at the issuer's option.
These notes are redeemable at the higher of 100% of the face value of the notes or the net present value of the remaining cash flows using a discount factor comprised of the US Treasury rate plus 2025 basis points respectively.
Interest on unsecured bank loans is at rates which vary in accordance with local inter-bank rates.
The weighted average interest rate payable at year end on short-term borrowings excluding overdrafts was 5.1% 2004: 5.3%.
The amount of non-interest bearing loans is negligible.

These fixed rate borrowings expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Other borrowings in the form of overdrafts, commercial paper, bank loans and loan notes 16% were arranged at floating rates, therefore exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group has a policy of matching cross currency and interest rate swaps to the maturity of the underlying debt.
Therefore the maturity profile in the above table represents the interest repricing profile for fixed rate debt.
