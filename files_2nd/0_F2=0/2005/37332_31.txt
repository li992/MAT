Defined benefit schemes Land Securities Scheme The Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies the Scheme is the most significant defined benefit pension scheme of the Group.
The Scheme, which is closed to new entrants and which is non-contributory for employees, provides defined benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the Scheme are held in a selfadministered trust fund which is separate from the Groups assets.
Contributions to the Scheme are determined by a qualified independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
As the Scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost will be expected to increase as a percentage of salary, under the projected unit method, as members approach retirement.
The last formal actuarial valuation, undertaken for the purposes of setting the ongoing contribution rate, was carried out as at 1 July 2003.
At valuation 1 July 2003 % The key assumptions adopted for this valuation were as follows: Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.75 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.50 Discount rate Prior to retirement 6.00 In retirement 5.00 Inflation 2.50 Actuarial value of assets % of market value 95.00 The deficit in the Scheme has increased from 1.2m as at 6 April 2001 to 22.0m as at 1 July 2003 and this decline has been reflected in the FRS17 figures disclosed in previous years.
This increase is primarily due to the sharp fall in equity markets over that period a fall of some 20% and an increase in actuarial expectations of life expectancy.
The market value of the Schemes invested assets excluding the value of annuities purchased to provide certain pensions in payment as at 1 July 2003 was 65.5m.
The actuarial value of these assets represented 79% of the value of the Schemes liabilities at that date.
As a result of this valuation, the actuary recommended that the employer contributions of 30% of pensionable salary be continued together with additional employer contributions to address the deficit.
In order to address the deficit in the Scheme, the Group made an additional one-off cash contribution of 7.5m in March 2003 together with the first payment of an additional annual contribution of 1.5m recommended by the Schemes actuary.
Further annual contributions of 1.5m were made in March 2004 and March 2005.
In September 2004 the Group made a further one-off cash contribution of 10.0m to improve the funding position of the Scheme.
The 7.5m contribution paid in March 2003 and the 10.0m contribution paid in September 2004 are being amortised and charged to the profit and loss account over 10 years, the estimated remaining service life of the Schemes active members.
The pension charges in 2004 and 2005 reflect the amortisation and the 1.5m additional annual contributions as variations from regular costs.
Employer contributions will continue at 30% of pensionable salaries until completion of the next formal valuation, due no later than 1 July 2006.
BBC Trillium Plan The Group participated in the BBC pension scheme until 31 March 2003 in respect of 168 employees who transferred from the BBC to Land Securities Trillium Media Services Limited as part of the Land Securities Trilliums outsourcing contracts with the BBC.
With effect from 1 April 2003, Land Securities Trillium Media Services Limited put in place a defined benefit scheme with the same terms and conditions as the BBC pension scheme for the employees who transferred from the BBC the BBC Trillium Plan.
As at 31 March 2005 the BBC Trillium Plan had assets of 13.4m 2004: 11.1m.
This includes a bulk transfer payment of 8.1m that was received from the BBC pension scheme in May 2004.

This scheme is included within the BBC Trillium Plan.
The assets and liabilities in respect of the BBC Trillium Plan have been included in the consolidated FRS17 disclosure below.
Contributory money purchase scheme A contributory money purchase scheme was introduced on 1 January 1999 for all new administrative and senior property based employees, subject to eligibility, together with a separate similar scheme, effective 1 April 1998, for other property based employees.
A further separate similar scheme, previously set up by Trillium, is also in operation for Land Securities Trillium employees.
