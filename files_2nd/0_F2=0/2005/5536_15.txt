Notes to the Accounts at 30 September 2005 1 Accounting Policies Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified to include the revaluation of properties and have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Enterprise Inns plc and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 30 September each year.
No Profit and Loss Account is presented for Enterprise Inns plc as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Interest rate swaps The Groups criteria for accounting for interest rate swaps as hedges are: The instrument must be related to an asset or a liability: and It must change the character of the interest rate by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa.
Interest rate swaps are fair valued at each year-end for disclosure in the accounts.
Swaps are shown on the balance sheet at fair value at acquisition and are not adjusted to reflect the revised revaluation at each year end.
Fair value is amortised during each year in relation to the remaining life of the instrument.
If a swap is terminated early, the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the Profit and Loss Account.
Where part or whole of a swap does not qualify as an effective hedge, the onerous element is held at market value.
This market value may be wholly or partially offset by that amount of fair value already held on the balance sheet.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 1998 was written off against reserves.
Goodwill previously eliminated against reserves has not been reinstated on implementation of FRS 10.
Positive goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 October 1998 is capitalised, classified as an asset on the Balance Sheet and amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life up to a presumed maximum of 20 years.
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If a subsidiary is subsequently sold, any goodwill arising on acquisition that was written off directly to reserves or that has not been amortised through the Profit and Loss Account is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Expenditure on additions and improvements to tangible fixed assets is capitalised as the expenditure is incurred.
Substantially all of the Groups licensed estate is valued each year reflecting their trading potential on an existing use basis.
Surpluses arising from the professional valuation of the licensed estate are taken direct to the revaluation reserve.
Valuation surpluses realised on sale are transferred from the revaluation reserve to the Profit and Loss Account reserve.
Any deficit arising from the professional valuation of properties is taken direct to the revaluation reserve until the carrying amount reaches historical cost and, thereafter, to the extent that the value in use can be demonstrated to be higher than valuation.
Any other deficit arising is charged to the Profit and Loss Account.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2005 41 Notes to the Accounts at 30 September 2005 1 Accounting Policies continued It is the Groups policy to maintain the properties comprising the licensed estate in such a condition that the residual values of the properties, based on prices prevailing at the time of acquisition or subsequent revaluation, are at least equal to their book values.
Having regard to this, it is the opinion of the directors that depreciation of any such property as required by the Companies Act 1985 and generally accepted accounting practice would not be material.
An annual impairment review is carried out on such properties.
Short leasehold properties, defined as properties with 50 years or less of the lease remaining unexpired, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired lease term.
Depreciation is provided on other categories of tangible fixed assets over 3 to 50 years on a straight-line basis to residual value.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the Profit and Loss Account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Assets held for resale Assets held for resale are stated at the lower of cost incurred and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred on disposal.
Deferred taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date, with the following exceptions: Provision is made for gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets only where, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding commitment to dispose of the replacement assets with no likely subsequent rollover or available capital losses.
Provision is made for deferred tax on gains on revalued fixed assets only where there is a commitment to dispose of the revalued assets and the attributable gain can neither be rolled over or eliminated by capital losses.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Pensions The Group makes contributions to certain employees own pension plans in accordance with the terms of their contracts of employment.
The cost of these contributions is charged to the Profit and Loss Account as they are made.
42 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the Accounts at 30 September 2005 1 Accounting Policies continued A combined defined contribution and defined benefit scheme was acquired with Unique in 2004 which is now closed to new members.
This scheme is valued every three years using the projected unit method by qualified independent actuaries.
The cost of providing defined benefit pensions is charged to administrative expenses to reflect the current and past service cost, with the return on the pension scheme investments shown as other financial income or expenses.
Actuarial gains and losses are shown in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
This treatment represents full adoption of FRS 17.
Capital instruments The finance cost recognised in the Profit and Loss Account in respect of capital instruments other than equity shares is allocated to periods over the term of the instrument at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
2 Turnover Turnover represents the amounts derived from the provision of goods and services which fall within the Groups ordinary activity, stated net of value added tax and discounts.
Beer and cider sales and wines, spirits and minerals sales are recognised when these goods are delivered to our customers.
Rents receivable from the licensed estate are recognised in the accounting period to which the income relates.
The Group operates in one principal area of activity, that of a public house landlord.
This operation takes place solely in the United Kingdom.

WHL owns one hotel, The Westley Hotel, Acocks Green, Birmingham Westley.
The issued share capital of WHL is 20,000 ordinary shares of 1 each and Enterprise was the legal and beneficial owner of 50% of these shares, purchased at a cost of 10,000 in May 1997.
The remaining 50% of the ordinary shares were owned by the operator of the Westley, purchased at a cost of 10,000.
Enterprise earned 50% of the profits of WHL during the 8 year period of ownership and this amounted to 225,000 at the date of sale.
This amount earned had been accrued in the accounts but no cash distribution had been made by WHL.
The shares were sold in April 2005 due to the retirement of the operator of the hotel.
The shares were acquired by Simply Inns Limited for a total cash consideration of 980,000, with 490,000 paid to Enterprise and 490,000 paid to the other shareholder.
Enterprise realised a profit on disposal of 255,000, before costs of 15,000.
The sale followed a thorough marketing exercise and competitive sale tendering process conducted on behalf of the owners by Humberts Leisure Limited.
At the date of sale, David George, Finance Director, and his immediate family owned 19.7% of the ordinary shares and 100% of the preference shares of Simply Inns Limited.
