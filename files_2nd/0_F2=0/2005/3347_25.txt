Notes to the financial statements of the Company For the year ended 31 December 2005 1 Basis of preparation The financial information in this report for the Company has been prepared on the basis of accounting policies set out in note 2 using accounting principles generally accepted in the UK UK GAAP and the Companies Act 1985.
2 Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented except in relation to share-based payments as noted below.
The Company has adopted FRS 17 Retirement benefits, FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date, the presentation elements of FRS 25 Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation, and FRS 28 Corresponding amounts.
The adoption of these standards has had no impact on either this years figures or the comparative figures.
The Company has also adopted FRS 20 Share-based payments during the year.
The effect of adopting FRS 20 was to increase operating costs by 1.6 million, increase creditors by 0.8 million and to credit 0.8 million to reserves in the balance sheet.
The charge in 2004 of 0.4 million was similar to that under the previous accounting policy but there is a reduction in liabilities of 0.4 million at 31 December 2004 because the credit entry is taken to equity under FRS 20 rather than being treated as a liability.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rate at the date of transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement.
Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are included at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided on the incremental liability approach in respect of timing differences giving rise to an asset or liability.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Share-based payments The Company operates equity-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the income statement.
The fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
This expense is spread over the vesting period of the instrument.
The corresponding entry is credited to equity.
The liability for social security costs arising in relation to the awards is re-measured at each reporting date based on the share price as at the reporting date and the elapsed portion of the relevant vesting periods to the extent it is considered probable that a liability will arise.

8 Contingent liabilities Charter, together with certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, has been named as defendant in a number of asbestos-related actions in the United States on the basis that it is allegedly liable for the acts of a former subsidiary Cape PLC.
Charter contests the existence of any such liability.
The issue went to trial in three cases involving the Companys principal subsidiary, Charter Consolidated P. L. C. and other wholly-owned subsidiaries, between 1985 and 1987.
In the first of these cases, tried in Pennsylvania, after an adverse lower court decision the appeal court gave judgement in the Charter defendants favour.
In the second case, in New Jersey, judgement was also given for the Charter defendants.
The third case, in South Carolina, was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, without a decision having been rendered on the issue.
During recent years, Charter and or certain of its subsidiaries have been served in a number of cases in Mississippi, Illinois and a few other states.
Currently the cases against Charter are confined to Mississippi.
Charter is seeking dismissals in these pending cases.
Upon advice of counsel, Charter has settled some of the cases brought in Mississippi and will continue to pursue dismissals in the remainder.
The Directors have received legal advice that Charter and its wholly-owned subsidiaries should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions brought against them, but that uncertainty must exist as to the eventual outcome of the trial of any particular action.
It is not practicable to estimate in any particular case the amount of damages which might ensue if liability were imposed on Charter or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
In 2005, 0.1 million was charged against Charters operating profits in respect of defence costs and other expenses.
The litigation is reviewed each year and, based on that review and legal advice, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any such liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charters financial position.
In these circumstances, the Directors have concluded that it is not appropriate to make any provision in respect of such actions.
