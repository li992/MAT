The Company supports these arrangements through the provision of guarantees, which at 31 December 2005 amounted to 19.6 million 2004 18.6 million.
The Group has written a number of guarantees in relation to third party funding arrangements with subsidiaries.
These guarantees can only be exercised by the lender in the event of predefined events all of which reflect financial risks.
Therefore these agreements are accounted for under IAS 37.
Guarantees are also provided by another Group company that totalled 11.3 million at 31 December 2005 2004 30.7 million.
Total loans outstanding through these financing arrangements at 31 December 2005 were 205.6 million 2004 205.8 million.
On 31 December 2005 the total extent of these guarantees amounted to 30.9 million 2004 49.3 million.
In the last five years the Group has not suffered any loss in relation to these schemes.
49 POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS On 17 February 2006 the Group announced that it had reached an agreement to enter the Russian pharmaceutical wholesale market through the acquisition of a 96% controlling stake in A. P. Apteka Holding Limited, the parent company of Apteka Holding ZAO, for a consideration of approximately 18 million.
In addition the Group will assume approximately 10 million of net debt.
The Group will have an option to acquire the remaining 4% of A. P. Apteka Holding Limited within three to six years.
The transaction, which is conditional upon receiving regulatory approval, is expected to be completed by the end of March 2006.
50 TRANSITION TO IFRS All references to UK GAAP in this note are to UK GAAP applicable for the year ended 31 December 2004.
This is the first year that the Group has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 December 2004 and the date of transition to IFRS was 1 January 2004.
On 18 July 2005, the Group published detailed income statement and balance sheet reconciliations of UK GAAP to IFRS.
The following is an abridged extract of the published document describing the effects of adoption of IFRS and the reconciliations required in the year of transition.
Summary of the effects of IFRS adoption The principal impacts of IFRS on the Groups 2004 financial statements were as follows: recognition of a charge for the fair value of share-based compensation: requirement not to amortise goodwill: recognition of deferred taxation liabilities on pharmacy licences, unremitted earnings of associates and rolled over capital gains: and recognition of dividends only when they are declared rather than when proposed.
In terms of the 2004 results, reported profits increased under IFRS, mainly because of the reversal of goodwill amortisation and the reversal of goodwill recycled from reserves on the disposal of subsidiaries.
Impact on profit Excluding goodwill amortisation, the profit on disposal of subsidiaries and amounts written off investments, the effect of adoption of IFRS was not significant.
The Group considers the measurement of profit excluding these items to be a useful indication of underlying performance.
The reduction in profits as a result of the requirement to recognise a charge for the fair value of share-based compensation awards was largely offset by the net credit arising from the movements in deferred taxation liabilities recognised on unremitted earnings of associates, pharmacy licences and rolled over capital gains.
Impact on net assets Net assets at 31 December 2004 decreased under IFRS.
This was predominantly due to the recognition of additional deferred taxation liabilities under IFRS as a general principle, the recognition of deferred taxation liabilities is more comprehensive under IFRS than UK GAAP.
Partially offsetting this reduction in net assets was the reversal of the 2004 goodwill amortisation charge and the accrual for the proposed 2004 final dividend.
109 Alliance UniChem Plc 50 TRANSITION TO IFRS CONTINUED Explanation of adjustments to conform to IFRS The significant changes as a result of the transition to IFRS and of adopting the IFRS Group accounting policies are described below: Share-based compensation Principal difference Under UK GAAP, a charge to the profit and loss account was made in respect of share-based compensation schemes based on the intrinsic value of the awards.
Under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, a charge to income, representing the fair value of outstanding equity instruments granted to employees under share-based compensation schemes, is recognised over the vesting period of the schemes.
Impact The Groups principal share based compensation schemes comprise savings related and discretionary share option schemes.
Under UK GAAP, there was no charge for these share-based compensation schemes because they are either Inland Revenue approved and therefore specifically excluded from the requirement to record a charge or have an intrinsic value of nil as the option price is set at the market value at the date of grant.
The Group has taken up the option under IFRS 1 permitting companies to apply IFRS 2 only to equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 January 2005.
As a result, the share-based compensation charge in respect of equity settled compensation was 2.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Goodwill amortisation business combinations Principal difference Under UK GAAP, goodwill was amortised over its expected useful economic life, up to a maximum of 20 years.
Under IFRS 3 Business Combinations goodwill is not amortised.
Under both UK GAAP and IFRS, the carrying value of goodwill is tested for impairment and provided for as necessary.
The Group has carried out impairment tests and no adjustment was deemed necessary.
IFRS does not allow the recycling of goodwill to the income statement which was previously written off against reserves.
The Group has taken up the option under IFRS 1 permitting companies not to restate past business combinations prior to the opening balance sheet date 1 January 2004.
Impact Goodwill amortisation under UK GAAP of 15.1 million, comprising 10.0 million in respect of subsidiary undertakings and 5.1 million in respect of associates, was added back to the profit for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The exceptional item under UK GAAP in the second half of 2004 relating to the profit on disposal of businesses included 11.1 million of capitalised goodwill and 6.5 million of goodwill originally written off directly to reserves and recycled to the profit and loss account as part of the calculation of the profit on disposal.
Under IFRS, the profit on disposal was increased by a net amount of 5.6 million, being a reduction of the 2004 amortisation charge of 0.9 million deducted from the capitalised goodwill disposed of, and an increase due to the reversal of the amount of 6.5 million of goodwill recycled from reserves.
Deferred taxation Principal difference Under UK GAAP, deferred taxation was provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation was provided on remittable earnings of associates only where there is a commitment to remit the earnings.
Deferred taxation was not provided on timing differences arising from either rolled over gains or the revaluation of fixed assets where there was no commitment to sell the asset.
Under IFRS, specifically IAS 12 Income Taxes, deferred taxation is provided in full on all taxable temporary differences.
Consequently, IFRS is generally more comprehensive in the requirement to recognise deferred taxation.
For example, deferred taxation is provided on the revaluation of fixed assets and rolled over capital gains regardless of whether there is a commitment to sell the asset.
Deferred taxation is provided on remittable earnings of associates where incremental tax would be due, regardless of whether there is a commitment to remit the earnings.
Deferred taxation is also provided when retail pharmacy licences are acquired through the purchase of shares, regardless of whether there is an intention to sell the licences or not.
Impact The most significant impact was on the opening balance sheet where there was a reduction in net assets of 90.3 million as a result of recognising additional deferred taxation liabilities.
The largest item was 67.3 million in respect of deferred taxation liabilities on pharmacy licences, which arose as a consequence of our decision to take up the exemption not to revisit acquisition accounting prior to the IFRS transition date.
Taking up the exemption meant that we were required to recognise this liability as a reduction to equity in the opening IFRS balance sheet, and as such it was a one off effect.
Going forward, recognition of this type of deferred taxation liability results in an increase in capitalised goodwill.
Changes in taxation rates and indexation when applied to these additional deferred taxation liabilities impact profits under IFRS when compared to UK GAAP.
The net impact of deferred taxation on the results of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2004 was an increase in profits of 1.5 million.
The following section describes in more detail the impact of the more significant additional deferred taxation liabilities recognised under IFRS.
110 Alliance UniChem Plc Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 50 TRANSITION TO IFRS CONTINUED Explanation of adjustments to conform to IFRS continued Deferred taxation continued Impact continued Remittable earnings of associates: A deferred taxation charge of 2.6 million arising on remittable earnings of associates was recognised in the year ended 31 December 2004 under IFRS.
At 31 December 2004 the cumulative deferred taxation liability on all such remittable earnings was 7.4 million and at 1 January 2004 was 4.8 million.
Pharmacy licences: When retail pharmacies are acquired through the purchase of shares as opposed to asset deals, the Group acquires an asset the licence with a tax base cost significantly lower than the book value and so a temporary difference arises.
The deferred taxation on this difference is recognised under IFRS.
Under UK GAAP, deferred taxation was provided on timing differences and initial recognition of pharmacy licences as a fair value adjustment does not create a timing difference.
As noted, the Group chose not to restate business combinations prior to the IFRS transition date 1 January 2004.
A consequence of this was that under the transitional requirements of IFRS 1, the deferred taxation liability on retail pharmacy licences required to be recognised under IFRS was adjusted through retained earnings rather than capitalised goodwill.
For the Group, the effect of this requirement was to reduce total equity under IFRS at 1 January 2004 by 67.3 million, being the deferred taxation liability in relation to retail licences purchased under share deals up to 1 January 2004.
The taxation will not be payable as long as the licences are not sold.
From 1 January 2004, the deferred taxation liability has been recognised on acquisitions with a corresponding increase in capitalised goodwill, and as such there is no effect on total equity.
As a result of a reduction in the tax rate in The Netherlands in the second half of 2004 and indexation in the UK during 2004, the deferred taxation liability reduced and a deferred taxation credit of 2.6 million was recognised as an adjustment to the profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 under IFRS.
After this credit, the effect at 31 December 2004 was to reduce total equity under IFRS by 64.7 million.
Rolled over capital gains: The requirement to recognise a deferred tax liability on rolled over capital gains regardless of whether there was a commitment to sell the asset resulted in a decrease in total equity at the opening balance sheet date of 14.4 million.
A deferred taxation credit of 1.0 million was recognised in the second half of the year ended 31 December 2004 as a result of a decrease in the French capital gains tax rate from 2005, applied to the rolled over capital gains relating to fixed asset investments held in France.
This brought the total deferred taxation liability on rolled over gains at 31 December 2004 to 13.4 million.
Fixed asset revaluations: The requirement to recognise a deferred tax liability on fixed asset revaluations regardless of whether there was a commitment to sell the asset resulted in a decrease in total equity at the opening balance sheet of 5.1 million.
A deferred taxation credit of 0.5 million was recognised in the second half of the year as a result of the disposal of certain fixed assets.
This brought the total deferred taxation liability on fixed asset revaluations at 31 December 2004 to 4.6 million.
Share-based compensation charge: A deferred taxation asset is recognised under IFRS in respect of share-based compensation.
The asset is calculated on the difference between the market price of the Companys shares at the balance sheet date and the option price for options granted to UK employees and results in an increase in total equity at the opening balance sheet date of 0.2 million.
On re-measurement of the deferred taxation asset, an element of this is taken to the income statement under IFRS, which amounts to a 0.5 million deferred taxation credit in the year ended 31 December 2004, and the remainder is taken directly to reserves.
As at 31 December 2004 the cumulative deferred taxation asset on all such options was 1.2 million.
Dividends Principal difference Under UK GAAP, dividends proposed were provided for in the period to which they related.
Under IFRS, dividends are only provided for when the dividend has been declared.
Impact The requirement to provide for dividends only when they are declared resulted in an increase in total equity of 38.1 million at the opening balance sheet date and an increase of 43.5 million at 31 December 2004.
Consolidation of special purpose entities Principal difference The Group runs securitisation programmes in the UK, France and Italy whereby it sells certain trade receivables and receives an initial cash payment on a non-recourse basis in return.
The securitised receivables are purchased by special purpose entities which under UK GAAP were not consolidated.
Under SIC-12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities, special purpose entities shall be consolidated when the substance of the relationship with the reporting entity indicates that the special purpose entities are controlled by the reporting entity.
The substance of the relationship with the special purpose entities in the UK and in Italy requires those entities to be consolidated.
On the basis that the Group does not meet the control indicators set out in SIC-12 there is no requirement to consolidate the French special purpose entity.
Impact The consolidation of the UK and Italian special purpose entities had the effect of eliminating from operating expenses fixed charges of 0.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2004 and increasing finance costs by 0.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2004.
There was no impact on profits resulting from this change, which is merely a reclassification within the financial statements.
111 Alliance UniChem Plc 50 TRANSITION TO IFRS CONTINUED Explanation of adjustments to conform to IFRS continued Computer software Principal difference Under UK GAAP, the Groups capitalised computer software was included within tangible fixed assets, whereas under IFRS it is classified as an intangible asset.
Impact At the opening balance sheet date, computer software with a net book value of 14.7 million was reclassified from tangible fixed assets to intangible assets.
At 31 December 2004 the net book value reclassified was 23.9 million.
Depreciation amounting to 5.0 million was reclassified as amortisation under IFRS in the year ended 31 December 2004.
Other reclassifications Principal differences The other significant reclassifications for the Group under IFRS compared to UK GAAP were as follows: items that were treated as non-operating exceptional items under UK GAAP and relate to continuing operations are included in arriving at profit from operations: and the Groups share of the results of associates are now shown on a single line in the income statement.
Adoption of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement The Group has chosen not to restate comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39, and is applying these standards with effect from 1 January 2005.
As a result, the relevant 2004 comparative information does not reflect the impact of these standards and is accounted for and presented on a UK GAAP basis.
Set out below are the significant areas where the Group was affected from 1 January 2005, which are predominantly around the presentation of the balance sheet.
Securitised receivables Principal difference Under UK GAAP linked presentation was used by the Group to record receivables sold and non-recourse receipts received in respect of securitisation programmes in the UK, France and Italy.
Under IAS 32 and IAS 39, linked presentation is no longer permitted and the non-recourse receipts are to be reported separately within liabilities.
As a result of the Groups decision not to restate comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39, the non-recourse receipts in the balance sheet presented in the comparative information are presented under the UK GAAP basis of linked presentation.
Impact Liabilities will include amounts relating to non-recourse receipts received in respect of securitisation programmes.
Based on the position at 31 December 2004, this amounted to 400.8 million in the 2005 opening balance sheet.
There is no impact on reserves resulting from these changes, which are merely reclassifications within the balance sheet.
Derivative instruments and hedging activities Principal difference Under IAS 32 and IAS 39, all derivative instruments are recognised in the balance sheet as financial assets or financial liabilities and are recorded at their fair value.
The change in the fair value of a derivative instrument is taken immediately to the income statement where, provided fair value hedge accounting can be applied, it will be offset by a change in the fair value of the related hedged item.
If the derivative is hedging the variability of future cash flows in a cash flow hedge which meet the hedging criteria, the change in the fair value of the derivative is taken directly to reserves and is subsequently recycled to the income statement when the hedged cash flow impacts profit and loss.
The ineffective portions are taken immediately to the income statement.
The Group uses a mixture of debt and derivative financial instruments to hedge its non-sterling investments.
The effective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is taken to reserves and is subsequently recycled to the income statement when the Groups investment is disposed of.
The ineffective portion is taken immediately to the income statement.
Impact The effective date of adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 for the Group is 1 January 2005.
Excluding the impact of the grossing up of the securitised receivables as discussed above, the financial liabilities in the opening balance sheet in 2005 increased by 22.3 million, offset by related deferred taxation of 6.7 million, giving a net reduction to total equity of 15.6 million.
Available-for-sale financial assets Principal difference Under UK GAAP, listed investments are recorded on the balance sheet at the lower of cost and realisable value.
Under IAS 32 and IAS 39, the Groups listed investments are categorised as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.
Changes in fair value, together with any related deferred taxation, are taken directly to reserves and are recycled to the income statement when the investment is sold or is determined to be impaired.
The financial assets in the opening balance sheet in 2005 increased by 3.9 million due to the recognition of listed investments at fair value, which together with the related deferred taxation liability of 0.4 million gave a net increase to total equity of 3.5 million.

The material adjustments caused by the transition to IFRS on the cash flow statement for that year were as follows: 1.
Tax paid is classified as an operating cash flow under IFRS, whereas under UK GAAP this was shown as a separate category of cash flow.
Interest paid is classified as an operating cash flow under IFRS, whereas under UK GAAP this was shown within the returns on investments category.
Dividends received from associates are classified within investing activities under IFRS, whereas under UK GAAP this was shown as a separate category of cash flow.
Cash flows arising from acquisitions and disposals are classified within investing activities under IFRS, whereas under UK GAAP these were shown as a separate category of cash flow.
Cash flows arising from capital expenditure and financial investment are classified within investing activities under IFRS, whereas under UK GAAP these were shown as a separate category of cash flow.
Dividends paid to equity shareholders are classified within financing activities under IFRS, whereas under UK GAAP these were shown as a separate category of cash flow.
The definition of cash and cash equivalents under IFRS includes money market borrowings maturing within one week.
Beneath the IFRS cash flow statement a reconciliation of the increase in cash and cash equivalents to net borrowings is provided.
Under IFRS, net borrowings are defined by the Group as borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments.
This definition is consistent with the definition of net borrowings under UK GAAP.
The only significant difference between the net borrowings amount at 31 December 2004 between IFRS and UK GAAP is in respect of the land element of certain leases for land and buildings.
Under UK GAAP these were treated wholly as finance leases, whilst under IFRS it is necessary to split out the land from the building element and consider these separately.
In some instances, under IFRS the land element no longer met the definition of a finance lease and is accounted for as an operating lease.
The effect of this different treatment is to decrease net borrowings under IFRS by 4.2 million at 31 December 2004.
The total decrease in net borrowings under IFRS at 31 December 2004 was 5.2 million.
