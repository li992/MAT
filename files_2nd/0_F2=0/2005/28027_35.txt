Risk management, financial assets and liabilities Risk management The holding of securities, investing activities and associated financing undertaken pursuant to the investment policy involves certain inherent risks.
Events may occur that would result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of revenue returns.
Set out below are the principal risks inherent in the Companys activities and the actions taken to manage these risks.
The main risk arising from the Companys financial instruments, which includes investments, is market price risk incorporating interest rate risk.
It should be noted that the prices of warrants, options and geared equity-related derivative instruments tend to be more volatile than the prices of the underlying securities.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these are summarised below.
These policies have remained substantially unchanged for the two years ended 31 March 2005.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and movements in exchange rates.
This risk is monitored by the Board on a quarterly basis and on a daily basis by the Manager.
Interest rate risk is limited by the Companys financial structure with operations mainly financed through shareholders funds.
Additional financing has been provided during the year in the form of an uncommitted sterling bank overdraft facility of 50 million, which is repayable on demand, and a 30,000,000 6.125% Debenture 2014.
The fixed rate of 6.125% per annum of the debenture has been swapped into a variable rate of six months LIBOR 0.95% until 8 July 2005.
Liquidity risk and cash flow risk are minimised as the majority of the Companys assets comprise readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments as necessary.
Foreign currency risk The income and capital value of the Companys investments and liabilities can be affected by exchange rate movements as some of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than Sterling which is the Companys reporting currency.
The key areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company are: movement in rates affect the value of investments and liabilities: movements in rates affect the income received: and movements in rates affect short-term timing differences.

Financial assets and liabilities The Companys assets and liabilities, excluding short-term debtors and creditors, but including short-term loans, comprise financial instruments which include: investments principally comprising equity shares, which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date, together with a relatively small proportion of fixed interest securities see list of investments on pages 9 and 10.
