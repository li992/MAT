This is the first full year of electricity consumption for two new sites opened in 2003 in addition to which we have opened a number of new stores.
In the past year, Burberry has increased its warehouse capacity to match the growing demand from our customers.
This has given us the opportunity to take a number of energy efficiency measures, such as the inclusion of motion sensing lights in the warehouse aisles.
We have subjected our recently acquired factory in Rotherham to an energy review and will be considering some of the recommendations for improved efficiency.
We are particularly pleased with the progress of the retail stores under our direct control as they achieved energy savings of 14.7% during the year.
Materials and waste Burberry in both the UK and Spain reports on its use of packaging under the Producer Responsibility Obligations.
We are proactively working to reduce this impact and during the year a number of new initiatives were introduced.
We now reuse inbound cartons from suppliers for shipping orders to our retail warehouse and distribution from this warehouse to the UK retail stores is now performed using reusable tote boxes.
Two of our wholesale sites are trialling the use of cardboard balers in order to aid the treatment and collection of this material.

This results in significant cost and environmental savings.
Although this move to slower distribution methods is set against a just in time industry background: our careful planning and customer education work has allowed this change to be made without adversely affecting the performance of the business.
This year we diverted a further 29 tonnes of product away from air freight making a total of 183 tonnes of product shipped by sea.
The saving of carbon dioxide remained unchanged from last year: some 650 tonnes, as many of these products were shipped shorter distances than in the previous year.
In the current financial year we expect both of these indicators to improve as we continue to extend the range of locations that we ship to.
We have also reduced unnecessary shipping to our principal UK warehouse by increasing the proportion of product shipped directly from our suppliers to our globally dispersed storage facilities.
Over the next year we are aiming to further increase the proportion of product shipped directly from the supplier and further encourage the use of sea freight over air freight.
