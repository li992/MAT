Notes to the consolidated financial statements 29 Share based payment Rexams equity settled share based payment schemes comprise the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS, the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and the Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE.
Rexams cash settled share based payment scheme is the Phantom Stock Plan Phantoms.
LTIS Annual grants of options over ordinary shares are made to executive directors and certain senior executives.
The Total Shareholder Return TSR of Rexam is measured and compared to a comparator group of listed companies.
The percentage of share options that actually vest is dependent upon Rexams comparative TSR over a three year measurement period, commencing on 1 January of the year in which the option is granted.
Share options vest on 1 January, three years after the start of the measurement period and can be exercised at a nominal cost to the employee.
The expiry date is six years and eleven months after the grant date.
ESOS Annual grants of options over ordinary shares are made to certain executives.
All shares will vest if the performance target annual growth rate of economic profit of 4% per annum is met over the three year measurement period.
Share options are exercisable three years after grant date and expire ten years after grant date.
The exercise price is set at market value using the average of the mid market price of a Rexam ordinary share over a three day period preceding the grant date.
SAYE All employee SAYE schemes are open to eligible employees resident in the UK and Ireland.
Annual grants of options over ordinary shares are currently made at an exercise price of 80% of the market value of Rexam shares at grant date.
Share options vest three, five or seven years after grant date, depending on the scheme selected by the employee at grant and expire six months after vesting.
Phantoms This scheme operates in the same way as the ESOS with the same terms and conditions, but is made to certain executives located outside the UK and is settled in cash.
The employee bene t expense recognised in relation to share based payment is set out below.

Historical volatilities are arrived at using a period comparable with the expected life of the option.
The correlation coef cient for the LTIS is calculated using the correlation matrix for the TSR simulation using three year daily historical stock price series for each company in the comparator group, including Rexam, from the beginning of the measurement date.
A ten year life is initially assumed to calculate the fair value of phantoms.
As the fair value is updated at each subsequent valuation the expected life is reduced for each year until exercise.
