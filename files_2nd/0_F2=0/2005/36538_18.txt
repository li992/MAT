Nevertheless, rental growth in prime shopping centres and retail parks remained good.

The combination of sustained demand and little additional supply led to a reduction in the overall market vacancy rate from 12% to 9% during 2005, mainly driven by a large fall in vacancy in the City of London.

The group issued its 2004 full year financial statements restated under IFRS on 26 April 2005, complete with reconciliations to, and explanations of the differences from, the gures as they were reported under UK GAAP.
The 2005 interim report, published in September, was also prepared under IFRS.
These reports are available on the Companys website, www.
Further details of the impacts of the change on reported pro ts and equity shareholders funds are provided in note 27 to the accounts in the 2005 Directors Report and Financial Statements.
The main changes to Hammersons financial statements have been the recognition of the revaluation changes of investment properties and certain derivatives in the income statement rather than the statement of recognised income and expense, and the inclusion in the balance sheet of the tax that may arise on the disposal of all properties in the portfolio.
The adoption of IFRS has changed the presentation and format of the financial statements.
However, it has no impact on the cash ows of the business or its underlying performance.
Results and Dividend In 2005 net rental income was 210.3 million, compared with 189.5 million in 2004.
The increase principally re ected the contribution from recently acquired properties, rent reviews at The Oracle Shopping Centre, indexation in France and the receipt of surrender premiums.
On a like-for-like basis, net rental income from the investment portfolio increased by 6.0%.
For the portfolio as a whole the year on year movements may be analysed as follows: 2005 2004 Net Rental Income Reconciliation m m Properties owned throughout 2005 and 2004 185.2 174.0 Acquisitions 20.7 3.2 Properties sold 1.2 12.5 Developments 3.2 0.3 Exchange translation and other 0.5 Net rental income 210.3 189.5 During the year, net rental income included 4.8 million related to retail tenants turnover and net income of 8.1 million from car parks at the groups shopping centres.
Rent receivable of 5.6 million has been accrued and allocated to rent free periods in 2005.
Administration expenses in 2005 rose by 4.8 million to 31.4 million, primarily due to increased staff costs and a reduction in asset management and development management fees receivable.
Provision for the performance related annual bonuses and the cost of other share-based remuneration, the latter also requiring performance criteria to have been met before vesting, totalled 4.4 million in 2005, compared with 3.8 million in 2004.
Net finance costs in 2005, excluding the change in fair value of interest rate swaps, increased by 9.8 million compared with 2004 as a result of increased borrowings drawn to fund acquisitions and the development programme, although the effect was partly offset by lower interest rates.
The average cost of borrowing for 2005 was 5.8% and interest cover was 1.9 times in both 2004 and 2005.
Pro t before tax was 698.6 million, compared with 413.4 million in 2004.
Adjusted pro t before tax, which excludes gains on investment properties and certain other items, rose by 6.2 million in 2005 to 89.4 million.

The 2004 charge of 80.9 million included the one-off entry charge to the French SIIC regime.
The deferred tax charge in 2005 mainly re ected the increase in the value of the investment property portfolio.
27 FINANCIAL REVIEW CO NTINUED Results and Dividend continued Adjusted earnings per share in 2005 increased by 2.5 pence, or 8.7%, to 31.2 pence.
Full details of the calculations for earnings per share are provided in note 10 to the accounts in the 2005 Directors Report and Financial Statements.
The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 13.91 pence per share which, together with the interim dividend of 5.80 pence per share, makes a total of 19.71 pence per share for the year.
This represents an increase of 10.0% over the total dividend for 2004.
Cash Flow Cash ow from operating activities was 45 million in 2005, compared with 61 million in the previous year.
The decrease arose principally because the first annual interest payment on the 300 million sterling bond issued in February 2004 was made in February 2005.
This more than offset additional rent receipts during the year.
Disposals in 2005 raised 224 million, whilst property acquisitions and capital expenditure amounted to 538 million.
After the net cash in ow of 236 million from nancing activities, there was a net decrease in cash and short term deposits over the year of 8 million.
Balance Sheet Hammersons property portfolio was valued at 5,732 million at 31 December 2005, compared with 4,603 million at the end of 2004.
The revaluation surplus accounted for 773 million of the increase, with additions, including capitalised interest, accounting for a further 616 million.
These increases were partly offset by exchange translation losses of 41 million, the sale of properties with a book value of 193 million and transfers to owner occupied properties of 26 million.
At the year end, net asset value per share, calculated in line with the recommendations of EPRA, was 12.37, an increase of 292 pence per share or 30.9% during 2005.
The revaluation surplus contributed 271 pence to the increase, with the remainder primarily accounted for by retained pro ts.

With cash and deposits of 46 million, net debt amounted to 2,049 million.
The weighted average maturity of debt at 31 December 2005 was approximately nine years.
Unsecured borrowings represented 97% of total debt at the year end: secured debt of 70 million was principally in respect of the groups share of a borrowing facility nancing the Moorhouse joint venture.
Gearing was 66% compared with 72% at the end of 2004 and the loan to value ratio was 38%.
The balance sheet at 31 December 2005 included a deferred tax liability of 406 million.
If deferred tax is added back to equity shareholders funds, gearing would be 58%.
The market value of borrowings at the end of December 2005 was 2,301 million, some 207 million greater than the book value, equivalent, after tax relief, to a reduction in net asset value of 51 pence per share.
Undrawn committed facilities at the year end were 283 million which, when added to cash and deposits, provided liquidity of 329 million.
In May 2005, Hammerson signed a 370 million five year syndicated revolving credit facility.
Since the year end, the Company has issued 300 million unsecured bonds at a coupon of 5.25%, redeemable in December 2016.

Returns The table below presents information on the returns which the group has achieved during 2005, including the returns from joint ventures, and compares them with benchmark indices where appropriate.
Portfolio capital return 17.6% IPD All property benchmark 13.3% Portfolio income return 4.2% IPD All pr operty benchmark 5.4% Portfolio total return 22.5% IPD All property benchmark 19.4% Return on shareholders equity 34.0% Estimated cost of equity 7.3% Total shareholder return 20.1% FTSE 350 real estate index 20.3% The IPD All property benchmark includes retail, of ce and industrial property returns for United Kingdom property.
Hammerson does not invest in industrial property, which had the lowest sector returns in 2005.
The principal reasons why Hammerson outperformed the IPD benchmark for capital returns were the valuation increases on developments and the valuation growth in the French portfolio.
Income returns were lower than the benchmark as the group invests in prime shopping centres and of ces, which attract low yields.
Hammersons return on shareholders equity for the year ended 31 December 2005 was 34.0%, which compares with the groups estimated cost of equity of 7.3%.
The majority of the return on shareholders equity for 2005 resulted from property revaluation gains.
Total shareholder return, comprising increases in the share price and dividends, was 20.1%, marginally below the total return on the FTSE 350 real estate index.
Over the last three years, Hammersons total shareholder return was 135.3%, some ten percentage points above the real estate index.

By Order of the Board Stuart Haydon Secretary 10 March 2006 SUMMARY REMUNERATION REPORT The Remuneration Committee The Committee currently comprises John Barton Chairman, John Clare and Tony Watson, who was appointed on 1 February 2006.
The Committee meets to consider, for recommendation to the Board, Company policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors and to approve the composition and level of remuneration of Executive Directors and certain senior executives.
The Board has accepted, without amendment, the Committees recommendations relating to remuneration policy.
In determining an appropriate remuneration policy for recommendation to the Board, the Committees objective is to ensure that the Company continues to attract, retain and motivate experienced individuals, capable of making a major contribution to Hammersons success.
Remuneration for Executive Directors and senior executives takes account of performance through an annual performance related bonus scheme and, for long term performance, by the award of shares under the Companys Deferred Share Plan.
To assist the Committee in determining remuneration policy, the Committee has received advice from Hay Group who have been appointed by the Committee and who provide no other services to the Company.
In addition, although they are not members of the Committee, information and advice has been provided and recommendations have been made by Ronald Spinney until his retirement as Chairman on 30 September 2005, John Nelson newly appointed Chairman, John Richards Chief Executive other than in respect of his own position and by the groups Director of Human Resources.
In implementing the policy, following its approval by the Board, the Committee takes into account remuneration packages available within other comparable companies, the Companys overall performance, achievement of corporate objectives, individual performance and published views of investors and their representatives.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for performance related bonuses or grants of options and their fees are not pensionable.
The Long Term Incentive Plan target was last revised for grants made in 2003 and thereafter.
