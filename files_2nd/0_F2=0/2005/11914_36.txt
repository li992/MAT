In accordance with IFRS 3, goodwill is no longer amortised but rather tested for impairment on an annual basis.
Goodwill has been allocated for impairment purposes to twelve cash generating units.
The recoverable amount of each cash generating unit is based on value in use calculations, with the exception of IDC which is assessed on a market value basis.
The value in use calculations use cash ow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
The key assumptions used by management in the value in use calculations were: Discount rate The discount rate is based on the risk-free rate for government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reect the increased risk in investing in equities.
The risk premium adjustment is assessed for each specic cash generating unit.
The average pre-tax discount rates used are in the range of 8.5% to 11.5% for the Pearson Education businesses, 8% to 13% for the Penguin businesses and 8.5% to 11.5% for the FT Publishing businesses.
Perpetuity growth rates The cash ows subsequent to the approval budget period are based upon the long-term historic growth rates of the underlying territories in which the cash generating unit operates and reect the long-term growth prospects of the sectors in which the cash generating unit operates.
The perpetuity growth rates used vary between 3.0% to 4.0%.
The perpetuity growth rates are consistent with appropriate external sources for the relevant markets.
Cash ow growth rates The cash ow growth rates are derived from forecast sales growth taking into consideration past experience of operating margins achieved in the cash generating unit.
Historically, such forecasts have been reasonably accurate.
The valuation of IDC is determined using an observable market price for each share.
Other than goodwill there are no intangible assets with indefinite lives.
