38 PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS The pension costs included within the financial statements are prepared in accordance with SSAP 24 and this will continue until FRS 17 is fully implemented to replace SSAP 24.
In the transitional period, FRS 17 requires companies to provide additional disclosures in respect of defined benefit arrangements.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes and similar obligations throughout the world.
Approximately 75 per cent of Group employees participate in defined contribution or government schemes, ten per cent are members of defined benefit schemes principally in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand and the remaining 15 per cent are members of the UK based Pilkington Superannuation Scheme.
47 Outside the UK, pensions provided by defined benefit schemes are based on employees years of service and average final remuneration.
Where the schemes are funded in advance, the assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
This does not apply in Germany or Austria where there are no separate pension assets, but provisions for the pension liability are held in those Pilkington subsidiaries accounts.
In addition to the pension arrangements referred to above, there are the following arrangements: Post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits, principally in respect of employees, retirees and their dependants in the USA, details of which are referred to in note 26 a.
The Pilkington unfunded top-up arrangement for directors and certain senior executives is an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit arrangement providing defined benefits to members, whose earnings exceed the Inland Revenues cap on pensionable salary.
The Group charges the cost of the arrangement annually to the profit and loss account, as advised by the UK actuary, and holds these amounts as a provision in the balance sheet within pension provisions note 26 b. Statutory leaving service indemnity provisions are provided in respect of employees in certain European countries.
These are charged to the profit and loss account each year based on the service and salary of each employee and the provision is carried within other provisions note 26 e. a SSAP 24 pension costs The total pension cost for the Group is as follows: Defined benefit Defined contribution 2005 2004 2005 2004 m m m m Europe 12 11 27 27 North America 1 2 5 6 Rest of the world 1 1 3 4 12 10 35 37 The pension cost in respect of the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme in the UK amounted to 7 million 2004 7 million.
Independent actuarial valuations are undertaken at least triennially on varying dates for the Groups main defined benefit pension arrangements.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations of the Groups plans vary according to the economic conditions of the country in which they are situated.
The actuarial valuations, based on the projected unit method, assume, on a weighted average basis, that the investment return will exceed the increase in the future earnings by 4.3 per cent 2004 3.7 per cent.
The actuarial value of the fund assets of these plans was sufficient to cover 84 per cent 2004 88 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members.
This deficit includes a 3 million deficit on the unfunded German pension arrangements, which is being charged over the remaining service lives of the German employees at 1 million per annum.
In Germany, the annual charge to the profit and loss account amounted to 7 million 2004 9 million.
The charge is based on an assumed six per cent investment return, which is fixed by law but salary and pension increase assumptions are not permitted.
In addition, there is a deficit of 60 million on the US pension schemes, which will result in additional charges to the profit and loss account in future years.
The market value of the assets of the Groups principal defined benefit plans at the date of the latest valuations was 298 million 2004 313 million.
Total accrued pension costs amounted to 2 million 2004 3 million and are included in other creditors note 22.
Provision for the benefit obligation of the unfunded plans referred to above amounted to 137 million 2004 139 million and are included in provisions note 26 b. b FRS 17 retirement benefits Whilst the SSAP 24 disclosure and measurement principles have been applied by the Group in accounting for pensions and post-retirement benefits, FRS 17 on retirement benefits requires additional balance sheet and profit and loss account disclosures, as set out on the following pages.
PILKINGTON plc DIRECTORS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 NOTES ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 38 PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED Group The disclosures set out below are divided between pensions, which cover the Groups defined benefit schemes and the statutory leaving service indemnity arrangements, and the Groups post-retirement healthcare arrangements.
For the disclosures made in respect of defined benefit pension schemes and the statutory leaving service indemnity arrangements, a further division has been made between these schemes and arrangements which are funded and those which are unfunded.
These disclosures match the Groups segmental disclosures between Europe, North America and the rest of the world.
All schemes and arrangements within North America and the rest of the world are funded, whereas some within Europe are funded and others are unfunded arrangements.
48 There are 2,891 employees in the UK and 12,208 pensioners who are members of the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme.
Benefits payable are determined by reference to final salary.
However, under the trust deed governing the scheme, employers contributions are fixed at 10.5 per cent of pensionable salary for active members.
Under the deed the Group has no right of access to any investment surpluses but equally cannot be required to increase contributions to finance any deficits other than as may be required by legislation.
For this reason, the trustees follow a prudent policy of management and the scheme is funded at over 1.5 times the current minimum level at which additional funding would be required by legislation.
For this reason also, under SSAP 24, the scheme has historically been considered to be in the nature of a defined contribution scheme.
FRS 17 introduced new definitions for defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes but, unlike SSAP 24, it does not refer specifically to schemes such as the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme with features of both.
The disclosures required by FRS 17 for defined benefit schemes are given below in respect of the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme but, as the Group has no right of access to the economic benefits relating to any surplus in the scheme, any resulting asset is not recognised.
Any deficit would only be recognised to the extent that Pilkington had a legal or a constructive obligation to meet the deficit.
Defined benefit pension schemes The FRS 17 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuations as noted below updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31st March 2005.
The assets of the schemes are stated at their market values at 31st March 2005.

The defined benefit schemes are closed with the exception of the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme, the UK unfunded top-up scheme, the Canadian retirement plan for salaried employees, and the Pilkington Australia superannuation scheme.
The German defined benefit pension scheme is closed to new members but continuing employees accrue pension rights covering their current employment.
In the schemes which are now closed to new members, the age profile of the membership is rising and therefore under, the projected unit method, the current service cost will increase as members of the schemes approach retirement.

1,141 million represents the present value of the liabilities of the scheme as at the reporting date, and excludes discretionary benefit increases.
This reflects the nature of the scheme, whereby the employers contributions are fixed at 10.5 per cent of pensionable salary for active members and, under the trust deed, the employer cannot be required to fund any deficit, other than in accordance with legislation.

Furthermore a deficit would only be recognised in the balance sheet if the assets of the scheme were not sufficient to cover the legally required minimum benefits.
Therefore, the experience gains and losses are adjusted so that the net STRGL charge is nil.
This nil STRGL charge is a consequence of the recognised balance sheet item remaining at zero over the year and the disclosed profit and loss account charge being equal to the contributions paid.
The experience gain based on the actual movement of the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme reflecting the real experience of the scheme would be 2 million.

The cost of the contributions to the PSS by the company amount to 1 million 2004 1 million being 10.5 per cent of pensionable salaries.
At 31st March 2005 the surplus on the PSS, using appropriate FRS 17 assumptions, amounted to nil 2004 nil.
As the company does not have access to a share of the economic benefits of any surplus, none is recognised.
The cost of contributions to the unfunded top-up scheme for directors and certain senior executives amounted to nil 2004 1 million.
