W. NON-STATUTORY ACCOUNTS The accompanying financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 240 of the Companies Act 1985.
The Companys statutory accounts for fiscal 2005, that have been prepared in accordance International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and on which the Companys auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, have given an unqualified report that did not contain a statement under section 237 2 or 3 of the Companies Act 1985, will be filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales following the Companys Annual General Meeting on May 22, 2006.
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ADOPTED DURING THE YEAR SFAS 123R SHARE-BASED PAYMENT Share based compensation is provided to employees under the Companys share option, bonus and other share award plans, whereby the participating employees receive rights over shares in Tomkins plc.
In previous periods, the Company accounted for these plans in accordance with APB 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, which required that the compensation cost was measured on the basis of the intrinsic value of the awards at the grant date.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R Share-Based Payment which requires companies to measure the cost of share based compensation plans on the basis of the fair value of the awards.
Under SFAS 123R, the fair value of equity-settled awards is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
For cash-settled awards, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the liability is settled.
Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reflect actual and expected forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions.
The Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method with an effective date of January 2, 2005, whereby SFAS 123R has been applied prospectively to the unvested portion of awards that were outstanding as of January 1, 2005 and all awards granted, modified or settled on or after January 2, 2005.
The financial impact of adopting SFAS 123R is discussed in Note 18.

Under US GAAP, a discontinued operation is any component of an entity that has identifiable operations and cash flows and has been sold or is classified as held for sale at the balance sheet date.
Under IFRS, a discontinued operation is an operation that has been sold or is classified as held for sale at the balance sheet date, and itself represents, or its sale is part of a single plan to dispose of, a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.
Accordingly, more operations are likely to be classified as discontinued under US GAAP than under IFRS.
Under UK GAAP, the income and expenses of discontinued operations were included in the line item to which they related but their contribution to certain line items was disclosed either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements.
Sales and operating income information provided to the chief decision maker included the contribution of discontinued operations.
b Gain on disposal of continuing operations Under UK GAAP, gains on disposal of continuing operations were described as non-operating exceptional items and were shown separately within the income statement after operating income.
Under US GAAP and IFRS, there is no concept of a non-operating exceptional item and items that would have been classified as such under UK GAAP are included in operating income.
c Associates Under US GAAP, operating income does not include any amounts in respect of the Companys associates.
Under IFRS, operating income includes the Companys share of the net income of its associates.
Under UK GAAP, operating income included the Companys share of the income before taxes and non-operating exceptional items of its associates.
Under US GAAP, the Companys investments in associates accounted for using the equity method are included in operating assets but they are were not included under IFRS and UK GAAP.

SEGMENT INFORMATION CONTINUED I CLASSIFICATION DIFFERENCES CONTINUED d Investments Under US GAAP, available-for-sale investments are included in operating assets but they are were not included under IFRS and UK GAAP.
e Dividends on preferred shares Under US GAAP, accrued dividends on preferred shares are included in operating net assets.
Under IFRS, from January 2, 2005 onwards, accrued dividends on preferred shares are included in net debt and are therefore excluded from operating net assets.
Under UK GAAP, accrued dividends on preferred shares were not included in operating net assets.
II GOODWILL Under both US GAAP and IFRS, goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment.
However, a significant difference exists in the carrying value of goodwill due largely to historical differences in the initial measurement and subsequent accounting for goodwill arising on past acquisitions.
Under IFRS, the Company elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations to business combinations that occurred before January 4, 2004.
As a result, the Company recognized goodwill amounting to $387.9 million as at January 3, 2004, which represented the carrying value of goodwill recognized under UK GAAP on acquisitions completed on or after May 3, 1998.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions completed before May 3, 1998 amounting to $1,888.2 million was written off to reserves under UK GAAP and was not reinstated on adoption of IFRS.
Under US GAAP, the carrying value of goodwill as at January 3, 2004 was $1,706.7 million.
Under UK GAAP, capitalized goodwill was amortized over its estimated useful economic life, not exceeding 20 years, and was tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicated that it may have suffered an impairment loss.
III ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS Under both IFRS and US GAAP, intangible resources acquired in business combinations that occurred on or after January 4, 2004 are recognized as intangible assets if they are separable from the acquired business or arise from contractual or legal rights.
However, a significant difference exists in the carrying value of acquired intangible assets due largely to the differing treatment of intangible resources acquired in past acquisitions.
As a consequence of the decision not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations to business combinations that occurred before January 4, 2004, intangible resources acquired in those business combinations are not recognized as intangible assets under IFRS.
Under US GAAP, the carrying value of acquired intangible assets as at January 3, 2004 was $40.9 million.
Acquired intangible assets are amortized under both US GAAP and IFRS, but the amortization charge under IFRS is likely to be lower than under US GAAP due to the lower carrying amount of these assets under IFRS.
Under UK GAAP, intangible resources acquired in business combinations were recognized separately from goodwill only if they were separable from the acquired business and arose from contractual or legal rights.
The Company had not recognized any acquired intangible assets under UK GAAP.
IV PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS Under US GAAP, product development costs are charged to income in the period in which they are incurred.
Under IFRS, certain product development costs are capitalized when the conditions specified by IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met.
Capitalized development costs are amortized to the income statement over the expected life of the resulting product.
Under UK GAAP, product development costs were charged to income in the period in which they are incurred.
V RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES Under US GAAP, each component of a restructuring plan must be examined separately to determine when the related expenses may be recognized.
Involuntary employee termination costs may be recognized when management has committed to a detailed termination plan and has communicated the plan to employees.
Other restructuring expenses are generally recognized when they are incurred.
Under IFRS and UK GAAP, a restructuring plan is or was viewed as a whole and the related expenses are or were recognized when there exists an obligation to carry out the restructuring, which is generally when a detailed formal restructuring plan is announced.
VI CAPITALIZED INTEREST Under US GAAP, interest costs attributable to funding the construction of major items of property, plant and equipment are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset concerned.
Under IFRS and UK GAAP, the Company does or did not capitalize any element of its interest costs.
VII INVENTORY Under US GAAP, inventories are stated at the lower of cost and market value.
Cost is generally determined on a FIFO basis, but a last in, first out LIFO basis is used to determine the cost of inventory held by certain US subsidiaries.
Under IFRS and UK GAAP, use of the LIFO basis is or was prohibited.
VIII POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS Under US GAAP, IFRS and UK GAAP, the cost of defined benefit plans is or was calculated using the projected unit credit method and is or was recognized over the average expected remaining service lives of participating employees but there are or were significant differences with regard to the methods and assumptions that must be used for valuing plan assets and benefit obligations and for recognizing gains and losses.
Under US GAAP, the net periodic pension cost is charged wholly to operating income.
Under IFRS, the service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are included within operating income, but the interest cost is included in interest expense, the expected return on plan assets is included in interest income and actuarial gains and losses are recognized directly in equity.
Under both US GAAP and IFRS, the net benefit obligation is recognized as a liability but the amounts recognized differ, due largely to different methods of recognizing surpluses and deficits.
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005 GROUP US GAAP CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH US GAAP 149 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 7.
SEGMENT INFORMATION CONTINUED Under US GAAP, actuarial gains and losses are amortized over the remaining service lives of participating employees to the extent that, measured at the beginning of each fiscal year, they exceed 10 per cent of the greater of the market related value of the plan assets or the projected benefit obligation.
Under IFRS, actuarial gains and losses are recognized in equity in the period in which they occur.
Under IFRS, where a plan is in surplus the asset recognized is limited to the amount of any unrecognized past service costs and the present value of any amount which the Company expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
Under US GAAP, there is no restriction on the asset recognized in respect of a plan in surplus.
Under US GAAP, a minimum pension liability must be recognized that represents the amount by which the accumulated benefit obligation ignoring projected future salary increases exceeds the fair value of the plan assets.
A corresponding amount is recognized as an intangible asset, to the extent of any unrecognized prior service cost and any recognized transition obligation, and the balance is recognized in comprehensive income.
Under IFRS, there is no equivalent requirement to recognize a minimum pension liability because the net liability is fully recognized on the balance sheet.
Under UK GAAP, the net periodic pension cost was charged wholly to operating income and consisted of the regular cost and variations from the regular cost arising from actuarial gains and losses and retroactive changes in benefits that were aggregated and amortized over the expected remaining service lives of the active participants in the plan.
Gains and losses on settlements and curtailments were generally recognized in the period in which they occurred and if they related to the disposal or exit of businesses were included in non-operating exceptional items.
Under UK GAAP, the net benefit obligation was not recognized as a liability.
IX SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Under US GAAP, the Company accounts for share-based compensation plans using the fair value method prescribed by SFAS 123R Share-Based Payment.
SFAS 123R was applied prospectively to the unvested portion of awards that were outstanding as at January 1, 2005 and all awards granted, modified or settled on or after January 2, 2005.
Prior to January 2, 2005, the Company accounted for its stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Under IFRS, the Company accounts for share-based compensation plans using the fair value method prescribed by IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
IFRS 2 was applied retrospectively to all awards that were outstanding but had not vested as at January 1, 2005, except those equity-settled awards that were granted on or before November 7, 2002.
While differences between the compensation expense recognized under IFRS and US GAAP will exist in the medium-term, it is expected that they will be eliminated in future years when the outstanding unvested equity-settled awards granted on or before November 7, 2002 either vest or are forfeited due to failure to meet the service or non-market performance conditions that apply to them.
Under UK GAAP, the Company accounted for share-based compensation using the intrinsic value method specified by UITF 17Employee share schemes which differed in certain respects from that specified by APB25.
In particular, awards made under the Companys savings-related share option plan were regarded as non-compensatory under UITF17 whereas they were regarded as compensatory under APB25, and the compensation expense relating to deferred shares awarded under the Companys annual bonus plan was recognized at the grant date under UITF17 whereas it was recognized over the applicable vesting period under APB25.
X DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Under US GAAP, derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date and, in the absence of hedge accounting, changes in their fair values are reflected immediately in income.
Under IFRS prior to January 2, 2005 and under UK GAAP, derivative financial instruments were not generally recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and gains or losses arising on them were not recognized until the hedged item was itself recognised in the financial statements.
Under IFRS from January 2, 2005 onwards, derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date and, in the absence of hedge accounting, changes in their fair values are reflected immediately in income.
Under US GAAP and IFRS, the Company applies hedge accounting in certain circumstances where it is permissible to do so under the applicable accounting standards.
Fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments held to hedge translational exposures that are reflected in income because they do not qualify for hedge accounting are included in other income and do not affect operating income.

During fiscal 2005, the Company repatriated $75.9 million to the United States under the AJCA on which it incurred a tax charge of $3.8 million.
In fiscal 2005, there was a release of provisions for uncertain tax positions of $106.6 million following the successful resolution of a tax issue in the United States, the expiry of time during which tax audits could be performed in certain tax jurisdictions and the change of views on the likely outcome of challenges by various tax authorities.
FISCAL 2004 In fiscal 2004, the Company reached agreement with the US Internal Revenue Service with respect to the examination of the tax returns of one of its subsidiaries for fiscal years 1999, 2000 and 2001.
As a result, tax provisions of $27.4 million were no longer considered necessary and were released to the income statement in fiscal 2004.
FISCAL 2003 During fiscal 2003, following an extensive tax risk management study, the Company implemented a new methodology to estimate its provision for uncertain tax positions.
The principal change from the methodology used in prior periods was that the provision recognized was not assessed against a portfolio of tax exposures but, instead, provisions for uncertain tax positions were made on an item-by-item basis.
As a result, there was a reduction of $147.9 million in the Companys provision for uncertain tax positions which was released to the income statement in fiscal 2003.

As at December 31, 2005, the Company recognized a deferred tax asset of $26.3 million in respect of these losses, net of a valuation allowance of $589.4 million.
As at December 31, 2005, the Company had capital tax losses amounting to $491.6 million of which $490.5 million can be carried forward indefinitely and $1.1 million expire in 2009.
As at December 31, 2005, the Company recognized a deferred tax asset of $1.6 million in respect of these losses, net of a valuation allowance of $145.5 million.
As at December 31, 2005, the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to $3,345.8 million January 1, 2005 $2,848.8 million.
No income taxes have been provided on the Company's share of these undistributed earnings due to management's ability and intent to reinvest such amounts indefinitely.
A determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability has not been made because it is not practical to do so.

SUMMARY The carrying amount of derivative financial instruments held by the Company was as follows: As at December 31, 2005 As at January 1,2005 Assets Liabilities Net Assets Liabilities Net $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million Translational hedges: Currency forwards 0.2 13.9 13.7 13.0 13.0 Interest rate swaps 37.9 37.9 19.1 19.1 38.1 13.9 24.2 19.1 13.0 6.1 Transactional hedges: Currency forwards and swaps 4.8 1.5 3.3 0.2 0.2 42.9 15.4 27.5 19.3 13.0 6.3 Classified as: Current 8.9 15.4 6.5 0.7 13.0 12.3 Non-current 34.0 34.0 18.6 18.6 42.9 15.4 27.5 19.3 13.0 6.3 The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
The Company ensures that its portfolio of derivative financial instruments is managed such that there is no significant concentration of credit risk in any one bank or other financial institution.
CURRENCY DERIVATIVES As at December 31, 2005, the notional principal amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts that are used to manage the currency profile of the Companys net assets was $705.9 million January 1, 2005: $708.3 million.
These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and in fiscal 2005 the net fair value loss on these contracts of $62.7 million was recognized in other expense income fiscal 2004: net fair value gain of $22.2 million: fiscal 2003 net fair value gain of $57.0 million.
During fiscal 2005, the Company drew-down US-dollar denominated borrowings under its multi-currency revolving credit facility which had the effect of providing an economic hedge of the translational currency exposures arising on its net investment in certain of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is the US dollar.
As at December 31, 2005, the amount of US-dollar denominated borrowings outstanding under the facility was $175.0 million.
These borrowings do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS133 and in fiscal 2005, the attributable foreign currency translation loss of $9.5 million was recognized in other expense.
Also in fiscal 2005, a net gain of $1.0 million was recognized within other income in respect of other currency translation hedges that did not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS133 fiscal 2004: $nil: fiscal 2003: $nil.
In fiscal 2005, a net fair value gain of $0.6 million was recognized within operating income in respect of currency derivatives that were held to provide an economic hedge of transactional currency exposures but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes fiscal 2004: net fair value gain of $2.6 million: fiscal 2003 net fair value gain of $2.6 million.
C. INTEREST RATE SWAPS Interest rate swaps are used to swap borrowings under the Companys Euro Medium Term Note Program from fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.
As at December 31, 2005, the nominal value of the contracts outstanding was $686.7 million January 1, 2005: $768.0 million.
The Company had not previously elected to designate these contracts as fair value hedges in accordance with SFAS133, but during fiscal 2005 they were so designated and were subsequently considered to be effective hedges for accounting purposes.
As at December 31, 2005, an adjustment of $14.8 million was made to the carrying amount of the hedged borrowings to reflect the extent to which the swaps provided an effective hedge against fair value interest rate risk.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Interest rate swaps are also used to restrict the amount of floating rate US dollar debt.
As at December 31, 2005, the nominal value of these contracts held was $420 million January 1, 2005: $ 210 million, including contracts with a nominal value of $210 million that commence on the maturity of equivalent contracts that are currently in force in June 2006 and June 2008.
During fiscal 2005, a net gain of $6.0 million was recognized within other income that represented the net change in the fair value of interest rate swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS133 fiscal 2004: net fair value gain of $12.0 million: fiscal 2003 net fair value loss of $11.6 million.

Accordingly, their carrying amounts are considered to approximate to fair value.
Borrowings classified as current liabilities mainly comprise overdrafts and loans that attract floating interest rates.
Accordingly their carrying amount is considered to approximate to fair value.
Borrowings classified as non-current liabilities principally comprise borrowings under the Groups multi-currency revolving credit facility that attract floating interest rates, whose carrying amount is considered to approximate to fair value, and the listed bonds issued under the Groups Euro Medium Term Note Program, whose fair values represent their quoted market prices.
Capital lease obligations attract fixed interest rates that are implicit in the lease rentals and their fair value has been assessed by reference to prevailing market interest rates.
Interest rate derivatives are valued by discounting the applicable cash flows at prevailing market interest rates.
Foreign currency derivatives are valued on a mark to market basis by reference to prevailing currency exchange rates.
The Convertible cumulative preference shares are not traded in an organized market and their fair value has been assessed using a valuation model that takes into account prevailing market interest rates and the existence of the holders conversion option.

POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED PENSION PLAN ASSETS Pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, bonds and other fixed income securities, money market instruments, and insurance contracts.
The Companys weighted-average worldwide actual asset allocations at December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005 by asset category are as follows: Plan assets As at As at January 1, December 31, Target 2005 2005 allocation Asset category: Equity securities 60% 61% 65-75% Fixed income securities 35% 35% 27-33% Other assets 5% 4% 0-10% Total 100% 100% 100% The Companys investment strategy for pension plan assets includes diversification to minimize interest and market risks.
On December 1, 2005 the Tomkins North American Retirement Board redenominated existing fixed income assets in the US defined benefit pension plans amounting to $152.0 million and entered into $308.0 million of US dollar denominated interest rate swaps with a combined average duration of 11.5 years.
This has resulted in a hedge of the interest rate risk inherent in the accrued benefit obligation of the plans, whereby future changes in the accrued benefit obligation arising from changes in the interest rate will be matched by equal and opposite movements in the value of the assets, protecting the deficit from future interest rate changes.
In general, the investment strategy for non-US plans does not involve the use of derivative financial instruments.
Plan assets are re-balanced periodically to maintain target asset allocations.
Maturities of investments are not necessarily related to the timing of expected future benefit payments, but adequate liquidity to make immediate and medium term benefit payments is ensured.
CONTRIBUTIONS The Companys funding policy for its defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with federal law and other regulations.
Post retirement health and life insurance benefits are funded as incurred.
The Company expects to contribute approximately $69 million to its pension plans during fiscal 2006.
BENEFIT PAYMENTS The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service as appropriate, are expected to be paid: Pension Benefits Other Benefits UK Plans Non-UK Plans All Plans $ million $ million $ million Fiscal years: 2006 16.4 54.7 20.1 2007 17.2 54.0 20.3 2008 18.5 54.6 20.5 2009 18.4 55.2 20.4 2010 19.4 54.9 20.2 2011-2015 106.2 277.3 93.0 HEALTH CARE COST TRENDS AND THE IMPACT OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION ACT OF 2003 The weighted average annual rate of increase in the per-capita cost of covered benefits i. e. health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 8.68% for fiscal 2006, reducing gradually to 4.18% by fiscal 2011 and remaining at that level thereafter.
A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects as of December 31, 2005: 1 % point increase 1 % point decrease $ million $ million Effect on the total of service and interest cost 1.1 1.1 Effect on the post retirement benefit obligation 16.1 15.6 In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act was signed into law.
The Act introduced a plan sponsor subsidy based on a percentage of a beneficiarys annual prescription drug benefits, within defined limits, and the opportunity for a retiree to obtain prescription drug benefits under Medicare.
In January 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position FAS 106-1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act, or FSP FAS 106-1.
FSP FAS 106-1 allows for current recognition or a one-time deferral of the effects of the Act.
The deferral suspends the application of the measurement requirements of SFAS106 Employers Accounting for Post retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, and it revised the disclosure requirements of SFAS 132 Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits for pensions and other post retirement plans for the effects of the Act.
In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position FAS 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act, or FSP FAS 106-2, which supercedes FSP FAS 106-1 and provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Act and requires employers that sponsor post retirement healthcare plans that provide prescription drug benefits to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy included in the Act.
FSP FAS 106-2 was effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004 and did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005 GROUP US GAAP CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH US GAAP 161 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 18.
BACKGROUND The Company operates a number of share-based compensation plans to provide incentives to its senior management and other eligible employees.
Details of the plans in respect of which options and awards were outstanding as at December 31, 2005 are set out below.
The Company adopted SFAS123R Share-Based Payment using the modified prospective method with an effective date of January 2, 2005.
Prior to adopting SFAS123R, the Company accounted for share-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in APB25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
The Companys financial statements for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 have not been restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS123R.
Pro-forma information on the effect on the Companys net income and net income per common share for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 had the Company previously accounted for share-based compensation using the fair value method prescribed in SFAS123Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation is presented in Note 2.
Under SFAS 123, the Company recognized the effect of forfeitures due to failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions when they occurred.
Under SFAS 123R, the Company adjusts the compensation expense recognized in each period to reflect actual and expected forfeitures.
The cumulative effect of this change of accounting policy as at January 1, 2005 was not material.
The compensation expense recognized in income and the related income tax benefit in respect of share-based compensation plans was as follows: Year ended Year ended Year ended December 31, January 1, January 3, 2005 2005 2004 $ million $million $ million Equity-settled awards: Share options 9.8 0.6 7.2 Other equity-settled awards 5.6 3.7 1.1 15.4 4.3 8.3 Cash-settled awards 1.1 2.3 2.3 Total compensation expense 16.5 6.6 10.6 Income tax benefit 2.4 3.4 Effect on net income 16.5 4.2 7.2 B.
SHARE OPTIONS Following a review by management in fiscal 2004, it was decided that the Companys executive share option plans would not be renewed when they lapsed for the purposes of new grants in May 2005.
Accordingly, no new options were granted under these plans during fiscal 2005.
Options will continue to be granted from time to time under the Tomkins 2005 Sharesave Scheme, a savings related share option plan which is open to employees who are resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom.
Options granted under the Tomkins 2005 Sharesave Scheme generally vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date and expire if they are not exercised within six months of the vesting date.
Details of the share option plans that are closed for the purposes of new grants but under which options were outstanding as at December 31, 2005 are as follows: TOMKINS EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME NO.
3 ESOS 3 AND THE TOMKINS EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME NO.
4 ESOS 4 Options granted under ESOS3 and ESOS4 cannot generally be exercised until the third anniversary of the date of grant and until the performance condition has been satisfied.
The performance condition will be achieved if the rate of increase of the Companys earnings per share exceeds the growth in the United Kingdom Retail Prices Index by an average of 2 per cent per annum over any three-year period after the option is granted based on a simple arithmetic calculation that is made annually when the Companys results are known.
In any event, options granted under these plans generally expire if they are not exercised by the tenth anniversary of the grant date.
TOMKINS PREMIUM PRICED OPTION The Tomkins Premium Priced Option was an option specifically and solely granted to James Nicol as part of the incentive package to attract him to the Company.
It consists of a non-transferable option to acquire 5,076,142 shares granted on February 11, 2002.

C. OTHER EQUITY-SETTLED AWARDS Details of the other equity-settled plans operated by the Company under which awards were outstanding as at December 31, 2005 are as follows: ANNUAL BONUS INCENTIVE PLAN The Companys executive Directors and other senior executives participate in the Annual Bonus Incentive Plan ABIP.
Each participant in the plan receives a percentage of bonusable profit of the business for which he or she has responsibility.
Bonusable profit is based on operating profit less a charge for tax and a charge for invested capital.
Bonusable profit may also be adjusted for restructuring costs and, with the approval of the Remuneration Committee, certain other items such as gains or losses on the disposal and exit of businesses.
Senior participants receive their bonus as to four-sevenths in cash, one-seventh in bonus shares and two-sevenths in deferred shares.
Other participants receive their bonus as to three-quarters in cash, one-twelfth in bonus shares and one sixth in deferred shares.
Bonuses are paid at the end of June, September and December based on 75 per cent of the bonus earned to the end of the previous quarter, with the balance of the full entitlement to the bonus for the fiscal year paid at the end of March following the fiscal year-end.
Bonus shares are restricted and vest only after a period of three years after the initial bonus award.
Dividends are paid on the bonus shares.
Deferred shares are awarded at the time of the initial bonus award but the vesting of the shares is conditional on continued employment with the Company for three years after the award.
Dividends are not paid on the deferred shares until they have vested.
As a condition of continued participation in the Plan, senior participants are required to hold shares with a purchase cost equivalent to one years total after-tax remuneration including bonus, based on an average of the previous three years.
Other participants are required to hold shares with a purchase cost equivalent to one half of one years total after-tax remuneration including bonus, based on an average of the previous three years.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION CONTINUED SHARE MATCHING SCHEME The Tomkins Share Matching Scheme SMS was related to The Tomkins Restricted Share Plan RSP which closed for the purposes of new grants in fiscal 2000 01.

Awards made under the RSP were subject to forfeiture if the participant left the Company before the third anniversary of the grant date.
In the event that restricted shares vested under the RSP, the SMS provided for up to two conditional matching awards.
Each matching award was for the number of shares that had vested under the RSP with proportionate reductions in the event that the participant disposed of any shares that had vested under the RSP.
The first matching award under the SMS was subject to forfeiture if the participant left the Company before the second anniversary of the grant date.
The second matching award was made when the first matching award vested and was subject to forfeiture if the participant left the Company before the second anniversary of the grant date.
The final grant under the SMS was made during fiscal 2005 and the plan is now closed for the purposes of new grants.
Changes in the total number of awards outstanding under these plans during fiscal 2005 were as follows: Weighted average grant date Awards fair value Number Cents Outstanding as at January 1, 2005 1,889,075 469.83 Granted during the period 1,426,367 296.72 Forfeited during the period 18,701 487.25 Vested during the period 73,744 463.16 Outstanding as at December 31, 2005 3,222,997 468.10 During fiscal 2005, awards were made over 1,415,047 ordinary shares under ABIP and matching awards were made over 11,320 ordinary shares under the SMS.

The total intrinsic value of awards that vested under these plans during fiscal 2005 was $nil fiscal 2004: $2.9 million: fiscal 2003: $0.9 million.
The tax benefit realized by the Company on the vesting of these awards was $nil fiscal 2004: $1.0 million: fiscal 2003: $0.3 million.
The fair value of awards made under these plans is measured based on the market price of the Companys ordinary shares on the date of the award.

RESTRUCTURING CONTINUED INDUSTRIAL & AUTOMOTIVE The loss of a local major customer and uncompetitive labor costs resulted in the decision to announce the closure of the Companys curved hose production plant in Nowra, Australia.
The plant will close in July 2006 allowing time to honor current customer commitments.
Due to continued losses, Wipers announced its intention to transfer the remaining manufacturing capability from the Wiper Systems plant in Pontypool, Wales to more cost competitive locations.
The transfer will complete in the first half of fiscal 2006.
Taken together, these projects will result in the termination of 362 employees in fiscal 2006.
AIR SYSTEMS COMPONENTS In Air Systems Components, a number of plant rationalizations occurred with the closure of the Tabor City and Englewood facilities and the transfer to production to lower cost facilities.
