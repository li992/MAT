Deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: Assets Liabilities Net asset liability At 31 December 2005 At 31 December 2004 At 31 December 2005 At 31 December 2004 At 31 December 2005 At 31 December 2004 000 000 000 000 000 000 Property, plant and equipment 3,081 398 3,081 398 Intangible assets 99 42 99 42 Goodwill on US acquisitions 1,878 3,022 1,682 1,144 1,682 Share options 1,034 45 1,034 45 Provisions 7,383 836 7,383 836 Business combinations 41,368 41,368 Accrued interest 2,525 61 2,525 61 Value of recognised tax losses 11,949 5,583 11,949 5,583 Total deferred tax assets liabilities 24,769 6,525 47,570 2,122 22,801 4,403 In addition to the deferred tax assets liabilities that were recognised for UK GAAP purposes the Group has this year recognised additional temporary differences as a result of adopting IFRS.
The additional impact of this is detailed below.
Goodwill on US acquisitions IFRS requires that deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences which are expected to be recovered.
A temporary difference arises between the tax and accounting treatment of the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the assets made by Gyrus e. g. the ENT Division.
For tax purposes, relief is obtained on the goodwill whereas for accounting purposes, the amount is no longer amortised only tested for impairment.
As a result of translating the deferred tax asset associated with the goodwill relief, a foreign exchange loss has been charged to reserves.
Share options In accordance with IFRS 2 Share based payments the Group has recognised a charge to the income statement which represents the fair value of outstanding share based payments granted to employees.
However, for tax purposes, most option schemes will only give rise to a deduction at the date of exercise, thus giving rise to a temporary timing difference between the accounting and tax treatment.
IFRS requires that deferred tax is recognised on this temporary difference which is expected to be recovered.
The basis of calculation for deferred taxation is the difference between the market price at the balance sheet date and the exercise price of the share based payment reflecting expected levels of vesting.
Business combinations Under IFRS, a deferred tax balance is recognised in a business combination for any difference between the fair value of an acquired asset and its equivalent tax base.
The intangible assets acquired during the acquisitions made during 2005 have been recognised for accounting purposes but have no equivalent tax basis.
The Group has therefore recognised an incremental deferred tax liability of 41,368,000 on these acquisitions, with a corresponding asset recognised within goodwill.
