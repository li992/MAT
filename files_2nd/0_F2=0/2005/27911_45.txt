FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups operations are financed principally by floating rate, asset backed loan notes and, to a lesser extent, by a mixture of share capital, retained earnings, corporate debt and bank borrowings.
The Group issues financial instruments to finance its lending operations and uses derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk arising from fixed rate lending or borrowing.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example debtors, prepayments and accruals, arise directly from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The principal risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The Board operates through the Asset and Liability Committee to review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged throughout the year and since the year end and the position disclosed below is materially similar to that existing throughout the year.
