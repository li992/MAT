b Property management undertakings i As part of their investment strategy, the UK and certain European long-term business policyholder funds have invested in a number of property limited partnerships PLPs, either directly or via property unit trusts PUTs, through a mix of capital and loans.
The PLPs are managed by general partners GPs, in which the long-term business shareholder companies hold equity stakes and which themselves hold nominal stakes in the PLPs.
The PUTs are managed by a Group subsidiary.
Most of the PLPs have raised external debt, secured on their respective property portfolios.
The lenders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both interest and principal, to the extent that there are sufficient resources in the respective PLPs.
The lenders have no recourse whatsoever to the policyholder or shareholders funds of any company in the Aviva Group.
Accounting for the PUTs and PLPs as subsidiaries, joint ventures or other financial investments depends on the shareholdings in the GPs and the terms of each partnership agreement.
Where the Group exerts control over a PLP, it has been treated as a subsidiary and its results, assets and liabilities have been consolidated.
Where the partnership is managed by a contractual agreement such that no party exerts control, notwithstanding that the Groups partnership share in the PLP including its indirect take via the relevant PUT and GP may be greater than 50%, such PUTs and PLPs have been classied as jointly-controlled entities.
These are accounted for as joint ventures, and are covered in this note.
Where the Group holds minority stakes in PLPs, with no disproportionate inuence, the relevant investments are included in financial investments at their fair value.
