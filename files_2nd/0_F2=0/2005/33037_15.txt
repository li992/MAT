United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles The United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles are divided into the following sections: 113 Differences between United Kingdom and United States generally accepted accounting principles 116 Net income and shareholders equity reconciliation statements 116 Minority interests 117 Accounting for share options 117 Consolidated statements of cash ows 117 Current asset investments 118 Pension costs 120 Income statement in US GAAP format 120 US GAAP developments 121 Supplemental unaudited pro forma information relating to businesses acquired during the year ended 31 March 2005 112 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 The groups consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK UK GAAP, which differ in certain respects from those applicable in the US US GAAP.
i Differences between United Kingdom and United States generally accepted accounting principles The following are the main differences between UK and US GAAP which are relevant to the groups financial statements.
a Sale and leaseback of properties Under UK GAAP, the sale of BTs property portfolio is treated as a xed asset disposal and the subsequent leaseback is an operating lease.
Under US GAAP, the transaction is regarded as nancing and the land and buildings are recorded on the balance sheet at their net book value, an obligation equivalent to the cash proceeds is recognised and the gain on disposal is deferred until the properties are vacated by BT.
Rental payments made by BT are reversed and replaced by a finance lease interest charge and a depreciation charge.
b Pension costs Under UK GAAP, pension costs are accounted for in accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
24, with costs being charged against profits over employees working lives.
Under US GAAP, pension costs are determined in accordance with the requirements of US Statements of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS Nos.
Differences between the UK and US GAAP gures arise from the requirement to use different actuarial methods and assumptions and a different method of amortising surpluses or deficits.
c Accounting for redundancies Under UK GAAP, the cost of providing incremental pension benets in respect of workforce reductions is taken into account when determining current and future pension costs, unless the most recent actuarial valuation, combined with the provision for pension costs in the group balance sheet, under UK actuarial conventions, shows a deficit.
In this case, the cost of providing incremental pension benets is included in redundancy charges in the year in which the employees agree to leave the group.
Under US GAAP, the associated costs of providing incremental pension benets are charged against profits in the period in which the termination terms are agreed with the employees.
The fair value of termination benets for employees who are to be retained beyond their minimum contractual retention period is recognised on a straight line basis over the future service period.
d Capitalisation of interest Under UK GAAP, the group does not capitalise interest.
To comply with US GAAP, the estimated amount of interest incurred whilst constructing major capital projects is included in xed assets, and depreciated over the lives of the related assets.
The amount of interest capitalised is determined by reference to the average interest rates on outstanding borrowings.
At 31 March 2005 under US GAAP, gross capitalised interest of 349 million 2004 358 million with regard to the company and its subsidiary companies was subject to depreciation generally over periods of 3 to 25 years.
e Goodwill Under UK GAAP, in respect of acquisitions completed prior to 1 April 1998, the group wrote off goodwill arising from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures on acquisition against retained earnings.
The goodwill is reected in the net income of the period of disposal, as part of the calculation of the gain or loss on divestment.
Following the implementation of UK Financial Reporting Standard No.
10 FRS 10, goodwill arising on acquisitions completed after 1 April 1998 is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life.
All unamortised and pre-April 1998 goodwill will be brought back to the profit and loss account on disposal.
Under US GAAP up to 31 March 2002, goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures was capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over its useful life.
142 on 1 April 2002 and goodwill is no longer amortised but tested annually for impairment.
In connection with the adoption of SFAS No.
142 transitional and annual impairment reviews were performed.
There was no transitional impairment charge recorded.
As a result of the annual impairment review, no goodwill impairment charge was recognised in the year ended 31 March 2005 2004 nil, 2003 54 million.
Goodwill of 16 million 2004 12 million, 2003 20 million amortised under UK GAAP is written back through the income statement.
f Intangible assets Certain intangible xed assets recognised under US GAAP purchase accounting requirements are subsumed within goodwill under UK GAAP.
The intangible assets acquired in the 2005 financial year comprise customer relationships and brand relating to Infonet see note 15.
Under US GAAP these separately identied intangible assets are valued and amortised over their useful lives which range from 5 to 15 years.
g Financial instruments Under UK GAAP, investments are held on the balance sheet at historical cost.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedges are not recognised until the exposure being hedged is recognised.
Under US GAAP, trading securities and available-for-sale securities are carried at market value with appropriate valuation adjustments recorded in profit and loss and shareholders equity, respectively.
United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 113 i Differences between United Kingdom and United States generally accepted accounting principles continued Certain derivative financial instruments which qualify for hedge accounting under UK GAAP do not qualify for hedge accounting under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP, financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting due to the extensive documentation requirements.
These financial instruments, under US GAAP, are carried at market value with valuation adjustments recorded in the income statement.
The reassessment and purchase of derivatives in the year ended 31 March 2005 gave rise to an adjustment reducing net income by 299 million net of tax 2004 reduction 133 million, 2003 reduction 610 million.
The net unrealised holding gain on equity investments held as availablefor-sale securities for the year ended 31 March 2005 was 19 million 2004 5 million, 2003 22 million.
h Employee share plans Certain share options have been granted under BT save-as-you-earn plans at a 20% discount.
Under UK GAAP, the share issues are recorded at their discounted price when the options are exercised.
Under US GAAP, a plan is considered compensatory when the discount to market price is in excess of 15%.
Compensation cost is recognised for the difference between the exercise price of the share options granted and the quoted market price of the shares at the date of grant or measurement date and accrued over the vesting period of the options.
i Investments in associates Under UK GAAP, the economic interest in the associates operating profits before minority interest is reported as part of the total operating profit.
For those associates in which a minority interest is recognised in their respective statements of profit and loss, such minority interest is reported as minority interest in the consolidated profit and loss account.
Under US GAAP, the minority interest in the associates is reclassied from minority interest and reported within the share of results of associates.
j Deferred taxation Under UK GAAP, provision is made for deferred tax in so far as a liability or asset arose as a result of transactions that had occurred by the balance sheet date and give rise to an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future.
Under US GAAP, deferred taxation is provided for on a full liability basis.
Future tax benets are recognised as deferred tax assets to the extent that their realisation is more likely than not.
At 31 March 2005 total deferred tax liabilities were 2,715 million primarily in respect of accelerated capital allowances and total deferred tax assets were 2,221 million, primarily in respect of pension obligations.
The total valuation allowance recognised for deferred tax assets was as follows: Movement in 2005 2004 year m m m Capital losses 4,436 4,843 407 Overseas losses not utilised 860 572 288 Other 705 419 286 6,001 5,834 167 At 31 March 2005 the group had operating losses and capital losses carried forward.
The groups capital losses have no expiry date restrictions.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arise.
A summary of expiry dates for losses in territories in which restrictions do apply is set out below: Valuation Territory allowance Expiry of losses m Restricted losses: Americas 79 2015-2025 Europe 222 2006-2020 Total restricted losses 301 Unrestricted losses: Operating losses 559 No expiry Capital losses 4,436 No expiry Total unrestricted losses 4,995 Total 5,296 114 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles i Differences between United Kingdom and United States generally accepted accounting principles continued The following is a reconciliation from UK to US GAAP of BTs deferred tax assets and liabilities net of related valuation allowance.

Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in which dividends are declared.
l Impairment Under UK GAAP, if there is an indication of impairment the assets should be tested for impairment and, if necessary written down to the value in use, calculated based on discounted future pre-tax cash ows related to the asset or the income generating unit to which the asset belongs.
US GAAP requires that an entity assess whether impairment has occurred based on the undiscounted future cash ows.
An impairment loss exists if the sum of these cash ows is less than the carrying amount of the asset.
The impairment loss recognised in the income statement is based on the assets fair value, being either market value or the sum of discounted future cash ows.
Tangible assets that were not impaired under US GAAP are depreciated over their remaining useful lives.
m Disposals of businesses There are timing differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP for recognition of gains on the sale of certain businesses.
Foreign exchange movements taken to reserves under UK GAAP are reported in the income statement under US GAAP.
Historical GAAP differences on disposed businesses are also shown under this line item.
n Property rationalisation provision Under UK GAAP in the 2003 financial year, a provision in connection with the rationalisation of the groups London ofce property portfolio was recorded.
Under US GAAP, in accordance with SFAS No 146, these costs are not recognised until the group fully exits and therefore ceases to use the affected properties.
All these properties were exited by 31 December 2004. o Revenue Under UK GAAP long-term contracts to design, build and operate software solutions are accounted for under SSAP 9 Stocks and long-term contracts and FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions, under which turnover is recognised as earned over the contract period.
Under US GAAP revenue of 162 million under these contracts is deferred in the 2005 financial year under SOP 97- 2Software revenue recognition and SAB 104, as vendor specic objective evidence to support the fair value of the separate elements to be delivered is unavailable.
There was no impact on net income.
Total deferred revenue and costs not recorded in UK GAAP at 31 March 2005 was 239 million 2004 77 million.
United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 115 ii Net income and shareholders equity reconciliation statements The following statements summarise the material estimated adjustments, gross of their tax effect, which reconcile net income and shareholders equity from that reported under UK GAAP to that which would have been reported had US GAAP been applied.

Shareholders equity 2005 2004 At 31 March m m Shareholders equity under UK GAAP 3,851 3,066 Re-statement under UITF 38 and UITF 17 see note 1 28 Shareholders equity under UK GAAP as previously reported 3,851 3,094 Adjustment for: Sale and leaseback of properties 1,460 1,377 Pension costs 5,219 5,714 Redundancy charges 20 Capitalisation of interest, net of related depreciation 178 195 Goodwill 51 124 Intangible assets 78 Financial instruments 371 8 Impairment 77 100 Property rationalisation provision 5 Deferred taxation 56 59 Dividend declared after the financial year end 551 454 2,320 3,166 Tax effect of US GAAP adjustments 1,736 1,711 Shareholders equity as adjusted for US GAAP 584 1,455 iii Minority interests Under US GAAP, the income to minority interests would have been unchanged 2004 unchanged, 2003 27 million reduction after adjusting for goodwill amortisation and accounting for associates and joint ventures.
Net assets attributable to minority interests would have been unchanged 2004 unchanged after adjusting for financial instruments.
116 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles iv Accounting for share options Under UK GAAP, the company does not recognise compensation expense for the fair value, at the date of grant, of share options granted under the employee share option schemes.
Under US GAAP, the company adopted the disclosure-only provisions in SFAS No.
Accordingly, the company accounts for share options in accordance with APB Opinion No.
25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, under which no compensation expense on xed plans, other than SAYE plans, is recognised.
Had the group recognised compensation cost for options granted in accordance with SFAS No.
123, the groups pro forma net income loss, basic earnings loss per share and diluted earnings loss per share under US GAAP would have been 1,289 million 2004 862 million, 2003 4,127 million, 15.1p 2004 10.0p, 2003 47.9p and 15.0p 2004 9.9p, 2003 47.6p, respectively.
123 disclosures of the fair value of options granted under employee schemes at date of grant.
v Consolidated statements of cash ows Under UK GAAP, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are presented in accordance with UK Financial Reporting Standard No.
The statements prepared under FRS 1 present substantially the same information as that required under SFAS No.
95, cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.
Under FRS 1 cash comprises cash in hand and at bank and overnight deposits, net of bank overdrafts.
Under FRS 1, cash ows are presented for operating activities: returns on investments and servicing of finance: taxation: capital expenditure and financial investments: acquisitions and disposals: dividends paid to the companys shareholders: management of liquid resources and nancing.
95 requires a classication of cash ows as resulting from operating, investing and nancing activities.
Cash ows under FRS 1 in respect of interest received, interest paid net of that capitalised under US GAAP and taxation would be included within operating activities under SFAS No.
Cash ows from purchases, sales and maturities of trading securities, while not separately identied under UK GAAP, would be included within operating activities under US GAAP.
Capitalised interest, while not recognised under UK GAAP, is included in investing activities under US GAAP.
Dividends paid are included within nancing activities under US GAAP.
The following statements summarise the statements of cash ows as if they had been presented in accordance with US GAAP, and include the adjustments which reconcile cash and cash equivalents under US GAAP to cash at bank and in hand reported under UK GAAP.
2005 2004 2003 m m m Net cash provided by operating activities 4,586 4,632 3,395 Net cash used provided by investing activities 2,012 3,460 1,253 Net cash used in nancing activities 2,269 3,093 2,852 Net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents 305 1,921 1,796 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 5 13 Cash and cash equivalents under US GAAP at beginning of year 1,007 2,933 1,124 Cash and cash equivalents under US GAAP at end of year 1,312 1,007 2,933 Short-term investments with original maturities of less than three months 1,106 898 2,842 Cash at bank and in hand under UK GAAP at end of year 206 109 91 vi Current asset investments Under US GAAP, investments in debt securities would be classied as either trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
Trading investments would be stated at fair values and the unrealised gains and losses would be included in income.
Securities classied as available-for-sale would be stated at fair values, with unrealised gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, reported in shareholders equity.
Debt securities classied as held-to-maturity would be stated at amortised cost.
The following analyses do not include securities with original maturities of less than three months.
At 31 March 2005, the group held trading investments as dened by US GAAP with fair values totalling 339 million 2004 423 million.
Held-to-maturity securities at 31 March 2005 and 2004 consisted of the following: Amortised Estimated cost fair value m m Commercial paper, medium-term notes and other investments at 31 March 2005 2,003 2,003 Commercial paper, medium-term notes and other investments at 31 March 2004 3,629 3,629 The contractual maturities of the held-to-maturity debt securities at 31 March 2005 were as follows: Amortised Estimated cost fair value m m Maturing on or before 31 March 2006 1,999 1,999 Maturing after 1 year through 5 years 44 Total at 31 March 2005 2,003 2,003 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 117 vi Current asset investments continued Available for sale investments at 31 March 2005 and 2004 consisted of the following: Amortised Estimated cost fair value m m Commercial paper, medium-term notes and other investments at 31 March 2005 1,149 1,149 Commercial paper, medium-term notes and other investments at 31 March 2004 214 214 The contractual maturities of the available for sale investments at 31 March 2005 were as follows: Amortised Estimated cost fair value m m Maturing on or before 31 March 2006 1,149 1,149 Maturing after 1 year through 5 years Total at 31 March 2005 1,149 1,149 vii Pension costs The following position for the main pension scheme is computed in accordance with US GAAP pension accounting rules under SFAS No.
88, the effect of which is shown in the above reconciliation statements.
The pension cost determined under SFAS No.
87 was calculated by reference to an expected long-term rate of return on scheme assets of 7.27% 2004 7.35%, 2003 6.90%.
The components of the pension cost for the main pension scheme comprised: 2005 2004 2003 m m m Service cost 507 388 453 Interest cost 1,745 1,657 1,707 Expected return on scheme assets 1,897 1,646 1,813 Amortisation of prior service costs 24 24 24 Amortisation of net obligation at date of limited application of SFAS No.

Asset allocation The Trustees of the main pension scheme approve the target asset allocation as well as deviation limits.
The objective of the investment activities is to maximise investment return within an acceptable level of risk, taking into consideration the liabilities of the main pension scheme.

The expected returns on bonds are based on the gross redemption yields at the start of the year.
Expected returns on equities and property are based on a combination of an estimate of the risk premium above, yields on government bonds and consensus economic forecasts of future returns.
The expected return of 7.27% per annum used for the calculation of pension costs for the year ending 31 March 2005 is consistent with that adopted for FRS 17. viii Income statement in US GAAP format The group profit and loss accounts on pages 75 to 77 comply with UK GAAP and the directors believe they are in the most appropriate format for shareholders to understand the results of our business.
We believe that it is important to show our results before deducting goodwill amortisation and exceptional items because these items predominantly relate to corporate transactions rather than the trading activities of the group.
For SEC reporting purposes this presentation would be considered non GAAP and therefore the group has also prepared the following income statement which meets the SEC reporting format set forth in Item 10 of Regulation S-X.
The financial numbers disclosed in the following income statement are prepared under UK GAAP.
2005 2004 2003 a a m m m Revenue 18,623 18,519 18,727 Operating expenses: Payroll costs 3,729 3,738 3,667 Depreciation and amortisation 2,856 2,936 3,035 Payments to telecommunication operators 3,725 3,963 3,940 Other operating expenses 5,695 5,189 5,724 Total operating expenses 16,005 15,826 16,366 Net operating income 2,618 2,693 2,361 Other income, net 551 227 1,922 Net interest expense 801 941 1,439 Income taxes 523 539 459 Minority interests 1 8 12 Equity in losses earnings of investees 25 34 329 Net income 1,821 1,414 2,702 Earnings per share basic 21.4p 16.4p 31.4p Earnings per share diluted 21.2p 16.3p 31.2p a Restated following the adoption of UITF17 and UITF38 see note 1 on page 81. ix US GAAP developments In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123R SFAS 123R ShareBased Payment which revises SFAS 123 and supersedes APB 25.
SFAS 123R requires that the cost of all share-based payment transactions be recognised in the financial statements.
SFAS 123R also establishes fair value as the measurement method in accounting for share-based payments to employees.
BT adopted SFAS 123R on 1 April 2005 using the modied prospective transition method.
BT estimates the application of the expensing provisions of SFAS 123R will result in a pre-tax expense of approximately 45 million in the 2006 financial year subject to additional grants and awards.
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
153 SFAS 153 Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion No.
29 SFAS 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of non-monetary assets.
It eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21 b of APB Opinion No.
29 Accounting for Non-monetary Transactions and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance.
A non-monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash ows of the entity are expected to change signicantly as a result of the exchange.
As required by SFAS 153, we will adopt this new accounting standard effective 1 July 2005.
The adoption of SFAS 153 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash ows.
In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
151 SFAS 151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No.
43, Chapter 4, which claries that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material spoilage should be recognised as a current period expense.
In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of xed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.
SFAS 151 is effective for scal years beginning after 15 June 2005.
BT does not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash ows.
120 BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ix US GAAP developments continued In September 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No.
02-14 Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock, in which the Task Force reached the consensus that an investor that has the ability to exercise significant inuence over the operating and financial policies of the investee should apply the equity method of accounting when it has an investment in common stock and or an investment that is in-substance common stock.
The consensus of this EITF is to be applied in reporting periods beginning after September 15, 2004.

04-1 Accounting for Pre-existing Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination EITF 04-1.
EITF 04-1 addresses the accounting treatment of pre-existing relationships between the parties of a business combination.
The consensus of EITF 04-1 should be applied to business combinations consummated and goodwill impairment tests performed in reporting periods beginning after the FASB ratied the consensus at its October 13, 2004 meeting.
The group will adopt the provisions of EITF 04-1 as of April 1, 2005.
If it is determined that assets of an acquired entity are related to a pre-existing contractual relationship, thus requiring accounting separate from the business combination, BT will evaluate whether the acquiring entity of the group should recognise contractual relationships as assets separate from goodwill in that business combination.

FSP EITF 03-1-1 delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10-20 of EITF 03-1.
The disclosure requirements of EITF 03-1 remain effective for scal years ending after June 15, 2004.
No effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance has been established in FSP EITF 03-1-1.
During the period of delay, FSP EITF 03-1-1 states that companies should continue to apply current guidance to determine if an impairment is other-than-temporary.
The adoption of EITF 03-1, excluding paragraphs 10-20, did not impact the groups consolidated position, results of operations or cash ows.
The group will assess the impact of paragraphs 10-20 of EITF 03-1 once the guidance has been nalised.
