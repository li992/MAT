Market capitalisation The market capitalisation of PartyGaming Plc as at 31 December 2005 was 5.4 billion equivalent to US$9.4 billion.
The Company is ranked within the FTSE 100 Index of companies.
Depositary Interests The Company has entered into depositary interest arrangements to enable investors to settle and pay for interests in the Shares through the CREST system.
CREST is a paperless settlement system allowing securities to be transferred from one persons CREST account to another without the need to use share certificates or written instruments of transfer.
Securities issued by non-UK companies, such as PartyGaming, cannot be held or transferred in the CREST system.
Under arrangements put in place by the Company, a depositary holds the Shares and has issued dematerialised depositary interests representing the underlying Shares which are held on trust for the holders of the Depositary Interests.
Capita IRG Trustees Limited Capita IRG Trustees or the Depositary, a sister company of PartyGamings Registrars, Capita IRG Offshore Limited, has issued the dematerialised depositary interests or Depositary Interests.
The Depositary Interests are independent securities constituted under English law which may be held and transferred through the CREST system.
The Depositary Interests have been created pursuant to and issued on the terms of a deed poll executed by Capita IRG Trustees in favour of the holders of the Depositary Interests from time to time the Deed Poll.
As at 31 December 2005 893,793,041 Shares were held by the Depositary in respect of a total 893,793,041 Depositary Interests.
There were 1,316 Depositary Interest Holders on the Depositary Interest register as at that date.
Each Depositary Interest is treated as one Share for the purposes of determining, for example, eligibility for any dividends.
Capita IRG Trustees will pass on to holders of Depositary Interests any stock or cash benefits received by it as the holder of Shares on trust for such Depositary Interest holder.
Depositary Interest holders will also be able to receive notices of meetings of holders of Shares and other notices issued by the Company to its shareholders.
The Depositary must pass on to Depositary Interest Holders and, so far as they are reasonably able, exercise on behalf of Depositary Interest Holders all rights and entitlements received or to which they are entitled in respect of the underlying Shares which are capable of being passed on or exercised.
Rights and entitlements to cash distributions, to information, to make choices and elections and to call for, attend and vote at meetings shall, subject to the Deed Poll, be passed on in the form in which they are received together with amendments and additional documentation necessary to effect such passing-on, or, as the case may be, exercised in accordance with the Deed Poll.
The Depositary Interests have the same ISIN and SEDOL numbers as the underlying Shares and do not have a separate listing on the Official List.

Dividends are not subject to any withholding tax in Gibraltar and are therefore paid gross.
For further information, see the taxation section elsewhere in this Shareholder Information section.
The first dividend to be recommended by the Board following the Offer is the final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2005.
As anticipated and explained in the Listing Particulars this dividend represents two thirds of the total dividend which would have been paid for the full year 2005 had the Company been listed since 1 January 2005.
Subject to this final dividend being approved by Shareholders at the AGM on 4 May 2006 this dividend will be paid to Shareholders and Depositary Interest Holders on 19 May 2006.
The record date for the final dividend is 7 April 2006 and the Shares go ex-dividend on 5 April 2006.
Dividends will be declared and paid by the Company in US dollars.
In order to assist Shareholders and Depositary Interest Holders, the cash dividend may be paid either in US dollars or, if holders so elect, in Pounds Sterling.
Should you wish to elect to receive this dividend and all future dividends in Pounds Sterling you should follow the instructions below.
If you make no election you will continue to receive your dividend in US dollars.
If you elect to receive your dividend payable on 19 May 2006 in Pounds Sterling, the exchange rate for the purchase of Pounds Sterling with US dollars quoted by the Company at or about 5.00 p. m. 4.00 p. m. BST on 28 April 2006 will apply.
Please note that Shareholders and Depositary Interest Holders will only be able to use the procedure mentioned below for making their currency election.
No other form of election will be accepted.
Procedure for Depositary Interest Holders If you hold your Shares in Depositary Interest form in CREST and will continue to do so at 5.00 p. m. on the relevant dividend record date and whether or not you have validly elected to receive your dividends in CREST, you may elect to receive your dividend in Pounds Sterling by means of the CREST procedures to effect such an election referred to below.
If you are a CREST Personal Member, or other CREST Sponsored Member, you should consult your CREST sponsor, who will be able to take the appropriate action on your behalf.
The CREST procedures require the use of the Dividend Election Input Message in accordance with the CREST Manual.
The message includes the following fields which, for a valid election to be made, must be correctly input as indicated below by close of business on the Pound Sterling election deadline 20 April 2006 for the final dividend payable on 19 May 2006. i Dividend Election Reference you must indicate here a reference for the dividend election which is unique to your CREST participant I. D. : ii Account ID If you have more than one member account, you must indicate the member account I. D. to which the election relates: the relevant account must be enabled i at the time your Dividend Election Input Message is entered into CREST, and ii on the relevant dividend payment date: iii ISIN This is GI000A0ERMF2: iv Evergreen This field must be entered with its flag set to yes.
This requests the Company to apply your election to the current dividend and to all future dividends in respect of your entire Depositary Interest holding in CREST at each relevant record date until i you delete your Dividend Election Input Message and that deletion is accepted in accordance with the CREST procedures on behalf of the Company, ii you transfer your Depositary Interest holding in CREST, or iii the facility is withdrawn by the Directors: v Corporate Action Number This is not to be input: vi Distribution type You must enter currency here: vii Currency code This is GBP: viii Number of shares This field should be left blank.
If this field is completed, the message will be rejected: ix Contact details this field is optional, although you are asked to include details of whom to contact in the event of a query relating to your election.
A valid election made by means of Dividend Election Input Message will, to the extent it relates to Shares held in Depositary Interests at the relevant record date, supersede all previous written elections made in respect of holdings in the same member account.
You may only revoke an election which has been made by Dividend Election Input Message by utilising the CREST procedures for deletions described in the CREST Manual.
The deletion will be valid in relation to the then current dividend only if the deletion is accepted, in accordance with the CREST procedures, by or on behalf of the Company prior to close of business on the Pound Sterling election deadline 20 April 2006 for the final dividend payable on 19 May 2006.
With respect to subsequent dividend payments, the valid revocation must be received by the record date for the relevant dividend payment.
It is recommended that you input any deletion message 48 hours in advance of this deadline to give the Company or its agent sufficient time to accept the deletion.
There is no facility to amend an election which has been made by Dividend Election Input Message: if you wish to change your election details, you must first delete the existing election as described above and then input a Dividend Election Input Message with the required new details.
Any attempts to send a new Dividend Election Input Message, where an existing Dividend Election Message is present and has not been deleted, will be rejected.

Depositary Interest Holders not wishing to attend the AGM but wishing to vote in respect of the resolutions to be considered at the AGM can do so by instructing the Depositary.
This may be done in one of two ways: i Depositary Interest Holders who are CREST members may give such an instruction utilising the CREST electronic voting service in accordance with the procedures described in the CREST Manual.
CREST personal Depositary Holders or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider, should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider, who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
