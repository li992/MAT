Financial instruments Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The carrying amounts and estimated fair value of the Groups outstanding financial instruments are set out below: 2005 2005 2004 2004 Net carrying Estimated fair Net carrying Estimated fair amount value amount value m m m m Fixed asset investments excluding investments in associated undertakings 852 1,182 1,049 1,290 Cash at bank and in hand 2,850 2,850 1,409 1,409 Liquid investments 788 788 4,381 4,381 Borrowings: Short term 392 390 1,974 2,034 Long term 11,613 12,023 12,224 13,029 Derivative financial instruments: Interest rate 120 343 Foreign exchange 28 28 80 80 The Groups exposure to market risk, which is the sensitivity of the value of financial instruments to changes in related currency and interest rates, is minimised because gains and losses on the underlying assets and liabilities offset gains and losses on derivative financial instruments.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values shown above.
Fixed asset investments excluding investments in joint ventures and associated undertakings The net book value of xed asset investments at 31 March 2005 comprises investments recorded at an original cost of 1,803 million 2004: 2,079 million.
Listed investments are stated at fair value based on their quoted share price at 31 March 2005.
Cash at bank and in hand and liquid investments The carrying values of cash and liquid investments approximate to their fair values because of the short term maturity of these instruments.
Borrowings excluding foreign exchange contracts The fair value of quoted long term borrowings is based on year end mid-market quoted prices.
The book values stated above exclude accrued interest on borrowings which is recorded separately on the balance sheet within accruals and deferred income.
The fair value of other borrowings is estimated by discounting the future cash ows to net present values using appropriate market interest and foreign currency rates prevailing at the year end.
Foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and futures The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and futures in order to manage its foreign currency and interest rate exposure.
The book values stated above exclude accrued interest which is recorded separately in the balance sheet.
The fair value of these financial instruments was estimated by discounting the future cash ows to net present values using appropriate market interest and foreign currency rates prevailing at the year end.
Hedges The Groups policy is to use derivative instruments to hedge against exposure to movements in interest rates and exchange rates.
Changes in the fair value of instruments used for hedging are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged exposure is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are set out below: Total net Gains Losses gains losses m m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 April 2004 423 80 343 Less: gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised in the year 91 23 68 Gains and losses arising before 1 April 2004 that were not recognised at 31 March 2005 332 57 275 Gains and losses arising in the year that were not recognised at 31 March 2005 96 59 155 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 March 2005 236 116 120 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised in the year ending 31 March 2006 64 28 36 In addition to the amounts disclosed above, cumulative aggregate gains of 453 million in respect of terminated interest rate swaps were carried forward in the balance sheet at 31 March 2005 pending their recognition in the profit and loss account 2004: 607 million.
Of these carried forward amounts, gains of 91 million are expected to be recognised in the profit and loss account in the 2006 financial year.
Aggregate related gains of 154 million from previous years were recognised in the profit and loss account in the 2005 financial year 2004: 90 million.
Currency exposures Taking into account the effect of forward contracts and other derivative instruments, the Group did not have any material financial exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 31 March 2005.
