Discontinued activities in 2004 were the Groups joint venture investments in Aerospace companies which contributed 62 million of post-tax earnings in the year and a further 825 million post-tax profit on their disposal.
Intra-group sales, which are priced on an arms length basis, between both segments and regions are not significant.
The analyses of operating profit by business include an allocation, based on their nature, of costs incurred centrally in the United Kingdom and United States of America.
Unallocated costs represent corporate expenses.
Segment assets comprise all non-current and current assets as per the balance sheet presented on page 40 but exclude deferred tax assets and cash and cash equivalents.
Segment liabilities include trade and other payables, provisions and post-employment obligations but exclude borrowings and taxation liabilities.
Cash and cash equivalents and borrowings are not allocated to specic segments as these resources are managed centrally and no business in any segment has sufficient autonomy to manage these resources.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the year to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one year.

They include the impact of restructuring actions at GKN Driveline Torque Technology KK which involved announced headcount reductions 1 million, property impairments 4 million relating to site rationalisations and a pension settlement credit of 7 million arising from the negotiated withdrawal from a multi-employer dened benefit pension scheme.
The pension settlement credit arises from a provision originally established in the fair value acquisition balance sheet.
Other redundancy costs in the year amounted to 5 million 2004 5 million.

Charges recognised in the year in respect of this programme amount to 77 million which comprises asset impairment charges of 36 million, redundancy costs of 28 million net of post-employment curtailments, 5 million and other reorganisation costs of 13 million.
An analysis by segment and description of the charges is set out below: 2005 2004 Asset Reorganisation impairments Redundancy costs Total Total m m m m m Driveline 10 25 11 46 36 Powder Metallurgy 26 1 1 28 44 OffHighway 112 6 Aerospace 11 Corporate 1 1 3 36 28 13 77 100 Restructuring charges in Driveline in 2005 arise as a consequence of the announced closures of three manufacturing plants, two in North America and one in Western Europe, and the continued reduction in the level of xed cost headcount in plants primarily in the Driveline European operations.
The costs charged as incurred or provided for in operating profit and separately identied as restructuring costs include the costs of committed and contractual severance and other employee related exit benets: post-employment augmentations and curtailments, provisions in respect of onerous lease, property and other contracts, asset impairment charges in respect of plant and machinery not transferable to other facilities, the write-down of surplus properties to their estimated realisable value and impairment of dedicated consumable inventories.
Incremental costs borne by the Group as a consequence of dedicated restructuring and transition teams is also charged to restructuring.
In addition, in respect of the closure of the Driveline Western European facility, the costs incurred by the Group in the period from announcement to formal agreement of the Social Plan have been treated as directly attributable to the restructuring as the workforce effectively withdrew their labour whilst on full pay resulting in the immediate curtailment of production.
Customer demand in the period was satisfied by other production facilities.
GKN plc 49 Annual Report 2005 Powder Metallurgy charges arise as a consequence of the Board approved closure of five plants.
These actions remain broadly in line with the original plans though do include an extension to the original scale and constitution of the programme.
Charges comprise property and plant and equipment impairments of 26 million and the cost of redundancies where irrevocable external announcements had been made by 31 December 2005 and actions had commenced.
OffHighway charges spent and provided represent plant closure and facility rationalisation costs, including onerous property lease costs.
Corporate charges relate to the cost of rebasing central overheads and relate primarily to the reduction in headcount which gave rise to redundancy and pension augmentation charges.
Cash outow in 2005 in respect of the 2005 and earlier years restructuring actions amounts to 37 million 2004 21 million.
Of this amount 1 million 2004 5 million relates to the remaining spend on restructuring programmes commenced in earlier years and disclosed as exceptional items under UK GAAP.
2004 restructuring charges comprise asset impairments 63 million : redundancy charges 23 million and reorganisation costs 14 million.
The analysis of 2004 restructuring by segment is set out in note 2.
Other impairments In addition to impairment charges borne as a consequence of strategic reorganisation activities, a 21 million impairment charge has arisen in 2005 relating to the write-down of goodwill, property, plant and equipment at two automotive businesses where, as a consequence of current and future trading performance and projections, sufficient doubt exists over the recoverability of the assets.
The impairment reviews were carried out with reference to both value in use and fair value recoverabilities.
Further details regarding the goodwill impairment of 11 million is given in note 11.
The remaining 10 million impairment to property, plant and equipment relates to a UK business within the Other Automotive segment where, during 2005, a decision was made to transfer certain production to a new Chinese facility.
This fact and continued declining profitability has led to the significant impairment charge.
In 2004, Other impairment charges were recognised in respect of the Powder Metallurgy business amounting to 162 million as a consequence of the annual impairment review.

The primary 2004 transaction relates to the OffHighway disposal of its TCD Tube Connecting business to Eaton Corporation.
2004 transactions generated cash proceeds of 29 million.
d Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments IAS 39, which has been adopted for the first time from 1 January 2005, requires derivative financial instruments to be valued at the date of the balance sheet and any difference between that value and the intrinsic value of the instrument to be reected in the balance sheet as an asset or liability.
Any subsequent change in value is reected in the income statement unless hedge accounting is achieved.
Such movements do not affect cash ow or the economic substance of the underlying transaction and the Group has not attempted to achieve transactional hedge accounting in 2005.
As a consequence, and to assist year-onyear comparison, the change in value has been identied as a separate element of operating profit.
Details of the charges and credits to 2005 operating profit are set out in note 24.
Comparative information has not been presented in accordance with the IFRS 1 exemption governing restatement of comparative information on the adoption of IAS 39.

6 Discontinued operations There were no discontinued operations in the year.
In 2004, discontinued operations comprised the withdrawal from the Groups equity accounted joint venture activities in Aerospace following the sale of its 50% stakes in AgustaWestland NV and Aerosystems International Limited in November 2004 and August 2004, respectively.
The Groups share of the post-tax earnings of these businesses to the date of disposal was 62 million being net of 24 million tax.
The post-tax profit recognised on disposal was 825 million which attracted no tax and is shown in the table below.
2005 2004 m m Sale of AgustaWestland NV 814 Sale of Aerosystems International Limited 11 825 7 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period, excluding Ordinary Shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
The Company has only one category of dilutive potential Ordinary Shares: share options.
The calculation is performed for the share options to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average market share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

The amount outstanding to key management at 31 December 2005 in respect of annual short-term variable remuneration was 1 million 2004 1 million.
Post-employment benets represent the charge to trading profit under IAS 19 attributable to key management arising in the year and the attributable cost of post-employment medical benets.
Termination benets include redundancy, pension augmentations and ex gratia payments arising in connection with loss of ofce and termination of employment with the Group.
Share-based payments represents the annual charge attributable to key management in respect of their participation in the Groups share-based remuneration arrangements: details of the nature of these arrangements are set out in note 10 and in the remuneration report.

10 Share-based payments The Group has granted options over shares to employees for a number of years under different schemes.
Where grants were made after 7 November 2002 they have been accounted for as required by IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
As permitted by the transitional arrangements of that standard, awards made before that date have not been so accounted.
All options have been valued at the date of grant by an independent third party using a Monte Carlo model which uses the same principle as a binomial model.
Details of awards made since 7 November 2002 are: a Employee Sharesave Scheme In September 2003 the Company awarded options to UK employees under an approved Sharesave scheme the terms of which were that the employee entered into regular savings commitment up to a maximum of 250 per month for a three year period.
The cumulative savings were then used to acquire options over a number of shares at a 10% discount to market price at the date of grant.
There were no performance conditions but, in general, the employee must remain in employment for the three year period.
Inputs to the valuation model were: option price 229p, volatility 38%, expected dividend yield 4.3%, risk free interest rate 4.49%, and a term of 3.25 years.
b Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS Awards were made to Directors and certain senior employees in March 2003 under the 2001 scheme and in September 2004 and April 2005 under the 2004 scheme.
Under both schemes options were granted with a xed exercise price equal to the market price at the date of grant and subject to meeting performance conditions over a three year period.
In the case of the 2001 scheme, the performance condition was based on earnings per share EPS growth whilst under the 2004 scheme the condition is based on total shareholder return TSR compared with that of comparator companies.
Under the 2001 scheme only, where the performance condition is not satisfied in full after the first three years, retesting is carried out each year up to six years from the date of grant.
Inputs to the valuation model were: option price 163p to 256.9p, volatility 34% to 38%, expected dividend yield 4.6% to 6.2%, risk free interest rate 4.28% to 4.92% and expected terms of 6.4 years to 6.7 years.
The EPS target for the 2003 award was not achieved and, as a consequence, the provision of 2 million in respect thereof at 31 December 2004 was released to trading profit in 2005. c Long Term Incentive Plans LTIP Awards were made to Directors and certain senior employees in March 2003 under the 2001 scheme and in September 2004 under the 2004 scheme.
In April 2005 awards were made to Directors under the 2004 scheme.
Under both schemes, options were granted subject to TSR performance over a three year period compared with a comparator group.
There is no retest facility under either scheme.
Inputs to the valuation model were: option price nil, volatility 34% to 39%, expected dividend yield 4.6% to 6.2%, risk free interest rate 4.05% to 4.92% and a term of 3 years to 4 years 9.5 months.
Further details of both ESOS and LTIP schemes are given in the remuneration report on pages 96 and 97.
GKN plc 55 Annual Report 2005 d Bonus Co-Investment Plan Under the Bonus Co-Investment Plan, certain senior employees excluding Directors are entitled to use up to 10% of their gross short-term annual bonus potential to purchase shares in the Company at market price.
Provided they remain in employment for three years and the shares are retained for that period, the Company matches those shares.
For shares purchased by employees in 2004 the match was on a two for one basis and in 2005 was two and a half for one.
In addition, in 2005 there is a further one for one match if certain profit targets are achieved.
All shares under the scheme are purchased in the open market.
Inputs to the valuation model were: option price nil, volatility, where applicable, 37%, expected dividend yield 4.9% to 5.4%, risk free interest rate, where applicable, 4.94% and a term of 3 years.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over a period commensurate with the term of the awards.
The risk free interest rate is the rate obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.

Impairment During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment.
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or cash generating unit CGU to their recoverable amount.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
Following the impairment tests, a goodwill impairment of 11 million was recognised within operating profit.
This charge related to part of the Driveline business in the Asia Pacic region supplying a specic customer, where forecast performance is projected to be lower than previously expected.
The pre-tax discount rate used for this CGU was 8.5%.
The 2004 goodwill impairment related to the North American Powder Metallurgy business where planned recovery had been delayed by high material prices and weak markets for the business major customers.
For the purposes of carrying out impairment tests, total Group goodwill has been allocated to a number of CGUs and each of these CGUs has been separately tested.
The allocation of goodwill by business segment is set out in note 2.
The size of a CGU varies but is never larger than a primary or secondary reportable segment.
In many cases, the CGU is an individual subsidiary or operation.
The only amount of goodwill allocated to an individual CGU which is significant to total Group goodwill relates to goodwill, attributable to a US Aerospace business, of 78 million.
All of the recoverable amounts were measured based on value in use except for current year acquisitions, where market values have been used.
Detailed forecasts for the next five years have been used in the impairment tests.
These are based on approved budgets and represent a best estimate of future performance.
A number of key assumptions have been made as a basis for the impairment tests.
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external sources of information and these are set out below.
Where a reasonably possible change to an assumption would lead to an impairment, a sensitivity analysis has been provided which quanties the amount of change required for an impairment to result.
GKN plc 57 Annual Report 2005 Total Group Discount rates A relative risk adjustment or beta has been applied to discount rates to reect the risk inherent in specic CGUs.
In determining the risk adjusted discount rate, management have applied an adjustment for risk of such companies relative to all other sectors on average determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed companies.
Except for operations in Brazil and India, where rates of 22% and 14% respectively have been used, the following risk adjusted pre-tax discount rates have been used for impairment testing: Driveline 8.5-11.5% Powder Metallurgy 11.0% OffHighway 9.5% Aerospace 11.0% Long-term growth rates To forecast beyond the five years covered by detailed forecasts, a long-term average growth rate has been used.
In each case, this is equal to the published International Monetary Fund average growth rate in gross domestic product for the most recent ten year period in the territory where the CGU is primarily based.
This results in a range of growth rates from 1.1% for Japan, to 6.0% for India, with most countries between 2.0% and 3.0%.
Driveline In determining the recoverable amount of Driveline CGUs, it has been necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate future cash ows.
The main assumptions include discount rates, long-term growth rates, future sales prices and volumes with reference to specic customer relationships and product lines, a realistic estimate of new business, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise benets from annual productivity improvements.
Assumptions have also been made regarding input costs, including steel prices.
It is not considered that a reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would generate a different impairment test outcome to the one included in this annual report except for the Asia Pacic business, which has been impaired in the current year.
Here, because of the nature of the relationship with the customer and resulting interdependencies of the key operational assumptions, it is not possible to give meaningful sensitivity analysis.
However, a 1% increase in the discount rate would lead to an additional impairment of 3 million.
For this CGU, the goodwill allocated to it for impairment testing was 24 million of which 11 million has been impaired.
The maximum further goodwill impairment therefore which would result if the above key assumptions were to change is 13 million.
Aerospace In addition to the discount rate and long-term growth rate, the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of Aerospace CGUs were specic volumes on certain US military programmes, the achievement of forecast selling prices, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise planned productivity improvements.
Whilst management are confident that their assumptions are appropriate, it is possible that there would be an impairment were there to be a change in the discount rate, and this is reasonably possible.
In respect of the significant goodwill allocated to one CGU a discount rate of 11% has been used and a 1% increase in this rate would remove the existing valuation headroom and each subsequent 1% increase leading to an approximate additional 12 million of impairment.
Other segments For the remaining impairment tests, key assumptions related to sales volumes and prices, raw material input costs and achieving benets from annual productivity improvements.

This corporation operates under a proxy agreement with the United States Department of Defense developing high technology, classied products for the Joint Strike Fighter.
The agreement currently places significant restrictions on the Groups management and control of the business for the life of the contract so that, in accordance with IAS 27 it has been excluded from the consolidation and treated as an investment.
The amount of the investment has been fully provided.
At 31 December 2005, the excluded net liabilities were 3 million 2004 2 million and the operating loss for the year then ended was 1 million 2004 1 million.

At the 31 December 2005 transfer of effective control had not taken place as formal approval from the Chinese and Taiwanese authorities was awaited.
The Chinese authorities approved the transaction on 23 February 2006 and the Taiwanese authorities are scheduled to meet to consider the transaction on 2 March 2006.
This disposal is expected to take place before the end of March 2006.
The consideration receivable in respect of this transaction will be sufficient to cover the carrying value of the assets net of liabilities being disposed, hence no impairment charge has been recognised on classication of these assets and liabilities as held for sale.
At 31 December 2005 two properties with a combined carrying value of less than 1 million were being actively marketed for disposal at values in excess of their carrying value.
It is expected that the disposal of these properties will take place within 12 months.

For bank and other loans, carrying xed rates of interest, included within long-term borrowings, the repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at the relevant interest rates applicable at 31 December 2005.
Bonds included within long-term borrowings have been valued using quoted closing market values.
23 Financial risk management The Groups multi-national operations and debt nancing expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, foreign exchange rates, credit risks, liquidity and interest rates.
The Group has in place risk management policies that seek to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using various instruments and techniques including foreign currency financial instruments, debt and other interest rate derivatives.
Risk management policies have been set by the Board and applied by the Group and are implemented by the central treasury function that receives regular reports from all the operating companies to enable prompt identication of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
The treasury function has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specic guidelines to manage foreign exchange risks, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments to manage these.
a Foreign exchange risk The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries functional currency.
Under the Groups foreign exchange policy, such transaction exposures are hedged once they are known, mainly through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The mark to market maturity prole of forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2005 is amounts arising within one year 5 million, amounts arising between one and five years 9 million and amounts arising after five years 1 million.
The Group has a significant investment in overseas operations, particularly in continental Europe and the Americas.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Group therefore seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies, except where significant adverse interest differentials or other factors would render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing either directly in either the local domestic or euro-currency markets or indirectly through the use of rolling annual forward foreign exchange contracts.
Borrowings created through the use of such contracts amounted to 631 million at 31 December 2005.
66 GKN plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Financial risk management continued b Interest rate risk The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
This policy is achieved by maintaining a target range of xed and oating rate debt for discrete annual periods, over a dened time horizon.
This is achieved partly through the xed rate character of the underlying debt instrument, and partly through the use of straightforward derivatives forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps and swaptions.
The Groups normal policy is to require interest rates to be xed for 30% to 70% of the level of underlying borrowings forecast to arise over a 12 month horizon.
However, this policy was suspended in December 2004 as it was deemed inappropriate given the absence of oating rate bank debt following the receipt of the sale proceeds of GKNs share in AgustaWestland.
At 31 December 2005 89% of the Groups gross borrowings were subject to xed interest rates.
The Group is partly funded by xed rate borrowings 708 million that are exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
As at 31 December 2005 576 million was on deposit with various banks and in money market funds of which 542 million was on deposit in the UK.
A 1% change in interest rates would have a 5 million impact on profit before tax.
c Credit risk Financial The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Groups policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment graded long-term credit rating, normally at least AA or equivalent, and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits is 100 million, whilst the maximum mark to market exposure for forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2005 to a single bank was 2 million.
Operational As tier one suppliers to both automotive and aerospace manufacturers the Group may have substantial amounts outstanding with a single customer at any one time.
There are many advantages in these relationships and the credit risk is managed at a number of levels.
Debtor days and overdue accounts are reported to divisional management who co-ordinate any action required and overall divisional performance is regularly reviewed by the Group Executive Committee.
As at 31 December 2005 no individual outstanding balance exceeded 1% of sales.
d Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains committed facilities that are designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and planned expansions.
During the year, the Group entered into new facilities of 350 million expiring in July 2010 of which 350 million remained undrawn at the year end.

Also included within the retained earnings balance at 1 January 2004 is goodwill written off directly to equity and accumulated net currency variations on overseas net assets and hedging instruments under legacy GAAP and the impact of the adoption of IFRS note 37.
Other reserves include the UK GAAP revaluation reserve, accumulated adjustments in respect of piecemeal acquisitions and other accumulated reserves where distribution has been restricted due to legal or scal requirements.
The accumulated debit balance as at 1 January 2004 arises as a consequence of the demerger transaction of Industrial Services in 2001.
The hedging reserve and the exchange reserve represent, respectively, the accumulated net currency variations on hedging instruments and equity shareholders interest in overseas net assets.
GKN plc 71 Annual Report 2005 29 Acquisitions 2005 Acquisitions During 2005 the Group has executed two acquisitions as detailed below: a Acquisition on 1 February 2005 of the remaining 51% of the equity shares of Velcon SA fide CV, a Driveline CVJ business now called GKN Driveline Celaya in Mexico, for a fair value consideration of 44 million.
b Acquisition on 8 November 2005 of Lakin Manufacturing Corporations QDS Henschen business, assets excluding cash and trade, a business based in the United States of America engaged in the design and manufacture of hubs, spindles and axles primarily for off-highway applications, for a fair value consideration of 6 million.

No significant value was deemed attributable to these intangibles primarily as their value was contingent on access to existing GKN technology.
Those recognised, which were lower than 1 million, were based on external market data.
Fair value adjustments on tangible xed assets include revaluation of property based on an external third party valuation and reappraisal of plant and machinery using depreciated replacement cost methodology.
Inventories acquired have been fair valued either based on current replacement cost in respect of raw materials or selling price adjusted for costs of disposal and a selling price margin for nished goods and work in progress.
Post-employment obligations were valued in accordance with IAS 19, though the amount recognised was less than 1 million.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of the remaining 51% stake represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired to acquire full control over a significant geographically located manufacturing presence vital to the execution of Drivelines manufacturing footprint changes.
The fair value adjustment to the carrying value of the Groups joint venture 49% investment in Velcon SA fide CV 3 million has been charged to equity as a matter of accounting policy.
In the period post the acquisition Velcon SA fide CV has contributed sales amounting to 53 million and trading profit of 9 million.
The net outow of cash and cash equivalents on the acquisition of the 51% stake in Velcon SA fide CV was 35 million being the cash consideration of 44 million net of cash acquired 9 million.
72 GKN plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the financial statements continued 29 Acquisitions continued Other acquisition m Fair value of net assets acquired 3 Goodwill arising on acquisition 3 Cash consideration including directly attributable expenses 6 The book value of net assets acquired prior to the acquisition amounted to 3 million.
The provisional fair value of net assets acquired primarily represents plant and equipment, inventory and intangible assets customer contracts, order backlog and brand name.
The goodwill arising represents the value of synergies attributable to the combination.
Fair values remain provisional and will be nalised in the 2006 annual accounts once the fair value assessment exercise is nalised.
The post-acquisition contribution towards to Group sales and trading profit was not material.
During the year the Group acquired the remaining minority interest in GKN Driveline Torque Technology KK under court sanction.
The resultant credit has been taken to equity.
The estimated impact on the 2005 Group results of current year acquisitions if they had taken place on 1 January 2005 would not have been material.

A number of retirement plans are operated which provide certain employees with post-employment healthcare benets.
Pensions In the UK, pension arrangements are made through an externally funded dened benefit scheme.
In the United States of America and the Rest of the World there are a number of externally funded dened benefit schemes while in certain companies in Europe funds are retained within the business to provide for post-employment obligations.
a Dened benefit schemes Independent actuarial valuations of all dened benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out at 31 December 2005.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation, the related current service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
Key assumptions were: UK Americas Europe ROW %%%% 2005 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.3 3.5 2.5 2.0 Rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions 2.9 2.0 1.5 n a Discount rate 4.75 5.50 4.25 2.25 Ination assumption 2.8 2.5 1.5 1.0 Rate of increase in medical costs: initial long-term 9.5 4.3 10.0 5.0 n a n a 2004 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.3 3.5 3.0 2.0 Rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions 2.9 2.5 1.5 n a Discount rate 5.30 5.80 4.90 2.30 Ination assumption 2.8 2.5 1.5 1.0 Rate of increase in medical costs: initial long-term 9.5 4.3 10.0 5.0 n a n a The underlying mortality assumptions for the major schemes are as follows: United Kingdom The key current year mortality assumptions for the scheme are that a male aged 65 lives for a further 18 years, whilst a male aged 40 is expected to live a further 19.5 years after retiring at age 65.
These assumptions are based on specic scheme experience, which has been subject to review by the Continuous Mortality Investigative Board, rather than by reference to general UK mortality tables.
Overseas In the USA, RP-2000 tables scaled to 2006 were adopted in the year, whilst there was also a change in Germany where the RT2005-G tables were adopted.

The 5 million curtailment credit included within restructuring and impairment charges arises from the announced closure of Driveline facilities as disclosed in note 3 b.
The 3 million curtailment credit included in Trading profit arises from structural changes to retiree medical benefit arrangements in the United States of America.
A 1% increase in the assumption on medical costs would increase the total service cost and interest cost by 1 million and the liability by 13 million.
A 1% decrease in the assumption would reduce the total service cost and interest cost by 1 million and the liability by 10 million.
The dened benefit obligation is analysed between funded and unfunded schemes as follows: 2005 2004 m m Funded 2,706 2,446 Unfunded 298 269 3,004 2,715 The amounts recognised in respect of funded obligations in the balance sheet are: 31 December 2005 31 December UK Americas Europe ROW Total 2004 m m m m m m Present value of funded obligations 2,364 308 14 20 2,706 2,446 Fair value of plan assets 1,915 170 20 14 2,119 1,861 Net obligation recognised in the balance sheet 449 138 6 6 587 585 The contribution expected to be paid by the Group during 2006 to the UK scheme is 213 million and to overseas schemes 27 million.

78 GKN plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the financial statements continued 37 Explanation of transition to IFRS This is the first year that the Group has presented its consolidated results under IFRS.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The date of transition to IFRS was 1 January 2004.
Set out below are the overall IFRS transition reconciliations which reconcile profit after taxation for the full year 2004 and the net asset positions as at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 between UK GAAP as reported and IFRS.
The information presented in this note has not been audited.
The information presented in this note is consistent with that disclosed in April 2005 when the Group initially published its Restatement of 2004 Financial Information for the impact of IFRS, apart from a minor change in respect of deferred taxation as at 1 January 2004.
