43 Legal proceedings Proceedings, including a class action, have been brought in the United States against a number of defendants, including Barclays, following the collapse of Enron.
In each case the claims are against groups of defendants.
Barclays considers that the claims against it are without merit and is defending them vigorously.
The trial of the class action claims relating to Enron is currently scheduled to begin in October 2006.
A court-ordered mediation commenced in September 2003 but no material progress has been made towards a resolution of the litigation, although certain other defendants have reached settlements.
In addition, in respect of investigations relating to Enron, Barclays is continuing to provide information in response to enquiries by regulatory and governmental authorities in the United States and elsewhere.
It is not possible to estimate Barclays possible loss in relation to these matters, nor the effect that it might have upon operating results in any particular financial period.
Barclays has been in negotiations with the staff of the US Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to a settlement of the Commissions investigation of transactions between Barclays and Enron.
Barclays has also been in negotiations in the Enron bankruptcy proceedings.
Barclays does not expect that the amount of any settlement with the Commission or in the bankruptcy proceedings would have a significant adverse effect on its financial position or operating results.
Barclays is engaged in various other litigation proceedings both in the United Kingdom and a number of overseas jurisdictions, including the 3.5 United States, involving claims by and against it, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
Barclays does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of the proceedings to which Barclays is party to have a significant adverse effect on the financial position of the Group and Barclays has not disclosed the contingent liabilities associated with these claims either because they cannot reasonably be estimated or because such disclosure could be prejudicial to the conduct of the claims.
