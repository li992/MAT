As part of Stephen Burkes compensation for loss of office as disclosed on page 38, awards made to him under the Long Term Incentive Plan vested in the year with the restrictions lifted at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The value of the awards charged to the income statement during the period was 377,900 2004: 187,500 in respect of awards made to the Executive Directors in the year under the Incentive Share Plan.
For full descriptions of the performance and vesting conditions, see Incentive Share Plan for Executive Directors and Senior Employees on page 36.
Deferred Annual Bonus As described on pages 35 and 36, in the event that the Executive Directors bonus entitlement is greater than 100% of salary, the excess above the individuals salary is deferred, invested in the Companys shares and delivered to the individual in three equal tranches on the first three anniversaries of the grant.
In 2006 a total of 1.6m will be awarded to the Executive Directors representing this excess and has been included in the emoluments table for the year as shown on page 37.
There has been no charge made to the income statement in the year for the deferred element of the Annual Bonus Plan.
The charge for the year will be spread over future periods as described in the accounting policies in Note 1 on pages 53 to 57.

The market price of the shares at 31 December 2005 was 270.0p with a range during the year of 175.5p to 278.0p.
Other than those held by Stephen Burke details of which are given on page 41, no options held by Directors lapsed unexercised or were exercised during the period.
Options granted before 2004 are normally exercisable subject to achieving performance criteria at any time on or after the third, but not later than the tenth anniversary of the date on which the option was granted.

Subject to review in each case, the Remuneration Committees general policy is that Executive Directors may accept Non-Executive Directorships with other companies, so long as there is no conflict of interest and their effectiveness is not impaired.
The executive is permitted to retain any fees for the service.
Stephen Puckett received fees of 25,000 2004: 20,833 prorated from his date of appointment as a Non-Executive Director of SHL Group plc.
These fees are not included in the emoluments table on page 37.
Service contracts All Executive Directors service contracts contain a 12 month notice period.
The service contracts also contain restrictive covenants preventing the Directors from competing with the Group for six months following the termination of employment and preventing the Directors from soliciting key employees, clients and candidates of the employing company and Group companies for 12 months following termination of employment.
On termination, any compensation payments due to a Director are calculated in accordance with normal legal principles.
Mitigation of these payments would be applied, depending on the individual circumstances of each case.

Significant accounting policies Statement of compliance The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with current International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, and are covered by IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, because they are the Groups first consolidated IFRS financial statements.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 27.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
Basis of preparation The financial statements of Michael Page International plc consolidate the results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the Company has not been included as part of these accounts.
The Companys profit for the financial year amounted to 11.1m 2004: 12.6m.
The policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.
The Group has made use of the exemption available under IFRS 1 where cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations are deemed to be zero at the date of transition.
The Group has also taken the exemption not to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payment to share options granted before 7 November 2002.
Additionally, as permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has adopted IAS 32 Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation and IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, prospectively from 1 January 2005.
The Groups consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP until 31 December 2004.
UK GAAP differs in some areas from IFRS.
In preparing the 2005 consolidated financial statements, management has amended certain accounting and valuation methods applied in the UK GAAP financial statements to comply with IFRS.
The comparative figures in respect of 2004 were restated to reflect these adjustments as disclosed in the reconciliations, and descriptions of the effect of the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS on the Groups equity and its net income and cash flows are shown in note 27.
The comparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2004, prior to the adjustments required on transition to IFRS as described below and in note 27, have been extracted from the Groups financial statements, a copy of which has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies.
The auditors report on those statements was unqualified and did not include a statement under Section 237 2 or 3 of the Companies Act 1985.
The adoption of the above IFRS did not result in substantial changes to the Groups accounting policies under UK GAAP and as set out in the Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004.
In summary: IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements have affected the overall presentation and certain disclosures.
IAS 10 Events After the Balance Sheet Date has the effect of prohibiting the recognition of the final dividend as a liability until shareholder approval has been received.
Under FRS 12 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets, a liability was recognised.
IAS 14 Segment Reporting has no material effect on the Groups policy.
The Group continues to operate in only one business segment being that of recruitment services, and this has been identified as the Groups primary segment.
Geography is the Groups secondary segment.
IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates has no material effect on the Groups policy.
All material Group entities have the same functional currency as their measurement currency.
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures has affected the identification of related parties and some other related-party disclosures.
The adoption of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has resulted in a change in the accounting policy for share-based payments.
Under UK GAAP, the provision of share-based payments to employees did not result in a charge in the income statement.
Under IFRS, the Group charges the cost of share-based payments to the income statement over the vesting period.
The adoption of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IAS 36 Impairment of Assets and IAS 38 Intangible Assets have resulted in a change in the accounting policy for goodwill.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill was amortised on a straight line basis over a period of 20 years and assessed for an indication of impairment at each balance sheet date.
In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3, the Group ceased amortisation of goodwill from 1 January 2005.
Accumulated amortisation as at 31 December 2004 has been eliminated with a corresponding decrease in the cost of goodwill.
From the year ended 31 December 2005 onwards, goodwill is tested annually for impairment, as well as when there are indications of impairment.
The Group has reassessed the useful lives of its intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of IAS 38.
No adjustment resulted from this reassessment.
5 MICHAEL PAGE INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1.
Significant accounting policies continued The remaining standards are either not applicable to the business or have no material effect on the Groups policies.
Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
All changes in the accounting policies have been made in accordance with the transition provisions in the respective standards.
The revised accounting policies now followed by the Group are shown below: a Turnover and income recognition Turnover, which excludes value added tax VAT, constitutes the value of services undertaken by the Group as its principal activities, which are recruitment consultancy and other ancillary services.
These consist of: turnover from temporary placements, which represents amounts billed for the services of temporary staff including the salary cost of these staff.
This is recognised when the service has been provided: turnover from permanent placements, which is based on a percentage of the candidates remuneration package, and is derived from both retained assignments income recognised on completion of defined stages of work and non-retained assignments income recognised at the date an offer is accepted by a candidate, and where a start date has been determined.
The latter includes turnover anticipated, but not invoiced, at the balance sheet date, which is correspondingly accrued on the balance sheet within prepayments and accrued income.
A provision is made against accrued income for possible cancellations of placements prior to, or shortly after, the commencement of employment: and turnover from amounts billed to clients for expenses incurred on their behalf principally advertisements is recognised when the expense is incurred.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
b Cost of sales Cost of sales consists of the salary cost of temporary staff and costs incurred on behalf of clients, principally advertising costs.
c Gross profit Gross profit is represented by turnover less cost of sales and consists of the total placement fees of permanent candidates, the margin earned on the placement of temporary candidates and the margin on advertising income.
d Foreign currency translation i Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
ii Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Significant accounting policies continued d Foreign currency translation continued iii Group companies The results and financial position of all the group entities none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates: and all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
e Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment see accounting policy h. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
ii Computer software Computer software acquired by the Group is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below.
iii Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Goodwill has an indefinite useful life.
Computer software is amortised at 20% per annum.
The cumulative amount of goodwill written off directly to retained earnings in respect of acquisitions prior to 31 December 1997 is 311.7m 2004: 311.7m.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life at the following rates: Leasehold improvements 10% per annum or period of lease if shorter Furniture, fixtures and equipment 10-20% per annum Motor vehicles 25% per annum g Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
h Impairment of assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
i Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at cost less impairment losses.
j Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
55 MICHAEL PAGE INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1.
Significant accounting policies continued j Taxation continued Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
k Pension costs The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The pension costs charged to the income statement represent the contributions payable by the Group to the funds during each period.
l Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged to profit or loss.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classed as operating leases.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
m Segment reporting The consolidated entity operates in one business segment being that of recruitment services primary segment.
As a result no additional business segment information is required to be provided.
The consolidated entity operates in four geographic segments secondary segment, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas.
n Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
o Share-based compensation The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
Their subsequent accounting treatments are described below: i Share option schemes The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any nonmarket vesting conditions for example, earnings per share.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, the estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable is revised.
The Group recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and the corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
Significant accounting policies continued o Share-based compensation continued ii Deferred Annual Bonus and Long Term Incentive Plans Where deferred awards are made to directors and senior executives under either the Incentive Share Plan or the Annual Bonus Scheme, to reflect that the awards are for services over a longer period, the value of the expected award is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period to which the award relates.
p Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
q Repurchase of share capital When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including any directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
r Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
s Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
t Borrowing costs All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
u Financial instruments The Group has no derivative contracts and therefore the requirements of the recognition criteria under IAS 39 are not relevant to the Group.
v Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Companys accounting policies.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Management anticipate that any estimates and judgements made do not have a material effect on the results.
5 MICHAEL PAGE INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS.
Segment reporting Business is the Groups primary segment.
The consolidated entity operates in one business segment being that of recruitment services.
As a result, no additional business segment information is required to be provided.
The Groups secondary segment is geography.
The analysis below is of the carrying amount of segment assets, segment liabilities and capital expenditure.
Segment assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
The individual geographic segments exclude income tax assets and liabilities.

Taxation on profits on ordinary activities The charge for taxation is based on the annual tax rate of 25.0% on profit before tax 2004: 34.8% before exceptional items.
The exceptional item referred to in the prior year comparatives relates to a tax deduction received as a result of the vesting of the Restricted Share Scheme in April 2004.
This deduction for income tax purposes arose in various tax jurisdictions and resulted in a non-operational exceptional credit of 9.0m to the income tax charge.

Current tax assets and liabilities The current tax asset of 0.4m 2004: 1.2m, and current tax liability of 10.2m 2004: 1.5m represent the amount of income taxes recoverable and payable in respect of current and prior periods.. Dividends 2005 2004 000 000 Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year: Final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 2.75p per ordinary share 2003: 2.3p 9,444 8,248 Interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2005 of 1.5p per ordinary share 2004: 1.25p 4,988 4,345 14,432 12,593 Amounts proposed as distributions to equity holders in the year: Proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2005 of 3.5p per ordinary share 2004: 2.75p 11,497 9,444 The proposed final dividend had not been approved by shareholders at 31 December 2005 and therefore has not been included as a liability.
The comparative final dividend at 31 December 2004 was also not recognised as a liability in the prior year comparatives.
A final dividend of 3.5p 2004: 2.75p per ordinary share will be paid on 5 June 2006 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 5 May 2006.
When the Company pays a dividend to shareholders, there may be income tax consequences.
The impact will depend upon the individual circumstances of the shareholder.. Earnings per ordinary share The calculation of the basic, diluted and adjusted earnings per share is based on the following data: Earnings 2005 2004 Earnings after exceptional tax items for basic earnings per share 000 49,630 34,336 Exceptional tax items 000 9,000 Earnings before exceptional tax items for adjusted earnings per share 000 49,630 25,336 Number of shares Weighted average number of shares used for basic and adjusted earnings per share 000 336,283 351,555 Dilution effect of share plans 000 9,014 3,744 Diluted weighted average number of shares used for diluted earnings per share 000 345,297 355,299 Basic earnings per share pence 14.8 9.8 Diluted earnings per share pence 14.4 9.7 Adjusted earnings per share pence 14.8 7.2 The above results relate to continuing operations.
Earnings per ordinary share continued Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the company and held in the EBT reserve or as treasury shares.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
This calculation determines the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average market price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated in the basic earnings per share is then adjusted to reflect the number of shares deemed to be issued for nil consideration as a result of the potential exercise of existing share options.
The remaining share options that are currently not dilutive and hence excluded from the dilutive earnings per share calculation remain potentially dilutive until they are either exercised or they lapse.
Adjusted Adjusted earnings per share is calculated as for basic earnings per share with the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company adjusted to be stated before exceptional items.
Potential future ordinary share transactions It remains the Companys intention to use surplus cash to repurchase and cancel its shares.

2005 2004 000 000 UK 1,274 1,274 USA 214 214 Singapore 51 51 1,539 1,539 In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are calculated by preparing cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budget and an assumed growth rate of 3%, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the relevant markets.
The terminal value of the cash flow is then calculated by discounting using the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
It is the opinion of the Directors that at 31 December 2005 there was no impairment of intangible assets.

The Group expects to utilise the provision over the next 2 years.
The provision in the prior year also included National Insurance and social security liabilities on the Restricted Share Scheme.
These liabilities crystalised in April 2004 when the Restricted Shares vested.
Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group, and the movements thereon, during the current and prior reporting periods.

Deferred tax continued At 31 December 2005, unremitted earnings of overseas Group companies amounted to 17.6m 2004: 14.0m.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to some overseas and UK tax after allowing for double taxation relief if they were to be distributed as dividends.
However no tax is expected to be payable on them.
Certain of the Groups overseas operations have current and prior year tax losses, the future utilisation of which is uncertain.
Accordingly the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 0.5m 2004: 5.3m in respect of tax losses of overseas companies.
These tax losses are available to offset future taxable profits in the respective jurisdictions.

In accordance with these programmes, options are exercisable at the market price of the shares at the date of the grant.
Two grants under the ESOS were made before 7 November 2002.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have been applied to all grants after 7 November 2002.
They have not been applied to the two grants made prior to 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.
At 31 December 2005 the following options had been granted and remained outstanding in respect of the Companys ordinary shares of 1p under the Michael Page Executive Share Option Scheme.
All options granted are settled by the physical delivery of shares.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
Called-up share capital continued In 2005, options were granted on 28 February with the estimated fair values of the options granted on that day of 1.7m.
In 2004, options were granted on 1 March.
The estimated fair values of the options granted on that date was 1.5m.
Share options are granted under service and non-market performance conditions.
These conditions are not taken into account in the fair value measurement at grant date.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants other than those on the initial grant in 2001.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2005 have an exercise price in the range of 81.5 pence to 190.75 pence and a weighted average contractual life of 6.2 years.
The fair values of options granted during the year were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs into the model were as follows: Share Option Scheme Incentive Share Scheme Deferred Bonus Shares 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 Share price 1.91 1.71 1.93 1.71 1.93 Average exercise price 1.91 1.72 Nil Nil Nil Expected volatility 35% 35% 35% 35% 35% Expected life 5 years 5 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Risk free rate 4.75% 4.75% 4.75% 4.75% 4.75% Expected dividend yield 2% 2% Nil Nil Nil Expected volatility was determined by reference to historical volatility of the Companys share price since flotation.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The Group recognised total expenses of 2.7m 2004: 1.2m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.
Option plan details Note 1 Pre flotation options On flotation, options over 33,750,000 9% ordinary shares were granted to the Executive Directors and 427 employees.
These options are subject to the following: a 55.6% of an individuals option entitlement will normally only be exercisable to the extent that Earnings Per Share EPS targets have been satisfied over a period of 3 to 10 years.
None of these options will vest unless EPS has grown in line with the UK Retail Prices Index RPI plus an average of 5% per annum.
At that point one third of this portion of the options vest.
If EPS growth is higher than this level, vesting increases on a sliding scale basis until 100% of this portion of the options vest where EPS growth matches RPI plus an average of 10% per annum.
The base earnings per share is 9.9p.
The results for the year ended 31 December 2005 have met the EPS performance conditions for 85% of the outstanding options which will vest on 1 March 2006. b 44.4% of an individuals option entitlement will normally only be exercisable to the extent that share price growth targets have been satisfied over a period of at least 3 years.
None of these options will vest unless the Companys share price has achieved 50% growth after 3 years and not later than 5 years.
Vesting then increases progressively for further share price growth until full vesting occurs where there is 200% growth after 3 years and not later than 5 years.
These hurdles rise from the fifth anniversary of the date of grant at compound rates of growth of 8.45% and 24.57% respectively.
At 31 December 2005, the performance conditions were met for 33.7% of the outstanding share price dependent options and these vested on 31 December 2005.
Note 2 2002 Grant On 14 March 2002, options over 7,500,000 ordinary shares were granted in two tranches to the Executive Directors and 203 employees at an exercise price of 186p.
The first tranche of options is exercisable, under normal circumstances, between 3 and 10 years from the date of grant.
The second tranche is exercisable, under normal circumstances, between 4 and 10 years from the date of grant.
These options were granted subject to a performance condition requiring that an option may only be exercised, in normal circumstances, if there has been an increase in base earnings per share of at least 3% per annum above the growth in the retail price index.
The 2001 earnings per share of 10.6p is the base for the first tranche of options.
The 2002 earnings per share of 5.8p is the base for the second tranche of options.
The results for the year ended 31 December 2005 have met the performance conditions for both tranches, 100% of which will vest on 1 March 2006 and 14 March 2006 respectively.
Called-up share capital continued Note 3 2003 Grant On 8 April 2003, options over 7,140,000 were granted to the Executive Directors and 110 employees at exercise prices of between 81.5p and 86.1p.
These are exercisable, under normal circumstances, between 3 and 10 years from the date of grant.
These grants are subject to a performance condition requiring that an option may only be exercised, under normal circumstances, if there has been an increase in base earnings per share of at least 3% per annum above the growth in the retail price index.
The base earnings per share is 5.8p.
The results for the year ended 31 December 2005 have met these performance conditions and therefore 100% of these options will vest on 8 April 2006.
Note 4 2004 Grant On 1 March 2004, options over 2,711,000 were granted to the Executive Directors and 99 employees at an exercise price of between 171p-190.3p.
The performance condition is tested on the third anniversary only and no retesting will occur thereafter.
The base earnings per share is 4.1p.
Note 5 2005 Grant On 28 February 2005, options over 2,770,000 were granted to the Executive Directors and 133 employees at an exercise price of between 190.75p and 191.5p.
Base earnings per share is 7.5p after adjusting for share scheme charges.
All future grants of options under this scheme will be subject to similar EPS performance conditions which is considered the best measure of the Groups performance and is designed to provide a direct link between the rewards for executives and the returns to shareholders, whilst at the same time ensuring that senior executives can measure the results of their efforts through the Companys share price.
Other share-based payment plans The Company also operates an Incentive Share Plan for the Executive Directors and Senior Employees and an Annual Bonus Plan for the Executive Directors.
Details of these schemes are disclosed on pages 35 and 36, and are settled by the physical delivery of shares to the extent that service and performance conditions are met.
Reserves Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve relates to the cancellation of the Companys own shares.
The increase in the year represents the nominal value of the 24,565,000 shares cancelled during the year as shown in Note 18.
EBT reserve At 31 December 2005, the EBT reserve consisted of 5,640,715 2004: 5,640,715 ordinary shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust representing 1.70% of the called-up share capital with a market value of 15.2m 2004: 10.5m.
A total of 1,219,934 shares have been allocated to satisfy awards made under the Incentive Share Plan, and 265,439 deferred shares have been allocated under the Annual Bonus Plan.
Dividends are paid on these shares and they are included in the EPS calculation.
Dividend income on the remaining 4,155,342 ordinary shares has been waived, and they are excluded from the EPS calculation.
Treasury shares The reserve for the Companys own shares in the previous year comprised the cost of the Companys shares held by the Group.
During the year to 31 December 2005, all shares held in treasury were cancelled.
At 31 December 2004, the Group held 7,765,000 of the Companys shares in Treasury.

Adoption of IFRS in 005 The accounting policies were changed on 1 January 2005 to comply with IFRS.
The transition from UK GAAP to IFRS is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards with 1 January 2004 as the date of transition.
The changes in accounting policies as a consequence of the transition to IFRS are described below, and the reconciliations of the effects of the transition to IFRS are presented in the notes to the first IFRS financial statements.
The revised accounting policies are described in note 1.
The transition to IFRS resulted in the following changes in accounting policies: Goodwill is not amortised but measured at cost less impairment losses.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill was amortised on a straight-line basis through profit and loss over its estimated useful economic life of 20 years.
The effect of the change is an increase in equity and profit before tax of 96,000 at 31 December 2004.
The change does not affect equity or profit before tax at 1 January 2004.
The change has no tax effect as deferred taxes are not recognised for temporary differences arising from goodwill for which amortisation is not deductible for tax purposes.
Dividends to shareholders declared after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date but are disclosed separately in the notes.
Under UK GAAP dividends for the accounting year were recognised as a liability.
The effect of the change is an increase in equity at 1 January 2004 of 8.2m and 9.5m at 31 December 2004.
Share option costs under UK GAAP were based on the intrinsic value of the option at the date of grant and as such, grants made under the Groups share option plans did not result in a charge to the income statement.
Under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, the Group measures the cost of all share options granted since 7 November 2002 that have not fully vested at the balance sheet date, using an option pricing model.
A liability in respect of social charges has also been recognised in respect of the Groups share option schemes.
Deferred tax relating to the new share option charges described above have been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
Computer software has been reclassified from tangible fixed assets to intangible fixed assets.
Cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations have been deemed to be zero at the date of transition.
After the date of transition, foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of accounts of overseas operations are shown in a currency translation reserve as a separate component of equity.
Adoption of IFRS in 005 continued Reconciliation of Group Profit The adoption of IFRS had the following impact on Group profit.
