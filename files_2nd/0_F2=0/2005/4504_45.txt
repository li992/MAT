28 Derivatives and other financial instruments The narrative disclosures required by FRS 13, Derivatives and Financial Instruments, are set out in this section, within the Accounting Policies and in the Treasury operations, interest charge and exchange paragraphs of the Financial Review on pages 12 and 13.
Numerical disclosures are set out below.
The use of financial instruments to manage interest rate and currency risk is subject to Board approval and will not create additional financial exposures over and above those arising from our normal activity.
Short term debtors and creditors have been omitted from these disclosures as permitted by FRS 13.
Currency analysis of net assets While continuing to focus on the management of cash flow, the Group will, where practicable, seek to limit translation exposures to major currencies by hedging between 75 per cent and 100 per cent of underlying net assets as set out in the Financial Review.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Market values have been used to determine the fair values of the Groups financial assets.
There is no significant difference between book value and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities except as shown in the table of unrecognised gains and losses on hedging instruments below.
Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities With the Group currently holding relatively low levels of debt, and being in a net cash position at year end, decisions on interest rate hedging management for major borrowings will be taken on a case by case basis and subject to Board approval.
The Groups financial liabilities comprise short term borrowings of 17.8m note 15 : long term borrowings of 16.4m note 16 : other long term creditors of 12.8m note 16 and provisions for other liabilities and charges of 25.8m note 17.
Drawings under major committed facilities are at no more than 0.45 per cent above LIBOR.
The Group entered into an interest rate swap in October 2002 to fix the interest rate on US$25m of financial liabilities at 3.00% until September 2005.
As at 26 March 2005, there were no financial liabilities outstanding under this interest rate swap.
The Group intends to maintain significant undrawn available committed facilities.
Borrowings under these facilities at 26 March 2005 and the current facility maturity pattern were as follows: Total facilities Drawings Undrawn m m m Within one year 16.8 3.0 13.8 Between one and two years 13.8 3.1 10.7 Between two and five years 43.4 8.4 35.0 More than five years 1.1 1.1 75.1 15.6 59.5 An analysis of the Groups total financial liabilities maturity profile is set out below: 2005 2004 m m Within one year 39.4 30.5 Between one and two years 13.5 13.8 Between two and five years 17.5 37.4 More than five years 2.4 4.1 72.8 85.8 fide La Rue Annual Report Accounts 59 Notes to the accounts continued 28 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Interest rate risk profile of financial assets The Groups financial assets comprise cash and deposits together with other investments as per note 11.

Hedging future transactions Whenever a Group company transacts in non local currency it is policy to take protection in the foreign exchange market unless it is impracticable or uneconomic to do so.
Transactions undertaken will be accounted for in accordance with IAS39.
The table below shows the extent to which the Group has off-balance sheet unrecognised gains and losses in respect of financial instruments forward foreign currency contracts used as hedges at the beginning and end of the year.
All gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions.
