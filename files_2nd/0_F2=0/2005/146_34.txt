This review has resulted in a transfer of 3,977,000 from goodwill to intangible assets.
The Group used a discounted cash flow approach to calculate the fair value of customer relationships acquired.
The fair values have been used as the acquisition cost for these assets.
The discounted cash flow calculation includes assumptions as to the duration of customer relationships and future net revenues.
The resulting cash flows were discounted using a cost of capital rate of between 8.5% and 10.5%.
Other intangible assets were capitalised at cost.
Amortisation on other intangible assets is included in cost of sales on the income statement.
