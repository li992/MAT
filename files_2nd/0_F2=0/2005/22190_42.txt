All income relating to payment protection insurance is regarded as being part of the groups economic return on the loans.
It is a constituent part of the effective interest rate and included within interest income.
Therefore, payment protection insurance is not treated as an insurance contract in the groups financial statements.

The insurance liabilities for insurance products written prior to 2005 and mechanical breakdown insurance written up to 30 September 2005 have been commuted to a third party insurer during the year and therefore the group is no longer exposed to any insurance risk.
