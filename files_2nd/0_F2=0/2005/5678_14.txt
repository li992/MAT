Goodwill arising in these circumstances is not amortized in the company where the directors are of the view that the goodwill has an indefinite economic life, but is reviewed annually for impairment.
The non-amortization of goodwill represents a departure from the Companies Act 1985 but is necessary to give a true and fair view under the provisions of FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
It is not possible to quantify the impact of this departure, as it would depend on the life adopted.

The assets of the scheme are held independently from the companys finances and are administered by a Trustee company.
Pension costs are assessed on the advice of an independent qualified actuary following triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
This scheme is no longer offered to new employees of the company.
A valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at March 31 2005 and the long-term assumptions having the most significant effect on the pension costs reported under SSAP24 Accounting for Pension Costs are shown in the following table: Price inflation 2.75% p. a.
The surpluses or deficits identified from the valuation of the scheme are amortised over a period of 11 years using the straight line method.
Following the triennial valuation as at March 31 2005, the company cash contribution rate was increased to 18% of pensionable salaries 2004: 15%.
With effect from April 1 2005 a new benefits structure was introduced to include a new Standard section and a Pension section.
In the Standard section, employees pay contributions of 5% of pensionable salaries but accrue future benefits at a lower rate than before.
Under the Pension section, employees currently pay contributions of 6% rising progressively to 7.5% by July 1 2007 and retain existing benefit accrual rates 2004: all employees paid 5%.
A prepayment of 204,000 2004: 186,000 is included in working capital, representing the excess of accumulated contributions paid over the equivalent pension charge.
A provision of 333,000 2004: 329,000 is included in creditors, representing the excess of the accumulated pension charge over pension contributions paid.
The effect of UITF 6 Accounting for Post-Retirement Benefits other than Pensions is not material.
Euromoney Pension Plan The Euromoney Pension Plan is a defined contribution arrangement under which contributions are paid by the employer and employees.
From February 1 2003 this plan was merged with the DMGT Pension Trust, an umbrella trust under which DMGT UK defined contribution plans are held.
Insured death benefits are also held under this trust.
The plan is contracted-in to the State Second Pension and its assets are invested under trust in funds selected by members and held independently from the companys finances.
The investment and administration of the plan is undertaken by Fidelity Pension Management.
Private schemes Institutional Investor, Inc. contributes to a 401 k savings and investment plan for its employees which is administered by an independent investment provider.
Employees are able to contribute up to 15% of salary with the company matching up to 50% of the employee contributions, up to 5% of salary.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits As permitted by the transitional arrangements of FRS 17, the costs, accruals and prepayments recorded in the financial statements continue to be reported in accordance with the requirements of SSAP 24 'Accounting for Pension Costs'.
The company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme since the scheme includes members from other companies within the Daily Mail and General Trust group.
Under FRS 17 the scheme will therefore be accounted for as a defined contribution scheme by the company.
As included in the financial statements of Daily Mail and General Trust plc for the year ended October 2 2005, the latest interim actuarial valuation at October 2 2005 prepared in accordance with FRS 17 showed that the market value of the Schemes assets was 519.2 million and that the actuarial value of these assets represented 82.9% of the benefits that had accrued to members also calculated in accordance with FRS 17.
Full disclosures in relation to the principal schemes are given in the accounts of the Daily Mail and General Trust plc.
The impact of this funding position on the contribution rates for this company is disclosed earlier in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme section of this note.
Stakeholder Pensions The company provides access to a stakeholder pension plan for relevant employees who are not eligible for other pension schemes operated by the group.

Acquisition of new businesses On October 5 2004, the group purchased through one of its subsidiaries, Internet Securities, Inc. ISI, the assets of the Business Intelligence division of Liquid Africa Ltd for a cash consideration of 121,000.
On March 11 2005, the group purchased, through ISI, a 49% interest in the equity share capital of CEIC Holdings Limited for an initial cash consideration together with associated costs of $7,738,000 4,017,000.
The group currently exercises joint control over the business and consequently the investment is accounted for as a joint venture.
A binding contract has also been entered into to acquire a further 25% interest in CEIC in June 2006 and the final 26% a year later.
These further payments are dependant on the audited profits of CEIC for the years to March 31 2006 and 2007 respectively.
The maximum consideration payable for 100% of CEIC is capped at $35 million.
On September 14 2005, the group purchased 40% of the equity share capital of TelCap Limited for an initial cash consideration of 2,080,000.
The group currently exercises significant influence over the business and consequently the investment is accounted for as an associate.
A contract has also been entered into to acquire four further tranches of TelCaps equity of 15% each in March 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively.
These consideration payments are dependant on the audited profits of Telcap for the years to January 31 2007 to 2010.
The maximum consideration payable for 100% of TelCap is capped at 17.5 million.
Increase in equity shareholdings On February 28 2005, the group purchased a further 1.05% of the equity share capital of Internet Securities, Inc. for a cash consideration of 385,000.
Payments of deferred consideration In February 2005, in accordance with the purchase agreement, the group paid the second instalment of $10,065,000 for Information Management Network, Inc. IMN, the 80% owned financial conference organiser purchased in February 2004.
This resulted in the creation of 794,000 additional goodwill.
Further deferred consideration payments under the purchase agreement are payable in February 2006 and 2007 notes 16 and 17.
In addition, goodwill has been further increased by 5,088,000 due to revised estimates on the future profits of the company and hence increases the deferred consideration.

These comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the group which are not denominated in the operating currency of the operating unit involved, but exclude certain non-sterling borrowings which are matched by equivalent group assets or are treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.

These instruments take the form of forward exchange rate contracts to sell US dollars in exchange for sterling to meet the excess of sterling costs over sterling revenues as well as dividend payments by the parent company.
The group also uses interest rate swaps and interest rate cap and collar derivatives to minimize interest rate fluctuations.
Three new interest rate swaps have been entered into amounting to US$10 million, US$15 million and US$15 million each with DMGT group undertakings with effective dates of March 31 2005, September 30 2006 and March 31 2007 respectively.

The directors are of the opinion that based on recent and forecast trading, the level of profits in future years are more likely than not to be sufficient to enable the asset to be recovered.
A deferred tax asset of 5,926,000 has been recognized in respect of overseas tax losses and other short-term timing differences 2004: 1,258,000.
A deferred tax asset of 1,249,000 has not been recognized in respect of overseas tax losses and other timing differences 2004: 6,600,000 as there is insufficient certainty in the current market to be able to say that the group will be more than likely than not to generate sufficient suitable overseas taxable profits.
The group is able to obtain tax relief in the US for the cost of goodwill arising on some of its acquisitions.
In certain cases the goodwill was written off to reserves under the transitional rules set out in FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
Utilization of the available tax relief in the US gives rise to a timing difference as set out above.
The potential timing difference will only reverse on a sale of the relevant businesses.
As the relevant businesses are considered core to the group there is currently no intention to sell them.
The potential reversal is so far into the future that after discounting, the potential liability becomes insignificant.
The effect of discounting the group's other deferred tax assets and liabilities is not material.
