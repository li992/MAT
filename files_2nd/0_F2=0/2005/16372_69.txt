IAS 32 requires preference shares that provide for a xed preference dividend to be classied as borrowings and preference dividends to be recognised in the income statement as a finance cost.
IAS 39 requires unrealised fair value gains losses on certain financial instruments to be recognised in equity: when realised, these fair value gains losses are recognised in the income statement.
In accordance with the transition rules for first time adoption of IFRSs, 2004 comparatives have not been restated.
