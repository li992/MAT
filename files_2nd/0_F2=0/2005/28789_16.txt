As part of these arrangements the Company indemnified the purchaser of CFI against certain ongoing costs being incurred by that company.
The relevant indemnified costs are expected to be incurred between 2005 and 2027 and the indemnity provision has been based on the Companys share of the projected costs.
Investment Provision The Company owns several investments which were acquired under arrangements whereby part of the profit eventually realised on their disposal would be paid to certain third parties.
The provision has been computed by reference to the carrying value of the underlying investments.
Litigation As mentioned in note 28, litigation proceedings are in process against the Company relating to its investment in H-G Holdings Inc. A provision of 1 million has been recognised for the estimated legal costs of defending the action which are likely to be incurred over the next one or two years.

Long-term Incentive Plan This provision represents amounts accrued under a long-term incentive arrangement structured in the form of a Share Appreciation Rights Plan SAR.

RIS and certain connected entities.
The proceedings relate to the Companys investment in H-G Holdings Inc. and a loan made to RIS by the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, Atlantic and General Investment Trust Limited AGIT.
The claim against all of the defendants was for approximately US$240 million.
On 15 March 2002 the New York Court dismissed the proceedings in their entirety at their initial stage for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
On 1 April 2002 the plaintiffs filed an appeal against that dismissal.
On 23 September 2003 the New York Appellate Court affirmed the dismissal of the proceedings as to thirty causes of action included in the claim and as to AGIT.
The New York Appellate Court reinstated three of the causes of action as to seven of the defendants, including the Company, and referred the matter back to the New York Court for further proceedings with respect to those three causes of action.
Based upon legal advice received, the Directors do not believe that the proceedings will have a material effect on the financial position of the Company.
29 PENSION COMMITMENTS Pension Scheme J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited has pension commitments in respect of its participation in the RITCP Scheme.
The Scheme has two parts: a defined benefit section which is closed to new members and money purchase arrangements which have been set up for Lord Rothschild.
The last actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the RITCP Scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2002 and the report was produced using the projected unit method of funding using the following main assumptions: Annual compound rate Investment return 6.50% Rate of increase in salaries 3.50% Rate of increase in payment of all pensions 4.00% Inflation assumption 2.00% Appropriate demographic assumptions have also been used.
At 1 January 2002 the market value of assets of the Scheme was 5.188 million.
Based on the assumptions set out above for determining the Schemes liabilities as at 1 January 2002, the funding level of the Scheme as at this date was 82% allowing for projected future salary increases for current active members.
Following the actuarial valuation the Company agreed to make lump sum contributions to the Scheme totalling 1 million over the period to April 2003.
A current funding level valuation considers whether the assets would have been sufficient at the valuation date to cover liabilities arising in respect of pensions in payment, preserved benefits for members whose pensionable service has ceased and accrued benefits for members in pensionable service, based on pensionable service to, and pensionable earnings at, the date of valuation including revaluation on the statutory basis.
Based on the current funding level methodology and financial assumptions set out above, the funding level of the plan as at 1 January 2002 was 91%, a deficiency of 0.499 million.
This is a measure of solvency that compares the assets of the Scheme with the actuarial value of the liabilities in respect of benefits that would arise if all of the members were to leave the Scheme at the valuation date.
The formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 1 January 2005 is currently being carried out.

An additional contribution of 0.25 million was made in June 2004.
A special contribution of 3.4 million was made in March 2005 to extinguish the deficit in the pension scheme, which otherwise would have been deducted from the Groups net asset value in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 17, Retirement Benefits FRS17.
The funding rate in respect of the money purchase arrangements was 20% of pensionable salary.
No changes have been made to these funding rates to date.
The employer contribution rate to the Scheme during the year ended 31 March 2004 was 35% of pensionable salaries.
An additional contribution of 0.4 million was made in April 2003.
Since the defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants, the service cost as a percentage of pensionable salary, calculated using the projected unit method, would be expected to increase as the current membership approaches retirement.
Financial Reporting Standard 17, Retirement Benefits The Group has adopted FRS17 in full during the year.
The adoption of this standard has resulted in a prior year adjustment as set out in note 22: the adjustment includes the reversal of the provision of 0.3 million made in 2004 in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24, Accounting for Pension Costs, and the related deferred tax of 0.1 million.
In accordance with the requirements of FRS17 this note discloses the main financial assumptions made in valuing the liabilities of the defined benefit scheme and the fair value of the assets held.
The full actuarial valuation of the scheme which was carried out as at 1 January 2002 was updated to 31 March 2005 by a qualified independent actuary.
The main financial assumptions are shown in the following table: At At At 31 March 31 March 31 March 2005 2004 2003 Discount rate 5.40% 5.50% 5.50% Rate of increase in salaries 4.25% 3.25% 3.75% Rate of increase in payment of all pensions 4.00% 4.00% 4.00% Inflation assumption 2.90% 2.75% 2.25% RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Accounts Notes to the Accounts 59 29 PENSION COMMITMENTS CONTINUED The fair value of the assets held by the defined benefit scheme, the long-term expected rate of return on each class of assets and the value of the schemes liabilities assessed on the assumptions described above are shown in the following table: Long-term Long-term Long-term rate of return Value at rate of return Value at rate of return Value at expected at 31 March expected at 31 March expected at 31 March 31 March 2005 31 March 2004 31 March 2003 2005 000 2004 000 2003 000 Equities 9.00% 4,978 8.80% 4,580 7.30% 4,628 Alternative investments 9.00% 2,489 9.00% 1,849 Corporate bonds 5.25% 126 5.50% 118 5.50% 106 Cash 4.00% 3,493 3.50% 343 3.80% 71 Total market value of assets 11,086 6,890 4,805 Present value of the schemes liabilities 10,352 10,263 9,924 Surplus deficit in the scheme 734 3,373 5,119 Related deferred tax liability asset 220 1,012 1,536 Net pension asset liability 514 2,361 3,583 The fair value of the assets of the defined contribution section of the Scheme, representing investments providing money purchase benefits, together with the related liabilities, have both been excluded from the figures disclosed above.
