Notes on the Accounts 1 Accounting policies Accounting convention The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of investment properties and subsidiary undertakings, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and with the Companies Act 1985, except as noted below.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups accounts.
The Group has also implemented the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
Basis of consolidation Except as explained below, the consolidated accounts incorporate the results of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 31st March.
Subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting unless the criteria for merger accounting are met.
In accordance with Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 a separate profit and loss account for the Company is not presented with these accounts.
Investment Division investments that are subsidiary undertakings are carried at cost less amounts, if any, written off to reflect impairment in value, in accordance with the companys normal accounting policy for such investments, and are not consolidated as required by FRS 2 Accounting for Subsidiary Undertakings.
These investments within the Groups portfolio are held for resale with a view to the ultimate realisation of capital gains, although not necessarily with a view to disposal within one year of acquisition.
The Groups exposure to these companies is limited to its investment at the balance sheet date.
Consequently, the directors consider that consolidation would not give a true and fair view of the Groups interest in these investments.
This treatment reflects the application of the true and fair override to FRS 2.
It is not practicable to determine the effects of the application of the true and fair override on the accounts.
Additional information on the subsidiary undertakings not consolidated is given in note 12.
Investment properties In accordance with SSAP 19 Accounting for Investment Properties, investment properties are revalued annually at open market value determined in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors.
Revaluation surpluses and temporary deficits are included in the revaluation reserve, permanent deficits being taken through the profit and loss account.
No depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties and leasehold investment properties with over 20 years to run.
This treatment, which is in accordance with SSAP 19, may be a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act concerning depreciation of fixed assets.
However, these properties are not held for consumption but for investment and the directors consider that systematic annual depreciation would be inappropriate.
The accounting policy adopted is therefore necessary for the accounts to give a true and fair view.
Depreciation or amortisation is only one of many factors reflected in the annual valuation and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identified or quantified.
Investment Division investments Investments are stated at cost less amounts written off to reflect permanent diminution in value.
Those investments that are associated undertakings are carried at cost in accordance with the Groups normal policy and are not equity accounted as required by the Companies Act 1985.
The directors consider that as these investments are held as part of the Groups portfolio with a view to the ultimate realisation of capital gains, equity accounting would not give a true and fair view of the Groups interest in these investments.
It is not practicable to determine the effects of this departure which is in accordance with FRS 9 Associates and Joint Ventures on the accounts.
Other tangible assets These comprise computers, furniture, fixtures and fittings, and improvements to Group occupied properties and are depreciated on a straight-line basis to estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives of between 3 and 5 years.
Goodwill Goodwill, including negative goodwill, arising on acquisition is calculated based upon a comparison of the fair value of the assets acquired and the fair value of the consideration given and other costs of acquisition.
The negative goodwill arising on the acquisition of Inflexion plc has been released to the profit and loss account as the Inflexion plc assets, to which the negative goodwill related, were realised.
Trading properties Trading properties are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Interest and other outgoings on property developments Interest and other outgoings on vacant properties prior to redevelopment are treated as revenue expenditure and written off as incurred.
Interest costs on properties in development are written off as incurred.
Debt instruments and interest rate derivatives Debt instruments are stated at their net proceeds on issue.
Issue costs are amortised to the profit and loss account over the life of the instrument and are included in interest payable.
44 London Merchant Securities plc 1 Accounting policies continued Amounts payable or receivable under interest rate derivatives are matched with the interest payable on the debt which the derivatives hedge.
In the course of the Groups investment and financing activity underlying debt may be retired or redeemed such that an interest rate derivative becomes surplus.
In these circumstances the derivative is marked to market or closed out.
Any deficit surplus arising is charged credited to the profit and loss account and included in net interest payable.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date, and exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account.
The results and balance sheets of overseas operations are translated at the closing rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets are dealt with through reserves.
Investment Division investments denominated in foreign currencies remain at the initial recorded amount and are not retranslated as these balances represent the historical cost of acquiring these investments.
Net rental income Rental income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Rent increases arising from rent reviews are taken into account when such reviews have been settled with tenants.
Operating lease incentives Operating lease incentives include rent free periods and other incentives such as contributions towards fitting out costs given to lessees on entering into lease agreements.
In accordance with UITF Abstract 28 Operating Lease Incentives, rent receivable in the period from lease commencement to the earlier of the first rent review to the prevailing market rate and the lease end date, is spread evenly over that period.
The cost of other incentives is spread on a straight-line basis over a similar period.
Cash and liquid resources Cash, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand.
Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are either readily convertible into known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying values or traded in an active market.
Liquid resources comprise short-term cash deposits.
Pensions Contributions to the Groups pension and life assurance schemes are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
UITF Abstract 17 The Group operates an Inland Revenue approved employee share option scheme and has taken advantage of the exemption given in UITF Abstract 17 Employee Share Schemes from recognising a charge in the profit and loss account for the discount on the options.
Taxation Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
On disposal of an investment property the element of tax relating to the profit in the year is charged to the profit and loss account and the element relating to earlier revaluation surpluses is included in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the accounts and their recognition in a tax computation.
In accordance with FRS 19 Deferred Tax, deferred tax is provided in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date that may give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on the sale has been recognised in the accounts.
Subsidiary undertakings valuation The Companys investments in the shares of Group undertakings are stated at directors valuation on a basis which takes account of the net assets of the undertakings at 31st March 2005 which will include, where applicable, the professional valuation of properties and the carrying value of Investment Division investments.
Surpluses and temporary deficits arising from the directorsvaluation are taken to revaluation reserve in the Company balance sheet, permanent diminutions in value are taken to the Company profit and loss account.

London Merchant Securities plc Notes to the Accounts 47 5 Pension costs The assets of the pension schemes are held separately from those of the Group companies.
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme which is contributory for members, provides benefits based on final pensionable salary and contributions are invested in a Unitised with Profit Policy with Sun Alliance and London Insurance Company Limited plus annuity policies held in the name of the Trustees.
With effect from 6th April 2001 the Company introduced a plan to pay contributions to personal pensions established with a specific provider.
New employees are eligible to join this arrangement: the defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants.
Inflexion plc, the Groups 58.8% owned subsidiary, pays contributions to personal pensions for its employees.
The pension charge for the Group was 1.8 million 2004 2.5 million.
The pension charge for the defined benefit scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
The most important assumptions made in connection with the establishment of this charge were that interest will be earned on the fund at the rate of 5.5% per annum and that salaries will be increased at 4.5% per annum.
The market value of assets of the scheme at 31st March 2005 was 7.4 million and the actuarial value of those assets on an ongoing basis represented 51.7% of the benefit of 14.2 million that had accrued to members allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Net of the related deferred tax asset the pension deficit is 4.8 million.
The employer will pay an enhanced contribution designed to eliminate the underfunding over the next three to five years.
The Company has applied the phased transitional rules under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The additional disclosures required by FRS 17 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuation as at 1st November 2004.
The assumptions used by the actuary for the purposes of the valuation are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale involved, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
2005 2004 2003 % per annum % per annum % per annum Future salary growth 4.5% 4.5% 3.9% Discount rate 5.5% 5.4% 5.4% Rate of increase in pension payments 5.0% 5.0% 5.0% Inflation rate 3.0% 3.0% 2.7% Using the above assumptions and the projected unit method of valuation, the Actuary has arrived at an estimate of the fair value ofthe schemes assets and the present value of its liabilities to produce an overall scheme valuation.
The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short-term, may be subject to significant change before they are realised: the present value of the schemes liabilities, which is derived from cash flow projections over long periods, is inherently uncertain.
The estimates arrived at were: 2005 2004 2003 Long-term rate 2005 Long-term rate of 2004 Long-term rate of 2003 of return expected Value return expected Value return expected Value % per annum m % per annum m % per annum m Assets Equities UK and overseas 7.5 5.5 7.5 2.1 7.5 0.8 Bonds Government and corporate 5.0 1.2 5.0 0.9 5.0 0.8 Property UK 7.0 0.4 7.0 0.2 7.0 0.1 Cash cash and deposits 4.7 0.2 4.5 1.2 4.5 0.1 Unitised with profits 6.6 0.1 6.8 0.2 6.8 7.5 Total market value of assets 7.0 7.4 6.7 4.6 6.7 9.3 Present value of scheme liabilities 14.2 12.9 17.0 Deficit in scheme 6.8 8.3 7.7 Related deferred tax asset 2.0 2.5 2.3 Net pension liability 4.8 5.8 5.4 Equity Shareholders funds 732.1 710.0 678.9 Net pension liability 4.8 5.8 5.4 Equity Shareholders funds including net pension liability 727.3 704.2 673.5 Reserves Profit and loss account excluding net pension liability 233.1 263.2 260.7 Net pension liability 4.8 5.8 5.4 Profit and loss account including net pension liability 228.3 257.4 255.3 48 London Merchant Securities plc Notes to the Accounts 5 Pension costs continued 2005 2004 m m Analysis of the amount that would have been charged to operating profit Current service cost 0.7 0.7 Past service cost Total operating charge 0.7 0.7 Analysis of the amount that would have been credited charged to other finance income expense Interest on pension liabilities 0.7 0.8 Expected return on schemes assets 0.3 0.4 Net charge 0.4 0.4 Movement in deficit during the year 2005 2004 m m Deficit in scheme at 31st March 2004 8.3 7.7 Current service cost 0.7 0.7 Contributions 2.4 2.4 Other finance income 0.4 0.4 Actuarial gain loss 0.2 1.9 Deficit in scheme at 31st March 2005 6.8 8.3 There have been no refunds of surplus paid to the employer during the current year.

Experience gains and losses on the scheme liabilities are the difference between actuarial assumptions underlying the scheme liabilities and actual experience during the year.
Changes in assumptions underlying the scheme liabilities reflects the changes made to the actuarial assumptions since the last accounting date.

In the case of listed investments this is disclosed based on the quoted market value at the balance sheet date.
In respect of investment in funds, fair value is based on external managers valuations.
In respect of unlisted investments against which write downs have been made, the written down value is considered to be the same as fair value.
In respect of all other unlisted investments the determination of fair value in excess of cost is highly judgemental.
Unless there is an imminent transaction which indicates a fair value materially in excess of cost, the fair value of these investments is taken as cost.
The fair value disclosures are shown below.
