Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards using the historical cost convention.
Change in accounting policy With effect from 1 April 2004, the Group implemented UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts.
As required by UITF 38, own shares held by the FKI Employee Share Trust have been reclassified from fixed asset investments to a reduction in shareholders funds.
The shares will be held at historic cost until they are disposed of.
Any profits or losses on the disposal of own shares are treated as a movement in reserves rather than a profit or loss item.
UITF 17 Employee Share Schemes was also revised at the same time.
The revised UITF 17 requires that the charge to profit and loss account in relation to share awards is to be based on the intrinsic value of the shares at date of grant rather than historic cost.
As a result of implementation of UITF 38, comparative figures have been restated.
The impact on the profit and loss account for the Group and Company in the year ended 31 March 2004, is a reduction in profit after taxation of 0.4 million.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements are made up to 31 March and comprise the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings, together with the Groups share of the results of associated undertakings.
The results of companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included from or up to the effective date of acquisition or disposal respectively.
Acquisitions The net assets of companies or businesses acquired are incorporated into the Group financial statements at their fair value to the Group at the date of acquisition.
Where the fair value of the purchase consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is treated as goodwill arising on acquisition.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 April 1998 was written off to reserves.
From 1 April 1998, goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised in the balance sheet and amortised over periods not exceeding 20 years, in line with the directors view of its useful economic life.
On disposal of a previously acquired business, any attributable goodwill that was previously written off to reserves or that has not been amortised through the profit and loss account is included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, less provision for any impairment in value.
Associated undertakings Associated undertakings are those in which the Group has a participating interest and over which it exerts significant influence.
The Groups share of the results of associated undertakings is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet under the equity method of accounting.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, less depreciation and provision for any impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided on tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold property 50 years Short leasehold property over the lease term Plant and machinery heavy production 15 years other 10 years Office equipment 5 to 10 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years 48 FKI plc 1 Accounting policies continued Leasing and hire purchase commitments Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and leases which result in the transfer to the Group of substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership finance leases are capitalised as tangible fixed assets at the estimated present value of underlying lease payments and are depreciated over their expected useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities whilst the finance elements of the rental payments are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease or hire purchase contract so as to produce a constant rate of charge on the outstanding balance of the net obligation in each period.
Rentals paid under other leases operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Stocks and work in progress Stocks are stated at the lower of cost, on a first-in first-out basis, and net realisable value after making due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving items.
In the case of finished goods and work in progress, cost comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing overheads, based on normal levels of activity.
Long-term contracts are stated at costs incurred, which comprise cost of direct materials and labour plus appropriate overhead expenses, net of amounts transferred to cost of sales and after deducting foreseeable losses and payments on account not matched with turnover.
To the extent that payments on account exceed the value at which long-term contracts are stated, they are included as payments received on account within creditors.
Research and development Development expenditure on clearly defined projects whose outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty is capitalised and amortisation is commenced in the year the expenditure is incurred by reference to the lesser of the life of the project or three years.
All other research and development expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences, subject to the exceptions noted below, that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward foreign currency contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses arising on foreign currency borrowings used to finance the Groups foreign currency equity investments are taken to reserves to the extent that they can be offset against the exchange differences arising on the equity investments.
On consolidation, the balance sheets of non-United Kingdom subsidiary and associated undertakings and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies held by United Kingdom companies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Profit and loss accounts and cash flows of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year, with the year end adjustment to closing rates being taken to reserves.
Differences on exchange arising from the re-translation at year end rates of the net investment in overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings at the beginning of the year are taken to reserves.
All other exchange differences are dealt with in the determination of profit for the financial year.
49 FKI plc Notes to the financial statements Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Turnover Turnover comprises the invoiced value of goods and services supplied by the Group exclusive of value added taxes, sales taxes and intra-group transactions.
In respect of long-term contracts, turnover is calculated on a percentage completion basis, reflecting the extent to which the right to consideration has been earned.
The amount by which recorded turnover on contracts is in excess of payments on account is recorded in debtors as amounts recoverable on contracts.
Attributable profit is recognised on long-term contracts only when the profitable outcome of the contract can be reasonably foreseen and is calculated so as to reflect the proportion of the work carried out at the year end.
Full provision is made in respect of foreseeable losses on uncompleted contracts.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits a Defined contribution pension schemes Pension costs for the Groups defined contribution pension schemes are recognised within operating profit at an amount equal to the contributions payable to the scheme for the period.
Any prepaid or outstanding contributions at the balance sheet date are recognised respectively as assets or liabilities within prepayments or accruals.
b Defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits Pension liabilities are measured at their present value in accordance with actuarial assumptions that are updated at each balance sheet date.
Pension assets are measured at fair value.
The net pension liability or asset, after deferred tax, is recognised in the balance sheet.
Pension costs for the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits are recognised as follows: 1.
Within operating profit The current service cost arising from employee service in the current period: The prior service cost related to employee service in prior periods arising in the current period as a result of improvements to benefits: Gains and losses arising on unanticipated settlements or curtailments where the item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment is recognised within operating profit.
Within other finance cost or income The interest cost on the liabilities, calculated by reference to the scheme liabilities and discount rate at the beginning of the period and allowing for changes during the period: The expected return on assets, calculated by reference to the assets and their long-term expected rate of return at the beginning of the period and allowing for changes during the period.
Within the statement of total recognised gains and losses On the scheme assets the difference between the expected and actual return on assets: On the scheme liabilities a the differences between the actuarial assumptions and actual experience, and b the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions.
Derivatives Derivatives for hedging purposes are held off balance sheet with the exception of cross currency swaps, where the net exchange gain loss as a result of exchange rate movements is recorded on the balance sheet or reflect the substance of the transaction.
The movements in the balance sheet value are recorded in reserves since the borrowing is a hedge of the associated currency net assets.
The net interest cost income arising on interest rate swaps is charged credited to the interest line in the profit and loss account on an accruals basis.
Monetary discounts or premiums arising on the disposal or other early termination of interest rate swaps are amortised over the original unexpired life of the swap against interest charges in the profit and loss account.
Finance costs Finance costs are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of the instruments to which they relate at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by the payments made in the period.

Adjusted earnings per share, which gives a useful indication of underlying performance, is calculated by dividing the profit for the year before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted loss per share, which takes account of the fair value of outstanding share options over the year, is calculated by dividing the loss for the year by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Until such time as they vest unconditionally in employees, both the weighted average share capital and the diluted weighted average share capital exclude shares held in trust under the Long Term Incentive Plan.

Fair values The fair value of the euro guaranteed bonds is based on the market value.
The fair value of the US dollar fixed rate notes is calculated by discounting cash flows based on US Treasury Bond rates plus a margin reflecting current market conditions.
The fair value of other loans and overdrafts is approximately equal to book value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts represents the unrealised foreign exchange gain or loss on revaluation of the instrument at year end exchange rates.
The fair value of currency and interest rate swaps is determined by discounting cash flows at year end exchange rates and interest rates.

It also enters into interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate profile.
Changes in the fair value of instruments used as hedges are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged position matures, except for cross-currency swaps where the value of the swap is applied to the related borrowing to reflect the substance of the transaction.

Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The table below shows the Groups currency exposures: in other words, those transactions or non-structural exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.
These exposures were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities 31 March 2005 Sterling US dollar Euro Other Total Functional currency of Group operations m m m m m Sterling 7.0 4.8 5.8 3.6 US dollar Euro 1.8 0.1 1.7 Other 0.2 1.7 0.1 0.3 1.7 Total 0.2 3.5 4.7 6.0 7.0 Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities 31 March 2004 Sterling US dollar Euro Other Total Functional currency of Group operations m m m m m Sterling 1.2 1.4 0.2 2.4 US dollar Euro 1.2 0.3 1.5 Other 0.2 1.1 0.4 0.5 Total 0.2 1.1 1.8 0.5 0.4 The amounts shown in the tables above take into account the effect of any currency swaps, forward contracts and other derivatives entered into to manage these currency exposures.

66 FKI plc Notes to the financial statements 26 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits a Defined contribution pension schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds.
Contributions to these defined contribution pension schemes in the year, which were the same as the amount charged to the profit and loss account, amounted to 7.4 million 2004: 9.4 million.
b Defined benefit pension schemes The main pension schemes operated by the Group are in the United Kingdom and North America and are defined benefit in type.
These are funded schemes, where the future liabilities for benefits are provided for by the accumulation of assets held externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds.
The cost of these schemes is determined in accordance with FRS 17 with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries on the basis of formal actuarial valuations using the projected unit method.
In line with normal business practice, these valuations are undertaken triennially in the United Kingdom and annually in the United States.
The dates of the most recent full actuarial valuations, on which the amounts in the financial statements are based, were as follows: Name of scheme Location Date of valuation FKI Group Pension Scheme UK 31 December 2002 FKI Industries Inc Group Pension Plans US 31 December 2002 These valuations were updated at 31 March 2005 by independent, professionally qualified actuaries using the assumptions shown in the table below which are consistent with the requirements of FRS 17.
Both the FKI Group Pension Scheme and the main FKI Industries Inc Group Pension Plan are closed to new members and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost would be expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
