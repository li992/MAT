This authority will be limited to the purchase of not more than 14.9% of the Ordinary Shares currently in issue.
This represents the maximum amount of Ordinary Share capital in issue which is permitted before tender or partial offer to all shareholders is require to be made to perform any share buy-back.
The maximum price payable under this authority will be 105% of the average of the middle market quotations of an Ordinary Share for the five business days before the relevant purchase and the minimum price will be 2.5p per Ordinary Share.
In considering whether or not to purchase Ordinary Shares under the market purchase authority, the Directors will take into account cash resources, the effect on gearing and other investment opportunities before exercising the authority.
In addition, the Company will only exercise the authority to make such a purchase in the market when the Directors consider it is in the best interests of the shareholders generally to do so and it should result in an increase in Earnings per Ordinary Share.
The Directors current intention is that the authority sought by Resolution 11 shall be utilised in respect of employee share options as they are exercised.
As at 29 November 2005, there were options to subscribe for 1,858,455 equity shares outstanding under various schemes representing approximately 0.82% of the current issued share capital of the Company.
If the authority sought by Resolution 11 was exercised in full, the number of outstanding options would represent approximately 0.97% of the issued share capital following the repurchase of shares.
