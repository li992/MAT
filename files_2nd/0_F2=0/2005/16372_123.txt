Dividends Our interim ordinary dividends are normally announced in November and paid in December.
Final ordinary dividends are normally proposed in February and, if approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meetings, paid in June.
The following tables show the dividends paid by NV and PLC for the last five years.
NV dividends are per 0.51 ordinary share and PLC dividends are per 1.4p ordinary share and per depositary receipt of 5.6p.
Dividends for NV have been translated into US dollars at the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of declaration.
The PLC interim dividend for 2001 was translated into US dollars at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of payment of the sterling dividend.
Following a change in practice, starting with the final dividend for 2001, PLC dividends have been translated into US dollars at the rate prevailing on the date of declaration of the dividend.
The interim dividend is normally 35% of the previous years total normal dividend per share, based on the stronger of our two parent currencies over the first nine months of the year.
Equalisation of the interim dividend in the other currency takes place at the average exchange rate of the third quarter.
Equalisation of the final dividend takes place at the average exchange rate for the full year.
Final dividends for 2005 are payable on 12 June 2006, subject to approval at the AGMs.
For purposes of illustration, the amounts payable in respect of NV New York shares and PLC ADRs have been translated in the table below at rates of exchange on 9 February 2006, which is the date on which the proposed dividends were announced.
The actual amounts payable in US dollars will be calculated by reference to the exchange rates on the day on which the dividends are approved 8 May 2006 in the case of NV and 9 May 2006 in thecaseofPLC.
The dividend timetable for 2006 is shown on page 189.
