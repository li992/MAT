ACCOUNTING POLICIES The main policies are: a Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in compliance with all applicable accounting standards, the requirements of the Financial Services Authority and, except for the treatment of grants and contributions on infrastructure assets, with the Companies Act 1985.
An explanation of this departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 is given in note 1 h below.
b Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements include the results of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings, each made up to 31 March 2005, together with the attributable share of results and reserves of joint ventures on the basis of their latest financial statements.
The results of any undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are included for the periods of ownership.
c Turnover Turnover, excluding Value Added Tax, represents the income receivable in the ordinary course of business for goods and services provided.
d Landfill tax Landfill tax is included within both turnover and operating costs.
e Intangible fixed assets and amortisation From 1 April 1998, goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiary, joint venture and associated undertakings, representing the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired, is capitalised and classified as an asset on the balance sheet.
Where goodwill has a finite economic life, it is amortised evenly over that period.
For acquisitions before 1 April 1988 goodwill arising on acquisitions was written-off directly to Group reserves.
When a subsidiary, joint venture or associated undertaking is sold, the profit or loss on disposal is determined after including the attributable amount of unamortised goodwill or the goodwill previously written-off to Group reserves.
f Tangible fixed assets and depreciation i Infrastructure assets being mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams, pipelines and sea outfalls Infrastructure assets comprise a network that, as a whole, is intended to be maintained in perpetuity at a specified level of service by the continuing replacement and refurbishment of its components.
Expenditure on infrastructure assets relating to increases in capacity or enhancement of the network, in accordance with defined standards of service and to the maintenance of the operating capacity of the network, is treated as an addition and included at cost after deducting grants and contributions.
The depreciation charge on infrastructure assets represents the level of annual expenditure required to maintain the operating capacity of the network and is calculated from an independently certified Asset Management Plan.
ii Landfill sites Landfill sites are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of a landfill site is depreciated over its estimated operational life taking account of the usage of void space.
Cost includes acquisition and development expenses.
54 Pennon Group Plc NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued f Tangible fixed assets and depreciation continued iii Other assets including properties, overground plant and equipment Other assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other assets are depreciated evenly over their estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows: Leasehold buildings Over the period of the lease Freehold buildings 30 60 years Operational structures 40 80 years Fixed plant 20 40 years Vehicles, mobile plant and computers 3 10 years Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
The cost of assets includes directly attributable labour and overhead costs that are incremental to the Group.
g Leased assets Assets held under finance leases are included in the balance sheet as tangible fixed assets at their equivalent capital value and are depreciated over their estimated economic lives or the finance lease period, whichever is the shorter.
The corresponding liability is recorded as a creditor.
The interest element of the rental costs is charged against profits, using the actuarial method, over the period of the lease.
Rental costs arising under operating leases are charged against profits in the year they are incurred.
h Grants and contributions Grants and contributions receivable in respect of capital expenditure on non-infrastructure assets are included in the balance sheet as deferred income and are released to profits over the depreciable lives of the assets to which they relate.
Grants and contributions receivable relating to infrastructure assets have been deducted from the cost of tangible fixed assets.
This is not in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 which requires tangible fixed assets to be shown at cost and hence grants and contributions as deferred income.
This departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 is, in the opinion of the Directors, necessary for the financial statements to show a true and fair view as, while a provision is made for depreciation of infrastructure assets, it is calculated from an independently certified Asset Management Plan and not determinable finite lives.
Therefore, no basis exists on which to recognise grants and contributions as deferred income.
The effect of this treatment on the value of tangible fixed assets is disclosed in note 15.
Grants and contributions receivable in respect of expenditure charged against profits in the year have been included in the profit and loss account.
i Investments Listed investments held as current assets are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Short-dated unlisted securities held as current assets are stated at cost plus accrued income.
Pennon Group Plc 55 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued j Employee Share Ownership Plan The cost of shares acquired under the Employee Share Ownership Plan is recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period to which the performance criteria relate and is based on an assessment of the expectations of the extent to which those performance criteria will be met.
To meet the award, shares are held in a discretionary trust.
Until such time as the shares vest unconditionally with the employees, the consideration paid for the shares is deducted in arriving at shareholders funds.
The application of the Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 17 revised 2003 Employee Shares Schemes and Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts has resulted in a change in the method of accounting for shares acquired under the Employee Share Ownership Plan.
The effect of this change is disclosed in note 13. k Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes labour, materials and an element of overheads.
l Pension costs The expected cost of pensions in respect of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes is charged against profits so as to spread the cost of pensions over the service lives of employees in the schemes.
A pension surplus or deficit is released or charged to profits using the straight-line method, over the remaining service lives of employees in the scheme.
Pension costs for the Groups defined contribution schemes are charged against profits in the year in which they are incurred.
The financial statements reflect, as set out in note 33, only the disclosure requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits.
m Research and development expenditure Research and development expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which it is incurred.
n Taxation Tax payable on profits for the year is provided at current rates.
Tax deferred or accelerated as a result of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and for accounting purposes is provided in full.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material the current amount of the reversals of tax deferred is discounted to its present value.
The unwinding of the discount to present value is included in the tax charge.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which the deferred tax asset can be recovered in future periods.
o Environmental and landfill restoration costs Provisions for restoration, aftercare and environmental control costs are made when an obligation arises.
Where the obligation recognised as a provision gives access to future economic benefits, a tangible fixed asset is recognised.
Provisions are otherwise charged against profits.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the current amount of the provision is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle obligations.
The unwinding of the discount to present value is included as a financial item within net interest payable.
p Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge interest rate risks.
All such hedging instruments, including interest differentials which arise, are matched with their underlying hedged item.

All share options with an exercise price lower than the average market price of the Companys shares during the year have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENTS The Groups accounting policy on the treatment of shares acquired under the Employee Share Ownership Plan has been changed following adoption of Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 17 revised 2003 Employee Share Schemes UITF17 revised 2003 and Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 Accounting for Employee Share Option Plan ESOP Trusts UITF38.
The policy adopted by the Group for the treatment of shares acquired under the Employee Share Ownership Plan recognises in the profit and loss account the cost of an award on a straight-line basis over the period to which the performance criteria relate and is based on an assessment of the expectations of the extent to which those performance criteria will be met.
Previously, the shares acquired by the trust were recognised on the balance sheet at cost of acquisition less impairment, being the charge to profits over the period to which the employees performance related.
Any gain or loss on transactions in own shares will be reported through the statement of movements in shareholders funds.

RESERVES continued A Long-Term Incentive Plan is operated for senior management of the Group.
Awards under the Plan, involving the release of ordinary shares in the Company to participants, are dependent upon performance conditions being met.
Shares are also held as part of an Incentive Bonus Plan operated for senior management of the Group.
Awards under the Plan involve the release of ordinary shares in the Company to participants, usually conditional upon continuous service with the Company for a period of three years from the award.
The shares described above are released out of an Employee Share Ownership Plan, a discretionary trust, established to facilitate the operation of the incentive plans.
Shares held by the discretionary trust, which is controlled by the Company, are deducted at cost in arriving at shareholders funds.
The cost of an award is recognised in the profit and loss account as employment costs on a straight-line basis over the period to which the performance criteria relate and is based on an assessment of the expectation of the extent that those performance criteria will be met.
This is a change of accounting policy and the prior year adjustment is set out in note 13.
More information on the operation of the incentive plans is included in the Directors remuneration report on pages 38 to 44.

Interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities After taking into account interest rate swaps entered into by the Group, the interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities was: Financial assets Financial liabilities 2005 2004 2005 2004 m m m m Floating rate 302.1 262.6 650.6 668.5 Fixed rate 2.1 6.1 771.0 673.3 On which no interest is paid 2.5 2.7 0.2 19.6 306.7 271.4 1,421.8 1,361.4 Which is included in: Net debt 302.8 267.7 1,421.6 1,341.8 Provisions for liabilities and charges 0.2 1.3 Deferred income 18.2 Other long-term monetary assets liabilities 3.9 3.7 0.1 306.7 271.4 1,421.8 1,361.4 Fixed rate financial assets and liabilities: Weighted average interest rate 6.8% 6.1% 6.4% 6.5% Weighted average period for which rate is fixed 3.6 years 2.6 years 4.0 years 2.8 years Range of interest rates 3.5% to 4.2% to 4.0% to 4.3% to 8.0% 8.0% 11.3% 11.3% Financial assets and liabilities on which no interest is paid: Weighted average period until maturity 1.0 years 14.2 years All financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
The floating rate financial assets earn interest, in some cases fixed in advance for periods up to twelve months, based on short-term money market rates.
The floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates, in some cases fixed in advance for periods up to twelve months, related to the London Inter Bank Offer Rate LIBOR or equivalent.
The maturity profile of floating rate and fixed rate financial liabilities is shown in note 29.
Other financial liabilities fall due for payment principally after five years.
74 Pennon Group Plc NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 30.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Interest rate swaps are used to manage the mix of fixed and floating rates to ensure at least 50% of net debt is at fixed rate: at 31 March 2005 69% of net debt was at fixed rate 2004 62% : at 31 March 2005 interest rate swaps to hedge financial liabilities with a notional principal value of 365.0 million existed, with a weighted average maturity of 2.4 years 2004 490.0 million, with 1.3 years to swap from floating to fixed rate.
At 31 March 2004 floating rate interest rate swaps, to hedge financial liabilities with a notional principal value of 200.0 million, existed to swap LIBOR to European Inter Bank Offer Rate EURIBOR with commencement dates between 1 April 2006 and 1 April 2010 and maturing on 31 March 2030.
A settlement of 18.2 million, which was received when these swaps were entered into during December 1999, was deferred note 25.
In May 2004 these interest rate swaps were terminated through the payment of 3.4 million.
The net balance of 14.8 million received remains deferred and will be matched with interest charges on the underlying hedged debt over the period of the original swaps.
The notional principal amounts of the interest rate swaps are used to determine settlement under those swaps and are not, therefore, an exposure for the Group.
Financial assets and liabilities exclude short-term debtors and creditors other than loans and obligations under finance leases falling due within one year.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities Fair values are established at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and the character of the financial instrument, using estimates that are subjective in nature.
The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are as follows: 2005 2004 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Financial assets: Current asset investments 298.4 298.4 253.7 253.8 Cash at bank 4.4 4.4 14.0 14.0 Other 3.9 4.0 3.7 3.8 306.7 306.8 271.4 271.6 Financial liabilities: Short-term debt 54.8 54.4 107.0 107.4 Long-term debt 1,366.8 1,363.8 1,234.8 1,226.3 Other 0.2 0.2 1.4 1.4 1,421.8 1,418.4 1,343.2 1,335.1 Derivative financial instruments used to manage interest rate profile : Interest rate swaps 0.9 18.2 6.1 Pennon Group Plc 75 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 30.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Market values, where available, have been used to determine fair values.
The fair values of floating rate loans and obligations under finance leases have been estimated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
Other floating rate liabilities, floating rate current asset investments and cash at bank are assumed to have a fair value equal to book value.

Other adjustments include additional creditors for taxation following a reassessment of the taxation affairs of the company for preacquisition periods.
On 19 November 2004, the entire issued share capital of Mac-Glass Recycling Limited was purchased by Viridor Waste Management Limited through the issue of loan notes by Pennon Group Plc of 0.9 million note 29.
The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and provisional goodwill arising on the acquisition, amounting to 0.9 million, has been capitalised and will be amortised evenly over the Directors estimate of useful economic life, which is 20 years.
The profit after tax of Mac-Glass Recycling Limited amounted to 0.1 million for the period from 1 December 2003 to 18 November 2004.
The company incurred a loss of 0.1 million for the year ended 30 November 2003.

PENSIONS The Group operates a number of pension schemes including a defined contribution section within the main scheme.
The assets of the Groups pension schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The latest actuarial valuation of the main scheme was as at 1 April 2004.
At that date, the market value of the schemes assets was 196.4 million and this covered 77% of the value of benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for assumed future increases in earnings.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments, the rates of increase in earnings and pensions, current life expectancy of pensioners and future improvements in life expectancy.
The valuation assumes that the investment return would be 6.7% per annum before retirement and 5.5% per annum after retirement, pensionable pay increases would average 3.7% per annum and that present and future pensions would both increase at a rate of 2.7% per annum.
The pension cost of the main defined benefit scheme has been determined on the advice of the independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The employers regular pension cost for the year was 11.5% of pensionable earnings 2004 11.5%.
The pension charge for the year ended 31 March 2005 for the main scheme was 12.3 million 2004 5.6 million reflecting the recovery of the pension deficit identified in the 1 April 2004 actuarial valuation over the average remaining service lives of employees in the scheme.
Accrued pension costs included as creditors of the Group amount to 4.0 million 2004 prepayment 4.6 million, representing the accumulated difference between the Group pension charge and employer contributions paid.
The Group accounts for pension benefits in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits FRS 17 was originally intended to change the basis of accounting for pension benefits from 2003 04 but full implementation has been deferred until 2005 06.
Under transitional arrangements applying to FRS 17, certain additional disclosures are still required and these are given below.
The full actuarial valuation at 1 April 2004 was updated at 31 March 2005 by the independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method, as required by FRS 17.
