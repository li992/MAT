Tax attributable to the exceptional interest charges in 2004 was a credit of 1.6m.
Factors affecting the tax charge for the year The tax assessed for the year is higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30%.
The differences are explained below: 2005 2004 m m Profit on ordinary activities before tax 42.1 54.2 Profit on ordinary activities before tax at a rate of 30% 12.6 16.3 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.4 0.6 Effect of negative goodwill written back 1.8 2.3 Tax on fair values released on sales 7.4 7.2 Effect of timing differences 0.7 0.5 Difference between tax and accounting profit on disposals 0.9 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 0.6 Total current tax 17.9 19.8 Factors that may affect future tax charges No provisions for deferred tax have been made on gains which would become payable if the groups investment properties were sold at their year end values.
The estimate of unprovided deferred tax is 23.6m 2004: 15.9m.
74 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Notes to the financial statements continued 7 Taxation continued FRS19 prohibits the making of provisions for contingent tax liabilities on the fair value of properties on the acquisition of companies.
It had previously been industry practice to make partial provision for such liabilities as part of the fair value exercise on acquisition.
Thus there is a greater tax charge on property sales where there is no brought forward contingent tax provision available to be utilised in its reduction.
The total contingent tax to the group on the difference between original cost and carrying value of trading properties not provided at 30 September 2005 is 76.9m 2004: 83.3m.

The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the group in independently administered funds.
Pension arrangements for executive directors are disclosed in the remuneration committee report.
The pension cost charge in these financial statements represents contributions payable by the group see note 6.
At the start of the financial year, BPT Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bromley, was contributing to two pension schemes.
The first was a defined contribution scheme, implemented in 2003 and open to all employees.
During the year, the employees were transferred to Grainger Limited and all pension contributions were made into the Grainger Limited defined contribution scheme instead of the BPT scheme.
The second is a defined benefit scheme, which was closed to new members and employee contributions during 2003.
The group will continue to contribute to this scheme so as to spread the cost over the expected remaining service lives of the relevant employees.
BPT Defined benefit scheme The assets of the BPT defined benefit scheme are held separately from those of the group in funds administered by trustees and are invested with an independent investment manager.
Costs and funding are assessed with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the attained age method.
Actuarial valuations are carried out every three years.
The last full actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 1 July 2004.
Based on actuarial assumptions of an investment return of 6.5% per annum and salary increases of 5% per annum, the assets were valued at 10.5m.
These were held in a relevant insurance contract.
These assets represented 79% of the value of the schemes accrued liabilities.
The actuary has recommended an employer contribution rate of 28.5% in order to eliminate the deficiency over the expected future working lifetimes of the members.
91 27 Pension schemes continued The actuary also undertook a Minimum Funding Requirement valuation as at 1 July 2004 in accordance with the Pensions Act 1995.
The value of the assets of the scheme was determined at 101% of the liabilities of the scheme.
FRS17 transitional disclosures The FRS17 calculations for disclosure purposes have been based on a valuation at 1 July 2004 adjusted to 30 September 2005 and adjusted to the projected unit method by a qualified independent actuary.
