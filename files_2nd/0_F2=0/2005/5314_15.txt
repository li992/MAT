6 Pension schemes The funding of the United Kingdom defined benefit scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
The pension costs for the year ended 31 March 2005 amounted to 8.1m 2004: 5.7m.
In addition, the contributions paid by the Group to the defined contribution section of the Scheme in the year ended 31 March 2005 amounted to 0.4m 2004: 0.2m and contributions to funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes of 0.3m 2004: 0.3m.
The most recent valuation carried out in 2004 adopted a market related approach to funding using the projected unit credit method.
The assumptions underlying the calculation of the liabilities were derived by reference to the gross redemption yield on long term gilts in conjunction with a pre-retirement equity enhancement, consistent with market conditions at the time of the valuation.
The principal assumptions applied in the 2004 valuation were therefore as follows: Past Future service service Investment return: before retirement 6.75% 7.50% after retirement 5.00% 5.75% Rate of future earnings inflation 4.00% 4.00% Rate of increase in pensions payment 3.00% 3.00% At the date of the 2004 valuation, the market value of the assets of the scheme was 173.2m, and the actuarial valuation of the assets covered 78% of the benefits that had accrued to the members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The corresponding deficit amounted to 47.7m.
In order to eliminate this deficit, the Group is making annual payments of 4.3m increasing at 3% per annum over a period of 15 years to the scheme.
This deficit funding is included in the 8.1m above.
The next valuation will be carried out at 31 March 2007.
Under the statutory minimum funding requirement, the Schemes funding level is estimated at between 135% and 140% as at 31 March 2005.
In addition to the UK scheme outlined above there are certain pension benefits provided on a defined contribution basis in Australia and North America amounting to 0.7m 2004: 0.7m, on a defined benefit basis in Germany and Ireland amounting to 0.4m 2004: 0.4m, and via government schemes in France, Italy, Denmark and North Asia amounting to 1.6m 2004: 1.8m.

Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 49 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued For the year ended 31 March 2005 17 Own shares UITF 38: Accounting for ESOP Trusts, effective for periods ending on or after 22 June 2004, requires the assets and liabilities of the Groups ESOP trust to be recognised in the Groups financial statements where there is defacto control of those assets and liabilities.
The Companys own shares held by the ESOP trust should be deducted from shareholders funds until they vest unconditionally with employees.
Prior to the adoption of UITF 38, the Companys own shares held by the ESOP trust were recognised as an asset on the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Compliance with UITF 38 has reduced the 2004 investments and shareholders funds by 1.3m and increased profit for the year ended 31 March 2004 by 0.2m.
The estimated impact on the current years profit if UITF 38 had not been adopted would have been to reduce net profit by 0.2m.
The new standard has no impact on cash flows.
During the year no ordinary shares in the Company were purchased by the trustees 2004: none.
At 31 March 2005, a total of 308,417 2004: 308,417 ordinary shares in the Company were held by the Electrocomponents Employee Trust, all of which were under option to employees for a nominal consideration.

52 Electrocomponents plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Financial Statements Financial Statements b Borrowing facilities As at 31 March 2005 the Group had a 202.6m committed borrowing facility 2004: 135.1m denominated in US Dollars, of which 113.6m was undrawn 2004: 56.4m.
The undrawn amount will all expire in between two and five years.
c Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities It is considered that the fair value of all the Groups financial assets and liabilities approximates to their carrying value because of the short term nature of these amounts.
d Group hedging The Group hedges a very high percentage of the foreign currency exposure arising from its trading activities over the course of the next 12 months, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Company provides foreign currency inter-company loans to a number of its subsidiaries.
The foreign currency asset in the parent company is hedged in full using currency swaps over equal and opposite external foreign currency borrowings.
This has the effect on a Group basis of converting an inter-company loan into a partial hedge against net foreign currency assets in the relevant currency.
The following table shows the nominal Sterling amount of the forward foreign exchange contracts in place at 31 March 2005 valued at the forward contracted rates and at the year end rates.
The difference between the two is the unrecognised gain or loss.
The hedges have no book value.

Throughout the year and as at the year end, the Group had one interest rate swap.
This converted fixed interest to floating interest on 6.3m Euro 4.3m.
The unrecognised gain arising on this interest rate swap as at 31 March 2005 was 0.2m 2004: nil.
