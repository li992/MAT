A summary of the movements in goodwill is presented below: 2005 2004 US$000 US$000 At 1 January, net of amortisation 49,653 26,376 Acquisitions during the year 5,405 19,118 Amortisation charge 2,484 Exchange difference 5,875 6,643 At 31 December, net of amortisation 49,183 49,653 Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to three individual cash-generating units, which are reportable segments, for impairment testing as follows: Facilities Management cash-generating unit comprising Petrofac Facilities Management and Plant Asset Management Training cash-generating unit comprising Petrofac Training, Chrysalis Learning and Rubicon Response Resources cash-generating unit comprising Petrofac Resources International Limited These represent the lowest level within the group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Facilities Management and Training cash-generating units The recoverable amounts for the Facilities Management and Training units have been determined based on value in use calculations, using discounted pre-tax cash flow projections.
Management has adopted a 10 year projection period to assess each units value in use as it considers the life of the goodwill for both the Facilities Management and Training cash-generating units to significantly exceed the 5 year impairment test period referred to in IAS 36.
The cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period, extrapolated, thereafter at a growth rate of 5% per annum.
Management considers this a conservative long-term growth rate relative to both the economic outlook for the units in their respective markets within the oil & gas industry and the growth rates experienced in the recent past by each unit.
Resources cash-generating unit The recoverable amount of the Resources unit is also determined on a value in use calculation using discounted pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and economic parameters for the unit approved by senior management and covering a five-year period, as recommended under IAS 36.
