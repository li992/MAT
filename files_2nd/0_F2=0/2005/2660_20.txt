Notes to the consolidated financial statements Accounting policies Basis of preparation These financial statements comply with the Gibraltar Companies Consolidated Accounts Ordinance 1999, the Gibraltar Companies Accounts Ordinance 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Ordinance 1930, as amended.
Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2005 will be made available following the Companys Annual General Meeting.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those International Financial Reporting Standards including International Accounting Standards IASs and interpretations, collectively IFRS, published by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB which have been adopted by the European Commission and endorsed for use in the EU.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention other than for the valuation of certain financial instruments.
The functional currency used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements is United States Dollars USD as is the presentation currency.
The functional currency is the currency in which the parent company operates and it reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances of the Group.
A small minority of Group companies operate in Pounds Sterling and Indian Rupees but the amounts involved are not material.
Assets, liabilities and expenses of the Group are translated from Pounds Sterling and Indian Rupees into USD as follows: assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate existing at the balance sheet date: income and expenses are translated at the exchange rates existing at the dates of the transactions or at a rate that approximates the actual exchange rates: equity items other than the net profit or loss for the period that are included within retained earnings are translated at the closing rate existing at the balance sheet date: and any exchange differences arising from the above translations are recognised in the income statement.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are those companies controlled, directly or indirectly by PartyGaming Plc.
Control exists where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Except as noted below, subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition i. e. the date on which control of the subsidiary effectively commences to the date of disposal i. e. the date on which control over the subsidiary effectively ceases.
Except as noted below, the financial information of subsidiaries is included in the consolidated financial statements using the acquisition method of accounting.
On the date of acquisition the assets and liabilities of the relevant subsidiaries are measured at their fair values.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Under Section 10 2 of the Gibraltar Consolidated Accounts Ordinance 1999, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Accounting for the Companys acquisition of the controlling interest in PartyGaming Holdings Limited The Companys controlling interest in its directly held, wholly owned subsidiary, PartyGaming Holdings Limited formerly Headwall Ventures Limited, was acquired through a transaction under common control, as defined in IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The Directors note that transactions under common control are outside the scope of IFRS 3 and that there is no guidance elsewhere in IFRS covering such transactions.
IFRS contain specific guidance to be followed where a transaction falls outside the scope of IFRS.
This guidance is included at paragraphs 10 to 12 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.
This requires, inter alia, that where IFRS does not include guidance for a particular issue, the Directors may also consider the most recent pronouncements of other standard setting bodies that use a similar conceptual framework to develop accounting standards.
In this regard, it is noted that the United States Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB has issued an accounting standard covering business combinations FAS 141 that is similar in a number of respects to IFRS 3.
Further there is currently a major project being run jointly by the IASB and FASB to converge IFRS and US GAAP.
In contrast to IFRS 3, FAS 141 does include, as an Appendix, limited accounting guidance for transactions under common control which, as with IFRS 3, are outside the scope of that accounting standard.
The guidance contained in FAS 141 indicates that a form of accounting that is similar to pooling of interests accounting, which was previously set out in Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion 16, may be used when accounting for transactions under common control.
Having considered the requirements of IAS 8, and the guidance included within FAS 141, it is considered appropriate to use a form of accounting which is similar to pooling of interests when dealing with the transaction in which the Company acquired its controlling interest in PartyGaming Holdings Limited.
83 83 PartyGaming Plc PartyGaming Plc Annual r Annual report 2005 eport 2005 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Accounting policies continued In consequence, the Consolidated Financial Statements for PartyGaming Plc reports the result of operations for the period as though the acquisition of its controlling interest through a transaction under common control had occurred at 1 January 2004.
The effects of intercompany transactions have been eliminated in determining the results of operations for the period prior to the acquisition of the controlling interest, meaning that those results are on substantially the same basis as the results of operations for the period after the acquisition of the controlling interest.
Similarly, the consolidated balance sheets and other financial information have been presented as though the assets and liabilities of the combining entities had been transferred at 1 January 2004.
Associates Where the Group has the power to exercise significant influence over but not control the financial and operating policy decisions of another entity, it is classified as an associate.
Associates are initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at cost.
The Groups share of post-acquisition profits and losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except that losses in excess of the Groups investment in the associate are not recognised unless there is an obligation to make good those losses.
Profits and losses arising on transactions between the Group and its associates are recognised only to the extent of unrelated investors interests in the associate.
The investors share in the associates profits and losses resulting from these transactions is eliminated against the carrying value of the associate.
Any premium paid for an associate above the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the associate and subject to impairment in the same way as goodwill arising on a business combination described below.
Investments in associates held by the Company are carried at cost less any impairment in value.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries held by the Company are carried at cost less any impairment in value.
Foreign currency Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates the functional currency are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are similarly recognised immediately in the income statement.
Revenue Revenue from online gaming, comprising poker, casino and white label skins third party entities that use the Groups platform and certain services, is recognised in the accounting periods in which the gaming transactions occur.
Poker revenue represents the commission rake charged or tournament entry fees where the player has concluded his participation in the tournament.
Casino revenue represents net house win.
Revenue in respect of white label skin arrangements is the net commission invoiced.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and is net of certain promotional bonuses.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Segment information A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services business segment, or products or services within a particular economic environment geographical segment which are subject to risks and rewards that are different to those of other segments.
Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
84 PartyGaming Plc Annual report 2005 Accounting policies continued Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes directly attributable costs incurred in bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use, including professional fees.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all property, plant and equipment, evenly over their expected useful lives.
It is calculated at the following rates: Leasehold improvements over length of lease Plant, machinery, computer equipment 33% per annum Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment, vehicles 20% per annum Where an item of property, plant or equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised where it is incurred to replace a component of an item of plant, property or equipment where that item is accounted for separately including major inspection and overhaul.
All other subsequent expenditure is expensed as incurred, unless it increases the future economic benefits to be derived from that item of plant, property and equipment.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Groups share of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquired subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity.
For acquisitions where the agreement date is on or after 31 March 2004, goodwill is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on earlier acquisitions was being amortised over its estimated useful life of 20 years.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the unamortised balance of goodwill at 31 December 2004 was frozen and reviewed for impairment, and will be reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Intangible assets Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The identified intangibles are amortised over the useful economic life of the assets.
For acquisitions during the period the useful economic life of the intangible assets acquired is estimated to be between 18 months and five years.
Internally generated assets research and development expenditure Expenditure incurred on development activities, including the Groups software development, is capitalised only where the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
All other development expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure, including that incurred in order to maintain the related intangible assets current level of performance, is expensed as incurred.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
An impairment loss for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period unless: The impairment loss was caused by a specific external event of an exceptional nature that was not expected to recur: and Subsequent external events have occurred that reverse the effect of that event.
85 85 PartyGaming Plc PartyGaming Plc Annual r Annual report 2005 eport 2005 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Accounting policies continued Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at amortised cost less provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with financial institutions.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
They include unrestricted short-term bank deposits originally purchased with maturities of three months or less.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost.
Share option charge The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equitysettled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of the Shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a suitable option pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the liability incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability.
Up to the point at which the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement, with changes being recorded in the income statement.
The Group records the expense based on the fair value of the share-based payments on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Provisions The Group recognises a provision in the balance sheet when it has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where time value is material, the amount of the related provision is calculated by discounting the cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects market assessments of the time value of money and any risks specific to the liability.
Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Financial instruments A substantial portion of the Groups revenue is received in its functional currency.
As such, currency exposure on revenues is minimal.
Further, the Group minimises foreign currency exposure by netting non-US$ deposits and payments of winnings in the respective currency.
Additionally, other exposures include interest rate risk from borrowings and the investment of cash balances.
The Group seeks to limit these risks by investing cash in short-term instruments and interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends to equity Shareholders, this is when declared by the Directors.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Bank borrowings Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are charged to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
86 PartyGaming Plc Annual report 2005 1. Business and geographical segment information For management purposes and transacting with customers, the Group is divided into the following two operating divisions: Poker: and Casino.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Unallocated corporate expenses, assets and liabilities relate to the entity as a whole and cannot be allocated to individual segments.

Under the terms of the plan, the existing workforce were granted a number of nil-cost options to be satisfied by existing shares which had been issued to a dedicated employee trust.
As such, the exercise of these options had no dilutive effect on Shareholders who subscribed at the IPO and will have no cash impact on the Company.
International Financial Reporting Standards requires that the fair value of the options be amortised through the income statement over the life of the options.
Nil-cost options issued pre-IPO were granted in order to attract and retain key employees and are considered to be significant.
As a result there is a non-cash charge of $65.6 million 2004: $3.2 million, which has been included within the income statement in the period.
This can be analysed as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2005 2004 $million $million Charge relating to nil-cost options issued pre-IPO 63.4 3.2 nil-cost options issued post-IPO 2.2 Total 65.6 3.2 Of the nil-cost options issued, $10.4 million 2004: nil related to employees of the parent company.
2 b IPO-related expenses The total IPO-related expenses were $88.0 million of which the Company incurred $22.6 million 2004: nil.
Given that no new money was being raised for the Company, the IPO-related expenses were apportioned between the selling Shareholders and the Company based on contractual arrangements.
2 c Skin-related settlement costs At the time of the IPO, the Group made it clear that it would seek to change the basis of its relationships with its skins partners, the rationale for them having diminished following the Groups rapid expansion since 2003.
In November 2005, the Group announced the acquisition of the player database and intellectual property of MultiPoker for US$14.5 million in cash.
MultiPoker is a leader in online poker in Scandinavia with more than 255,000 registered players.
The Group also announced the termination of its skin arrangement with IntertopsPoker.
com which has since become an affiliate of PartyPoker, allowing PartyPoker to market its services to IntertopsPoker.
At the same time the Group announced that it had agreed to terminate its skin arrangement with Coral Eurobet.
Also in November 2005, the Group announced that it was in discussions regarding a possible offer to acquire the business and assets of Empire Online Limited EOL.
Those discussions were terminated on 21 November 2005 and EOL announced that it was proposing to commence legal proceedings against the Group for, inter alia, breach of contract following the separation of PartyPoker from the rest of the Groups skins.
On 14 February 2006, the Group announced that it had agreed to acquire the business and assets of EmpirePoker.
com, its last remaining skin, from EOL as well as some other associated assets, for a total cash consideration of $250 million.
As part of the transaction, that is subject to the approval by EOL shareholders on 6 March 2006, EOL has agreed to withdraw all legal claims against the Group.
As required under IFRS, a non-recurring charge of $145.8 million has been included in the 2005 financial year within Administration Expenses to reflect the settlement of disputes arising from the separation of PartyPoker players from EmpirePoker and all of the other third party skins.
The agreement with EOL is conditional upon the approval of EOL shareholders and the Group has received irrevocable powers of attorney from EOL shareholders representing approximately 56 per cent of the issued share capital of EOL to effect that their votes will be cast in favour of any necessary resolution.

Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rate prevailing in the relevant jurisdiction.
There are no material deferred tax balances arising in the year.

However, the rules and practice governing the taxation of e-commerce activity are evolving in many countries.
It is possible that the amount of tax that will eventually become payable may differ from the amount provided in these financial statements.
In calculating the tax provision, in addition to any amounts due in respect of jurisdictions in which Group companies are currently incorporated or domiciled, a provision has been made to cover the Directors best estimate of additional taxation exposures which may arise.
The Group has received indemnities from the Principal Shareholders in connection with certain potential historic corporate taxation liabilities.
The Directors consider the likelihood of any such liability arising to be remote.
Accordingly, neither has a provision for any such potential taxation been made, nor has an asset been recognised in respect of the indemnity.

Tax continued c Factors that may affect future tax charges At the year end, there were PartyGaming Group companies and associates registered in Gibraltar, India and the UK.
In Gibraltar, the Group benefits from the exempt company regime.
The Gibraltar exempt company regime will be phased out between 1 July 2006 and 31 December 2010: under current rules assessable income is taxed in Gibraltar at 35.0%.
In India, the Group benefits from a tax holiday on income from qualifying activities until March 2009: under current rules assessable income is taxed in India at approximately 36.6%.
