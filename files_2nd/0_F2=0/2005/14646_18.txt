32 Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Corporate information The Groups consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 23 February 2006.
Spirent plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys Ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange and, in the form of American Depositary Shares, on the New York Stock Exchange.
As required by the European Unions IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 1985, the Group has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
IFRS as adopted by the EU differ in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
However, the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented would be no different had the Group applied IFRS as issued by the IASB.
References to IFRS hereafter should be construed as references to IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The significant accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation This is the first year in which the Group has prepared its financial statements under IFRS and the comparatives have been restated from UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP to comply with IFRS.
The Group issued a press release on 15 July 2005 incorporating its preliminary IFRS financial statements for 2003 and 2004.
The reconciliations to IFRS from the previously published UK GAAP financial statements are summarised in note 39.
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Where the Group has applied different policies for part of the period since its transition to IFRS on 1 January 2003, this is explained in note 39.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.
Results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
All intra Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Interests in associates and joint venture The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of profits or losses of associates and joint ventures.
Associates are those in which the Group is in a position to exercise significant inuence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the operating policy decisions of the investee.
Results are based on management accounts to 31 December each year.
The investment in associates is accounted for using the equity method and carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate, less any impairment in value.
Jointly controlled entities in which the Group enters into a contractual arrangement to undertake an economic activity with another party or parties that is subject to joint control are treated as joint ventures.
The investment in joint ventures is accounted for using the equity method.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, representing the excess of cost over the net fair value of the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is capitalised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill in each cash-generating unit is tested annually for impairment and more frequently if there is any indication that the current asset value is not recoverable.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management, usually at business segment level or statutory company level as the case may be.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit, an operation within a cash-generating unit, an associate or jointly controlled entity is included in the profit or loss on its disposal.
Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 33 Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Separately identiable intangible assets such as patent fees, licence fees and trade marks are capitalised on the balance sheet only when the value can be measured reliably or the intangible asset is purchased as part of the acquisition of a business.
Such intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets arising on the Groups various product development projects are recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: i an asset is created that can be separately identied such as software or a new process : ii it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benets: iii the development cost can be measured reliably: iv it is intended that the asset is completed and used: and v there is adequate financial, technical and other resources to complete, use or sell the asset.
Product development costs are expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product under development has been established.
Technological feasibility in Spirents circumstances occurs when a working model is completed.
For software development technological feasibility is not established until the process of developing the software is complete.
After technological feasibility is established, additional costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment.
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of all other assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location.
Usual asset lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Properties held under finance leases Over the lease period Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years Fixtures, ttings and equipment Building installations 20 years or lease period if less Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Business systems software 4 years The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement of those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
The increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
34 Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Leases Finance leases, which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets concerned, are capitalised on the balance sheet at the lower of fair value of the leased property and net present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liabilities are recorded as long term or current liabilities depending on the period when they are due.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases as a finance cost.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance cost and the reduction in the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over their useful life as above.
Operating leases are leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity and excluding borrowing costs.
Net realisable value represents selling price less further costs to be incurred to completion and on sale.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identied.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Provisions Provisions are recorded when the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event which it is probable that the Group will be required to settle by an outow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reect the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Revenue recognition Goods and services Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benets will ow to the Group, the revenue can be reliably measured and when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership.
In addition, revenue is only recognised when collectibility is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered.
Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognised over the period of performance.
Revenue from product sales of hardware and software is recognised at the time of delivery and acceptance and when there are no significant vendor obligations remaining.
It is not until acceptance has occurred that the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer.
Terms of acceptance are dependent upon the specic contractual arrangement agreed with the customer.
Contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other because they are capable of being provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component.
To the extent that a separate component comprises a product sale of hardware or software, revenue is recognised as described above.
Revenue is recognised on other components as the Group fulls its contractual obligations and to the extent that it has earned the right to consideration.
Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 35 Foreign currencies The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Groups functional and presentation currency.
The Group determines the functional currency of its foreign operations and items included in the financial statements are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are measured in terms of historical costs using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transactions.
The functional currencies of the Groups operations are principally US dollar, sterling or euro.
On consolidation the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated into the Groups presentation currency at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The results of foreign operations are translated into sterling using average rates.
Equity investments in foreign operations include long term intra group loans, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of opening net assets of foreign investments and exchange adjustments arising from the translation of the results of foreign operations, are classied as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as part of the profit or loss on disposal should an operation be disposed of.
The Group has elected to apply the exemption in IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards which allows the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be deemed to be zero at the date of transition to IFRS.
The gain or loss on the subsequent disposal of any foreign operation therefore excludes translation differences that arose before the date of transition.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at closing rates of exchange.
As permitted by IFRS 1 the Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions prior to the date of transition to IFRS and treated as an asset of the parent, as sterling denominated.
All other exchange profits and losses are taken to the income statement, with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide an effective hedge against the Groups equity investments in foreign operations, which are taken to equity together with the exchange differences on the carrying amount of the related investments.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
Issue costs are amortised over the expected life of the instrument.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
From 1 January 2005, hedge accounting is adopted where derivatives such as xed to oating interest rate swaps are held as fair value hedges against xed interest rate borrowings.
Under fair value hedge accounting, xed interest rate borrowings are revalued at each balance sheet date by the change in the fair value attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged.
Equity instruments Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to uctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
The Groups policy is not to undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
Such derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value with effect from 1 January 2005.
From 1 January 2005, such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
36 Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity proles.
Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the Groups exposure to movements in interest rates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to market rates for similar instruments.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classied as fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: or cash ow hedges where they hedge exposure to the variability in cash ows that is due to the risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
The Group discontinues hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation.
In relation to these fair value hedges interest rate swaps which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement and any gain or loss on the item that is being hedged is adjusted against its carrying amount and recognised in the income statement.
In relation to cash ow hedges forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge rm commitments or highly probable forecast transactions and which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the proportion of the gain or loss on the remeasurement of the fair value of the hedging instrument that is deemed to be effective is recognised in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
When the rm commitment or highly probable forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, the associated gains and losses that have previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the carrying amount of the asset or liability at the time the asset or liability is recognised.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the income statement.
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments, which are cancelled due to termination of the underlying exposure, are taken to the income statement immediately.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
Pension contributions In the UK, the Group operates two dened benefit pension schemes for the benefit of employees.
These schemes require contributions to be made to separately administered funds, based on triennial actuarial valuations.
Other schemes are dened contribution in nature.
The cost of providing benets under the dened benefit pension schemes is determined separately for each scheme using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benets to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of dened benefit obligation and is based on actuarial advice.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benets have vested.
When a settlement eliminating all obligations for benets already accrued or a curtailment reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the scheme membership or a reduction in future entitlement occurs the obligation and related scheme assets are remeasured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
The interest element of the dened benefit cost represents the change in present value of scheme obligations resulting from the passage of time and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on scheme assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of scheme assets of contributions received and benets paid during the year.
The difference between the expected return on scheme assets and the interest cost is recognised in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they occur.
The dened benefit pension asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the total for each scheme of the present value of the dened benefit obligation using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds, less any past service cost not yet recognised and less the fair value of scheme assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price.
The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the sum of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount the Group expects to recover by way of refunds from the scheme or reductions in the future contributions.
Contributions payable to the dened contribution schemes are charged to the income statement in the year for which they are due.
Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 37 Employee benets When an employee has rendered services to the Group during an accounting period, short term benets expected to be paid in exchange for those services are recognised in the same accounting period.
Share-based payment Employees including directors of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined using a binomial model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fullled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date, until the vesting date, reects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that will ultimately vest, in the opinion of the directors of the Company at that date and based on the best available estimates.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modied, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modied.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modication, as measured at the date of modication.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modication of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reected in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of certain options to employees.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 Share-based Payment only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 which were unvested at 1 January 2005.
Tax Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued New standards and interpretations not applied During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS Effective date IFRS 1 Amendment relating to IFRS 6 1 January 2006 IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Financial Guarantee Contracts 1 January 2006 IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Assets 1 January 2006 IFRS 6 Amendment relating to IFRS 6 1 January 2006 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS 21 Amendment to IAS 21 The effects of change in foreign exchange rates: Net Investment in a Foreign Operation 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Fair Value Option 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Amendments to IAS 39 Transition and Initial Recognition of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Day 1 profits 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Cash Flow Hedge Accounting 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Financial Guarantee Contracts 1 January 2006 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease 1 January 2006 IFRIC 5 Rights to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds 1 January 2006 IFRIC 6 Liabilities arising from Participating in a Specic Market Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment 1 December 2005 IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 39 Financial Reporting in Hyperinationary Economies 1 March 2006 The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Upon adoption of IFRS 7, the Group will have to disclose additional information about its financial instruments, their signicance and the nature and extent of risks that they give rise to.
More specically, the Group will need to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure in greater detail.
There will be no effect on reported income or net assets.
Revenue 2005 2004 2003 million million million Sales of goods 228.8 250.9 251.8 Maintenance and support services 30.5 36.3 40.0 Total revenue from continuing operations 259.3 287.2 291.8 Revenues for discontinued operations principally relate to sales of goods.
Segmental analysis The Groups primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments.
Business segments For management purposes, the Group is currently organised on a worldwide basis into three operating groups: Communications, Network Products and Systems.
Communications is further subdivided into two divisions: Performance Analysis and Service Assurance.
These four operating segments are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
The principal activities of each segment are as follows: Performance Analysis division of the Communications group develops testing solutions for a broad range of Communications technologies critical to the development of next-generation network equipment and devices: Service Assurance division of the Communications group provides network monitoring and management systems for service providers to assure the quality of their high bandwidth data services.
Sales include hardware and software products as well as maintenance and support services: Network Products group develops and manufactures innovative solutions for fastening, identication, protection and connectivity in electrical and communications networks marketed under the global brand HellermannTyton: and Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 39 Systems group comprises PG Drives Technology, which develops power control systems for specialist electrical vehicles in the mobility and industrial markets and, until August 2003, an aerospace business that provided ground-based logistics support software systems for the aviation market.
As described in note 6, the Network Products group and the investment in associated companies HellermannTyton Division has been classied as a discontinued operation.
Non-segmental costs represent corporate expenses, non-segmental assets comprise cash held for central treasury purposes and other corporate assets and non-segmental liabilities represent senior unsecured loan notes, dened benefit pension fund deficit and other corporate liabilities.

Discontinued operations On 19 September 2005, Spirent plc announced that it had commenced a formal process that was expected to result in the disposal of all of the HellermannTyton Division.
This decision was consistent with the stated strategy of focusing on growing the Communications group.
This process has progressed and on 15 December 2005 the Board accepted a formal offer from funds controlled by Doughty Hanson & Co Limited for this division for 288.9 million at a cash free debt free equivalent value.
This transaction was subject to shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 24 January 2006 on which date the disposal was approved.
The disposal was completed on 15 February 2006.
At 31 December 2005 the HellermannTyton Division was classied as a disposal group and was held for sale.

Pensions Dened benefit schemes The only significant dened benefit pension schemes are in the United Kingdom and comprise the Staff Pension Plan and the Retirement Cash Plan.
These schemes have been combined for the purposes of the following disclosures.
The most recent actuarial valuation of schemes assets and the present value of the dened benefit schemes obligations using the projected unit credit method at 1 April 2003 have been used and updated by our independent actuaries.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on 1 January 2003 and taken directly to equity of 41.9 million in the Group is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Groups statement of recognised income and expense before 1 January 2003.

Certain members, whose salaries are in excess of this cap, have had their benets increased through unapproved, unfunded arrangements, to the level that would otherwise have applied in respect of the basic salary only.
The Group has contractually agreed to pay the additional retirement benets itself and a provision is made in respect of this obligation in the balance sheet at 31 December 2005 of 0.7 million 2004 0.8 million: 2003 4.8 million.
This represents the actuarial value as confirmed by the Groups pension advisers, of the unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at that date.
The value is assessed and reviewed on a Market Value basis in line with the Main Plan Valuation and adjusted each year by the charge for the year equivalent to a contribution to a funded scheme of 0.1 million 2004 0.1 million: 2003 0.2 million and interest of nil on the unfunded liability 2004 nil: 2003 0.3 million.
The additional death-in-service benets over the statutory cap are separately insured by the Group under an unapproved scheme.
On 1 July 2004, Nicholas Brooks was paid a lump sum of 3.7 million to commute all of his unfunded unapproved pension entitlement which stood at 4.5 million at 31 December 2003.
The Group contributed 47.0 million to its UK final salary scheme in February 2006 from the proceeds of the sale of the HellermannTyton Division see note 40.
Dened contribution schemes United Kingdom The Group maintains dened contribution pension schemes for employees in the UK.
These schemes are known as Cash Builder, Pension Builder and Executive Section.
Employer contributions into these schemes for 2005 were 0.3 million 2004 0.1 million: 2003 0.1 million.
United States The Group maintains dened contribution pension benefit schemes for employees of its US subsidiaries.
These schemes, also known as 401 k Plans, allow employees to defer a percentage of their salary for retirement.
There are four different 401 k Plans within the US businesses and each of these schemes has different features regarding Group contributions, maximum deferral percentages and investment choices.
The investment choices offered are among a selection of diversied mutual funds offering a broad mix of investment return potential with varying levels of risk.
In aggregate, the Group contributions to the various US schemes totalled $4.6 million for 2005 2004 $4.6 million: 2003 $4.4 million.
Total assets in the dened contribution schemes at the end of 2005 were $129.2 million 2004 $116.8 million: 2003 $103.1 million.
There were no dened benefit schemes in the US as at 31 December 2005, 2004 or 2003.
Other jurisdictions Outside the United Kingdom and the United States employees are provided with pension arrangements determined in accordance with approved local practice and regulations and these arrangements are dened contribution schemes.
Total contributions for 2005, in respect of these schemes amounted to 0.3 million 2004 0.3 million: 2003 0.2 million.
Total contributions to dened contribution schemes were 3.1 million 2004 2.9 million: 2003 3.0 million.

As a result of the substantial drop in activity levels in Service Assurance Broadband during the first half of 2005 this unit was tested for impairment.
The recoverable amount of this unit was determined based on a value in use calculation using a pre-tax discount rate of 14.5 per cent.
Following the impairment test, a goodwill charge of 37.0 million was recognised through administration expenses in the first half of 2005.
54 Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 14.
Goodwill continued Annual impairment test The recoverable amounts of the Performance Analysis and Service Assurance Broadband cash-generating units at 30 November 2005, the annual impairment testing date, have been calculated based on a value in use calculation using cash ow projections over a five year period.
These were based on financial budgets approved by the Board for the next year and on approved strategic plans for the following two years.
Cash ows in years four and five have been extrapolated using a 4.0 per cent growth rate which approximates to the average long term growth rate for the industries in which these units operate.
The cash ows were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 15.9 per cent 2004 16.9 per cent: 2003 18.4 per cent and 17.2 per cent 2004 15.6 per cent: 2003 15.0 per cent respectively.
In both cases the recoverable amounts of these units were in excess of their carrying values and no further impairment arose in the second half of 2005.
The key assumptions in these value in use calculations were: Revenue growth rates used in the budget and strategic plans.
Growth rate used to extrapolate cash ows beyond the strategic plan period.
Revenue growth rates used in the budget and strategic plans are based on managements estimate of growth in the markets served, taking into account products yet to be launched and which are in the development pipeline.
They are consistent with external sources of information including comparable companies operating in the same markets and analysts forecasts.
Gross margins are based on historical values achieved by the respective cash-generating units.
Operating expenses are based upon historical levels suitably adjusted for increases in activity levels over the term of the cash ow projections.
The discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reect managements estimate of the specic risk prole associated with the cash ow projections for each cash-generating unit.
Long term growth rates are based upon industry analysis and are consistent with analysts forecasts.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of value in use of the Performance Analysis unit, management believes that no reasonable possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
For the Service Assurance Broadband unit, there are reasonable possible changes in key assumptions which would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
In particular, the revenue growth assumptions in the strategic plan are based upon the successful execution of a new strategy for growth to meet the needs of service providers for their new triple play networks and services.
The strategic plan assumes a significant increase in revenues in 2007, being the full year effect of new products expected to be launched in the second half of 2006.
Should management fail to execute this strategy, such that the anticipated increase in revenue is not realised by 50 per cent or more in that year, and assuming growth is maintained at planned rates thereafter, albeit off a lower base, then value in use would be reduced to a value equal to the carrying amount for this unit.

These assets can only be realised when they reverse against suitable taxable profits.
Although the directors ultimately expect to realise these assets, there is currently insufficient evidence under IAS 12 Income Taxes to recognise a deferred tax asset in respect of these timing differences.
60 Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 24.
Deferred tax continued A deferred tax asset of 15.2 million in respect of the UK final salary pension scheme has not been recognised in 2005.
In 2004 and 2003 an asset was recognised.
In addition, the Group has tax losses arising in the US of 79.6 million 2004 70.6 million: 2003 70.1 million and in the UK of 42.2 million 2004 39.6 million: 2003 24.8 million that are available for offset against future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as their future recovery is uncertain.
US tax losses can be carried forward for 20 years and UK losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
In total deferred taxes assets amounting to 74.2 million 2004 52.6 million: 2003 50.3 million have not been recognised on unutilised losses and timing differences.
0.1 million of deferred tax 2004 2.1 million: 2003 2.1 million is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and the joint venture.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the tax deduction which may be available on the future exercise of stock options.

An interest rate derivative was entered into in 1999 to reduce the effective interest rate to 9.28 per cent 2004 and 2003 9.53 per cent.
Loan notes are repayable: i at maturity: or ii at any time at the Companys option in an amount of not less than 5 per cent of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding plus a make whole amount.
The loan note agreement provides for half yearly covenant ratio testing.
The covenants ratios are as follows: a Net interest cover greater than or equal to 3.0 times: b Net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA less than or equal to 3.0 times: and c Net worth greater than 100 million.
Covenant ratios are calculated using UK GAAP as applied at 31 December 2002.
As the loan notes were repaid in February 2006 covenant testing is not required for 31 December 2005.
If the Group repaid at its option the total principal amount of the loan notes at 31 December 2005, a make whole amount of $14.3 million 8.3 million would become payable.
On 15 February 2006 the loan notes were repaid out of the proceeds of sale of the HellermannTyton Division.
A make whole amount of $13.9 million 7.4 million was also paid see note 40.
Financial risk management The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise trade receivables, trade payables, bank and other loans, loan notes, finance leases, bank overdrafts, cash and short term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments, other than trade receivables and trade payables, is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, for the management of the Groups interest rate and currency risks and other exposures when deemed appropriate.
The key objective of the Group Treasury department is to manage the financial risks of the business and to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to the Group.
All treasury activity operates within a formal control framework.
The Board has approved treasury policies and guidelines and periodically reviews treasury activities.
Additionally, it is the Groups policy that speculative treasury transactions are expressly forbidden.
Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 63 Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long term debt obligations.
The objective of the Groups interest rate management policy is to reduce the volatility of the interest charge.
Interest rate exposure is managed through an optimum mix of xed and oating rate debt and the use of interest rate swaps.
At 31 December 2005, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, approximately 42 per cent 2004 51 per cent: 2003 57 per cent of the Groups borrowings are at a xed rate of interest.
As discussed in note 40, Post balance sheet events, the Groups senior unsecured loan notes were repaid in February 2006.
Foreign currency risk Currency exposures arise from trading transactions undertaken by the Group in foreign currencies and on the translation of the operating results and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
As a result of the Group having significant operations in the United States, its results can be affected signicantly by movements in the US dollar exchange rate.
During the year, sterling weakened against the US dollar.
Group Treasury, by means of forward foreign exchange contracts, carries out the majority of the transaction hedging activity.
The Group does not enter into instruments to hedge the translation exposure of the operating results or net assets of its overseas subsidiaries since these are accounting and not cash exposures.
However, to provide a partial hedge, net investment hedges are entered into to match, as far as possible, the currency of borrowings with the currency prole of the operating results and net assets.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
Financial instrument counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the Group Audit Committee and such approval is limited to financial institutions with a rating of Standard & Poors A or Moodys A-2 or better.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to ensure that there are sufficient sources of funding to meet projected requirements.
Its operations are nanced through a combination of retained earnings and external nancing.
Financing is raised principally by the the parent Company and lent to subsidiaries on commercial terms.
Debt is largely sourced from the syndicated bank market and the US private placement market.

The swaps terminate on 23 November 2009 and can be cancelled at the banks option at six monthly intervals.
The swaps have been transacted with two banks and are split $48.0 million and $24.1 million between them.
The terms of the $48.0 million swap allow for either party to exercise a break on 23 November 2008.
Should a break take place a mark to market settlement would be due at fair value.

Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 73 Potential dilution of issued share capital arising from employee share schemes In accordance with guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers, the following information is provided in respect of possible future dilution of the Companys issued share capital arising from the exercise of awards under the Groups employee share schemes.
The issued share capital at 31 December 2005 was 965.8 million.

These shares were purchased in the market and are held to satisfy exercises under various employee share schemes.
Market purchased shares have been excluded for the purposes of calculating dilution.

Stock appreciation rights awarded under the Netcom Stock Appreciation Rights Plan see note k below for details on this plan are not included in the above gure and are fully hedged by shares in the Employee Share Ownership Trust.
Description of employee share schemes a 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS is now closed however outstanding options may still be exercised and has been replaced by the Employee Incentive Plan referred to in b below.
The HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved ESOS incorporates the guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers ABI at that time.
It was subsequently amended by the Board to facilitate the award of unapproved share options both in the UK and overseas.
Awards under the ESOS, normally determined annually, were at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee after considering recommendations made to it by the Chief Executive.
No price was payable on the grant of an option and no options have been, or could be, granted at a discount to the market price.
The normal exercise period for options granted under the ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Options awarded under the ESOS are subject to the achievement of an earnings per share EPS performance condition before they can be exercised.
The condition is that over a period of three consecutive financial years, there has been an increase in the Companys adjusted EPS which is at least 6 per cent more than the increase in the Retail Price Index over the same period.
The performance condition is tested on the third anniversary of grant and, if it has not been met at that time, at each subsequent anniversary of grant until the option expires ie on the tenth anniversary of grant in normal circumstances.
All ESOS grants made after 11 May 2000 to executive directors are subject to enhanced performance conditions on exercise.
The performance conditions require the Companys adjusted EPS to increase over a period of three consecutive financial years within a range of 9 per cent minimum performance for 25 per cent option vesting and 15 per cent for 100 per cent option vesting, with a sliding scale between these points.
In addition, performance testing over the ten year option term is measured from a base point xed at the date of grant.
Performance will be tested on the third anniversary of grant and, if the target conditions at that time have not yet been met in full, performance will be tested again on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant only, with the performance hurdle being increased in proportion to the extended period.
74 Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32.
Authorised and issued share capital continued b 2005 Employee Incentive Plan EIP On 4 May 2005, Spirent shareholders approved the EIP to replace the now closed ESOS.
The EIP is currently available for selected employees including executive directors on a similar discretionary basis as the ESOS and any awards will be subject to prior satisfactory individual performance.
No price is payable on the grant of an award and no award has been granted at a discount to the market price.
The Company is able to grant share options, including HMRC approved options, share settled stock appreciation rights SARs and performance shares under the EIP.
In normal circumstances, options or SARs under the EIP will vest three years following grant provided the Companys EPS growth targets after excluding ination have been met over a three year performance period.
The growth targets in respect of the initial award require that the Companys EPS increases within a range of 6 per cent per annum for 25 per cent vesting and 15 per cent per annum for 100 per cent vesting over the performance period, with a sliding scale between these points.
In normal circumstances, performance shares under the EIP will vest three years following grant provided the Companys total shareholder return TSR targets have been met over a three year performance period.
The performance conditions require Spirents TSR to be between the median of a comparator group for 30 per cent vesting and the upper quartile of a comparator group for 100 per cent vesting over the performance period, with a sliding scale between these points.
The comparator group consists of the 30 largest companies by market capitalisation in the FTSE TechMARK 100 Index, excluding those TechMARK companies who are also constituents of the FTSE100 Index at the commencement of the performance period.
All EIP awards will be tested once on or shortly following the third anniversary of grant.
Any part of an award which does not vest shall, lapse ie there is no opportunity for retesting.
SARs granted under the EIP will deliver the appreciation value ie the aggregated increase in market value of an Ordinary share over the base price of the SAR in the form of new issue Ordinary shares.
This SARs approach, which is also being utilised for the Spirent Stock Incentive Plan see note c below will help the Company manage its dilution headroom more efficiently as only the SAR gain and not the entire share value needs to be funded.
Using a SARs based approach, it is not possible to determine the precise level of dilution until the SARs are exercised.
2.2 million SARs with a base price of 53 pence were outstanding in respect of the EIP as at 31 December 2005, however, no SARs have been exercised.
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously lapsed or been exercised.
c Spirent Stock Incentive Plan SSIP The SSIP formerly the Spirent Stock Option Plan was introduced in 2000.
This discretionary plan is primarily targeted at selected employees in the Communications group with grants normally determined annually by reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the relevant business and prevailing local market practice.
Under the SSIP, grants are also permitted to selected newly hired and promoted employees on a monthly basis.
Following an Extraordinary General Meeting held in June 2004, shareholders approved the renewal of the SSIP until the Companys 2007 Annual General Meeting along with several amendments including the ability to award SARs as well as stock options.
The Company is mindful of the need to continue to manage shareholder dilution in a responsible manner.
The current shareholder approved mandate regarding annual dilution rates includes an annual allowance of 2.5 per cent of shares outstanding for the SSIP and 0.6 per cent of shares outstanding for the EIP see b above.
The Remuneration Committee does not propose any change to the aggregate of 3.1 per cent of shares outstanding that could be granted annually under both the SSIP and EIP, but believes it would be helpful to allow exibility in the mix to reect future operational requirements.
38.5 million SARs with a base price of between 42 pence and 71 pence were outstanding in respect of the SSIP at 31 December 2005, however, no SARs have been exercised.
Awards made pursuant to the SSIP normally vest over four years, provided that the employee remains in employment.
Awards normally become 25 per cent exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant and thereafter in equal proportions on a monthly basis over a further 36 months.
Any award not exercised by the seventh anniversary of grant will lapse.
SSIP awards granted from June 2004 to certain senior managers will only become exercisable subject to the achievement of applicable EPS performance conditions.
No price is payable on the grant of options or SARs and no options or SARs have been, or can be, granted at a discount to the market price.
d Netcom Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan NARSOP Spirent completed the acquisition of Netcom Systems, Inc. Netcom in 1999.
$44.5 million of the total consideration was satisfied through the roll-over of outstanding options over Netcom shares, primarily held by Netcom employees, into options over approximately 23.8 million Ordinary shares as adjusted on substantially similar terms as previously existed under the NARSOP.
All remaining outstanding options are fully vested and exercisable until they expire.
Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 75 e Zarak Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan ZARSOP Out of a total consideration of approximately 44.9 million Ordinary shares issued for the acquisition of Zarak Systems Corporation Zarak in 2000, approximately 3.8 million shares arose in connection with the roll-over of outstanding options over Zarak shares into options over Spirent Ordinary shares on substantially similar terms as previously existed under the ZARSOP.
These options are primarily held by Zarak employees and have either a five or ten year life from the original date of grant.
Unvested rolled-over options were capable of immediate exercise ie prior to their respective vesting date and any shares arising from such an event were held in the ESOT until the relevant vesting date.
The option holder was entitled to the beneficial but not legal interest in the shares whilst they were held in trust but they remained subject to forfeiture with the original option exercise prices being refunded to the participant if the participants employment was terminated prior to the vesting date.
All ZARSOP options and resulting shares held in the ESOT have now fully vested.
f Caw Amended and Restated Stock Plan CARSP Out of a total initial consideration for the acquisition of Caw Networks, Inc. Caw in 2002 of $49 million, approximately $4 million was in respect of Spirent Ordinary shares and options which arose on the roll-over of outstanding options and shares under the previous Caw employee stock plan.
The options and shares will vest over a period expiring in 2006 on substantially similar terms as previously existed under the CARSP.
The options are held by Caw employees and have a ten year life from the original date of grant.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement for Caw, an additional cash payment of 78.8 US cents was payable as each share vested or upon the exercise of a vested option.
Any Ordinary shares issued under the CARSP are restricted until they have vested or are not at risk from forfeiture under the plan rules.
Unvested rolledover options are capable of immediate exercise ie prior to their respective vesting date and any shares arising from such an event are held in the ESOT until the relevant vesting date.
The option holder is entitled to the beneficial but not legal interest in the shares whilst they are held in the ESOT but they remain subject to forfeiture with the original option exercise prices being refunded to the participant if the participants employment is terminated prior to the vesting date.
In accordance with the original terms for acquiring Caw, in March 2004, Spirent allotted 4.3 million Ordinary shares and issued 75,000 options following the achievement by Caw of certain technical and financial earn out targets.
Participation in the CARSP entitled the participants to a share in the earn out.
Any earn out payment for an outstanding CARSP option was made by increasing the number of shares subject to the option and decreasing the per share exercise price so as to preserve the existing aggregate total exercise price.
Of the 4.3 million shares, 54,000 shares were issued to the ESOT in respect of unvested restricted shares, which remained subject to forfeiture prior to vesting.
As a result of the earn out, the additional cash payment referred to above was adjusted to 66.9 US cents as each share vests or upon the exercise of a vested option.
The Ordinary shares subject to rolled-over options from the acquisition of Netcom, Zarak and Caw, or granted under the SSIP, do not count toward ABI scheme limits.
The plans mentioned in a and d to f above are closed to new entrants and no further awards of options can be made under them.
g UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS and 2005 Sharesave Scheme The SRSOS closed in 2005 and was replaced by the 2005 Sharesave Scheme.
SRSOS options which remain outstanding may still be exercised prior to expiry, however no further grants can be made.
Both schemes operate as HMRC approved Save-As-You-Earn schemes and are open to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period.
Any future sharesave invitations will be made under the 2005 Sharesave Scheme, which is broadly similar to the SRSOS.
The employee enters into a Save-As-You-Earn contract with the Companys savings carrier to save a regular sum of between 5 and 250 per month for a xed period of either three or five years.
No price is payable on the grant of an option.
The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the middle market price of an Ordinary share on the business day prior to the beginning of the invitation period, discounted by up to 20 per cent, at the Boards discretion.
Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the contract commencement date, as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract.
The Company operates the SST to honour the contractual commitment to deliver Ordinary shares against the valid exercise of outstanding options under the SRSOS.
The SST, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spirent plc, acts as sole trustee.
During the year, 276,196 shares were transferred to participants.
SST has waived all rights to receive dividends payable on its registered shareholding except for 0.01 pence per annum in aggregate and accordingly such shareholding is not included in the Companys EPS calculation as referred to in note 13.
76 Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32.
Authorised and issued share capital continued h US Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP The ESPP operates on a broadly similar basis to the Sharesave Scheme.
It enables the Company to grant eligible US employees the right to acquire Spirent American Depositary Shares using proceeds of a savings contract.
When joining the ESPP, participants enter into a contract to save up to 15 per cent of basic salary gross, subject to an individual maximum of $1,000 net per month, over a contract period of 12 months by way of regular payroll deductions.
No price is payable on the grant of a purchase right.
The purchase price will be based on the market value of an Ordinary share either on the first day of the offering period or on the last day of the offering period, whichever price is lower, less a 15 per cent discount or, where shares are to be subscribed, their nominal value if greater.
i Global All Employee Share Purchase Plan GAESPP The GAESPP was approved by shareholders in 2001 and offers employees in countries other than the UK or US an opportunity to share in the Companys performance through share ownership.
The GAESPP was implemented in Canada in January 2002 and operates on similar terms to the ESPP above, with participants entering into a 12 month contract to save up to 15 per cent of basic salary gross, subject to an individual maximum of Cdn $1,000 net per month.
j UK Employee Share Purchase Plan UK ESPP On 4 May 2005, shareholders approved the UK ESPP, which is an HMRC approved share incentive plan, available to all UK employees subject to a qualifying service period.
The UK ESPP offers three ways to provide Ordinary shares to employees: free shares, partnership shares and matching shares.
The UK ESPP will operate in conjunction with a trust, which will hold the shares on the behalf of participants.
Each year awards of free shares may be made to eligible employees up to a value of 3,000.
Awards may be made subject to performance targets determined by the directors.
In normal circumstances, free shares must be held in trust for between three and five years and normally become free of income tax and national insurance if held for five years.
Employees may be offered the opportunity to purchase partnership shares out of monthly contributions taken from pre-tax salary up to 1,500 or 10 per cent of salary, if less.
The directors determine a savings period of between one and 12 months following which the shares are purchased.
Where the savings period is longer than one month, the purchase price will be the lesser of the price at the beginning of the accumulation period or the price at the end.
Participants can withdraw partnership shares from the trust at anytime, however, doing so before five years may trigger a tax liability.
If partnership shares have been offered to employees, the Company may also offer matching shares up to a maximum of two matching shares for each partnership share.
In normal circumstances, matching shares must be held in trust for a period of at least three years and may be subject to forfeiture if the participant leaves employment prior to the end of this period.
No awards have been made so far under this plan.
k Stock Appreciation Rights Plan SARP The SARP was introduced in September 1999 as an interim incentive arrangement for the employees of Netcom following the closure of the NARSOP described in d above and subsequently for certain other employees in the Communications group.
Under the SARP, recruitment, promotion and recognition awards over Ordinary shares have been made in line with historic and local competitive market practice on a quarterly basis at the discretion of a committee of senior executives.
The operation of the SARP reects as far as practicable the now closed NARSOP.
Accordingly, rights under the SARP vest over four years, 25 per cent vesting one year after the date of grant and the remainder vesting on a monthly basis over a further 36 months.
Rights granted are not subject to the fullment of any pre-exercise performance conditions.
The SARP will deliver the appreciation value ie the aggregated increase in the market value of an Ordinary share over the rights price in the form of existing Ordinary shares which have been purchased in the market by the Companys ESOT.
The maximum number of shares over which SARP awards can be made is 5.25 million.
At 31 December 2005, the following rights were outstanding under the SARP: Number of rights Rights price outstanding Rights exercise dates pence million 10.09.00-29.06.10 182-400 2.4 Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 77 33.
Share-based payment The total charge for the year relating to employee share-based payment plans is as follows: 2005 2004 2003 million million million Continuing operations 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme 0.4 0.3 0.1 2005 Employee Incentive Plan 0.1 Spirent Stock Incentive Plan 4.4 3.6 0.2 Acquisition Plans 0.2 0.4 0.5 Employee Sharesave Schemes 0.5 0.1 5.1 4.8 0.9 Discontinued operations 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme 0.4 0.2 0.1 Employee Sharesave Schemes 0.1 0.2 0.5 0.4 0.1 5.6 5.2 1.0 The fair value of the options and purchase rights over Ordinary shares is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model.
The following table gives the assumptions made in arriving at the share-based payments charge: 2005 2004 2003 Weighted average share price pence 53 65 36 Weighted average fair value pence 24 36 19 Expected volatility % 50-55 70 70 Expected life years 4.5 4.5 4.5 Risk free rate % 4.2 4.0-5.1 3.6-4.9 Dividend yield % nil-1.0 1.0 1.0 The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous two years which management considers to be the period which is likely to be most representative of future volatility.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
For performance shares granted under the 2005 Employee Incentive Plan, which have a market based performance condition, it has been assumed that there will be 50 per cent vesting for valuation purposes.

The nature and purpose of each reserve within equity is as follows: i Share premium account: this reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value: ii Capital reserve: this reserve arises in relation to share option plans in acquired companies: iii Capital redemption reserve: this reserve has been eliminated as described below: iv Translation reserve: this reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.
It is also used to record the net investments hedged in these subsidiaries: and v Net unrealised gains and losses: this reserve records movements in fair value of forward currency contracts.
At 31 December 2005, the cumulative amount of goodwill charged to retained earnings as a result of UK GAAP accounting policies prior to 1998, is 43.9 million 2004 and 2003 43.9 million.
Investment in own shares At 31 December 2005, an amount of 2.6 million 2004 2.6 million: 2003 2.6 million is deducted from retained earnings in relation to the cost of investment in own shares.
The investment in own shares relates to 3.2 million Ordinary shares 2004 and 2003 3.5 million held by the Spirent Sharesave Trust SST and 9.4 million Ordinary shares 2004 and 2003 9.5 million held by the Spirent Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT.
Shares held by the SST will be used to satisfy options under the Companys Savings Related Share Option Schemes.
Shares held in the ESOT are primarily held to hedge awards under various discretionary employee share schemes.
The market value of own shares held in trust at 31 December 2005 was 6.2 million 2004 9.6 million: 2003 7.6 million.
Cancellation of share premium and capital redemption reserves On 24 November 2004, Spirent plc was granted an order of the High Court for the approval of the cancellation of the share premium account and capital redemption reserve the Cancellation which stood at that date at 702.7 million and 0.7 million, respectively.
The Cancellation created a reserve in the financial statements of the Company which was applied to eliminate the deficit in distributable reserves.
The balance of this reserve created after the deficit in distributable reserves had been eliminated was transferred to a special non-distributable reserve.
The special non-distributable reserve at 31 December 2005 is 11.1 million 2004 61.6 million: 2003 nil and will be increased in future years to the extent that the Company subsequently realises any value from its assets in excess of the value at which those assets were recorded in the Companys financial statements at the time of the Cancellation.
The special non-distributable reserve will have a maximum value equal to the aggregate of the share premium account and capital redemption reserve at the time of the Cancellation, being 703.4 million.
The special non-distributable reserve will be used to eliminate deficits arising in future years and is only capable of being distributed to the shareholders of the Company once all the creditors of the Company, which existed at the date of the Cancellation, have consented to the Cancellation or have been satisfied in full or on transferring to a blocked trust account a sum equal to the aggregate amount due to any creditors of Spirent plc who were creditors on 24 November 2004 and who remain creditors on the date of release of the special non-distributable reserve.

Remuneration of key management personnel The remuneration of the executive directors, who are the key management personnel of the Group, is set out below in aggregate for each of the categories specified in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures.
Transition to IFRS For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2004, the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
As described in notes 1 and 2 above, these financial statements, for the year ended 31 December 2005, are the first the Group is required to prepare in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
Accordingly, the Group has prepared financial statements which comply with IFRS applicable for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and the significant accounting policies meeting those requirements are described in note 2.
In preparing these financial statements, the Group has started from an opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2003, the Groups date of transition to IFRS, and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements required by IFRS 1 for the first-time adoption of IFRS.
This note explains the principal adjustments made by the Group in restating its UK GAAP balance sheet as at 1 January 2003 and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the two years ended 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2004.
Exemptions applied IFRS 1 allows first-time adopters certain exemptions from the general requirement to apply IFRS as effective for December 2005 year ends retrospectively.
The Group has taken the following exemptions: Comparative information on financial instruments is prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and the Group has adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 January 2005.
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations has been applied prospectively from 1 January 2005, in accordance with the requirements of that standard and IFRS 1.
Accordingly, the comparative balance sheets have not been adjusted for assets and liabilities classied in 2005 as held for sale.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations has not been applied to acquisitions of subsidiaries or interests in associates and joint ventures that occurred before 1 January 2003.
The Group has recognised all cumulative actuarial gains and losses on pensions and other post-retirement benets as at 1 January 2003, directly in equity.
Accordingly, the Group discloses prospectively from 1 January 2003 the information required by IAS 19 Employee Benets on scheme obligations, scheme assets and experience adjustments on scheme assets and liabilities, as those amounts are determined.
Cumulative currency translation differences for all foreign operations are deemed to be zero as at 1 January 2003.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has not been applied to any equity instruments that were granted on or before 7 November 2002, nor has it been applied to equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 that vested before 1 January 2005.
Accounting policies applied in the two years ended 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2004 As noted above, the Group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 with effect from 1 January 2005 and as permitted under IFRS 1 the Group has not restated comparative information.
The new accounting policies as applied for the year ended 31 December 2005 are set out in note 2.
For accounting periods up to the year ended 31 December 2004 the following accounting policies were applied in respect of financial instruments in the financial statements of Group: Derivative instruments The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange rates.
The Group also uses interest rate swaps to adjust interest rate exposures.
The Group considers its derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting when certain criteria are met.
Forward foreign currency contracts The rates under such contracts are used to record the hedged item.
As a result, gains and losses are offset against the foreign exchange gains and losses on the related financial assets and liabilities, or where the instrument is used to hedge a committed future transaction, the gains and losses are not recognised until the transaction occurs.
Interest rate swaps Interest differentials are recognised by accruing with net interest payable.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value or shown on the Group balance sheet at the year end.
If they are terminated early, the gain or loss is spread over the remaining maturity of the original instrument.
84 Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 39.
Transition to IFRS continued Nature of the main adjustments to comply with IAS 32 and IAS 39 Had IAS 32 and IAS 39 been applied from 1 January 2003 all the Groups derivative instruments would have been brought onto the balance sheet at fair value.
Available-for-sale investments and investments held at fair value through profit and loss would have been carried at fair value rather than at cost.
Following adoption of IAS 32 and 39 by the Group, forward currency contracts with a positive fair value of 0.5 million and interest rate swaps with negative fair value of 1.0 million have been recognised in the Group balance sheet at 1 January 2005.
Restatement on the first-time application of IAS 32 and IAS 39 million Current assets Financial assets 0.5 Non-current liabilities Financial liabilities 1.0 Long term borrowings 0.4 Total change in equity note 34 0.1 Explanation of IFRS adjustments to the income statements and balance sheets The most significant adjustments arising from the Groups transition to IFRS are described below and their financial effect is set out in the reconciliations on pages 89 to 93. a IFRS 2 Share-based Payment IFRS 2 requires an expense to be recognised where the Group buys goods or services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions, or in exchange for other assets equivalent in value to a given number of shares or rights over shares cash-settled transactions.
The main impact of IFRS 2 on the Group is the measurement of the expense for employees and directors share options and other share-based incentives by using an option-pricing model.
Effect on the income statement This change has resulted in an increase in the reported charge for share-based payment of 4.6 million for 2004 and 0.4 million for 2003.
The effect of this revised policy on the basic and diluted EPS is as follows: For 2004 a decrease in basic earnings per share of 0.49 pence 2003 0.04 pence.
For 2004 a decrease in diluted earnings per share of 0.48 pence 2003 0.04 pence.
Effect on equity There is no net effect on equity.
Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 85 b IAS 19 Employee Benets IAS 19 permits two different approaches for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
The Group is adopting the approach which is similar to the UK Standard, Financial Reporting Standard FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
Spirent adopted FRS 17 for UK GAAP reporting in 2003 and restated the consolidated balance sheet at 1 January 2003 for the adoption of this standard.
The implementation of IAS 19 in respect of dened benefit pension schemes has had no effect on the reported results of the Group compared with the results reported under UK GAAP.
Under UK GAAP a deferred tax asset arose in respect of the retirement benefit obligation on the dened benefit pension schemes and this was set off against the obligation for disclosure purposes.
IAS 19 requires that the deferred tax asset be separately disclosed as a non-current asset.
IAS 19 also requires companies to make an accrual for holiday pay: under UK GAAP this was not mandatory.
Effect on the income statement The requirement to accrue holiday pay has resulted in a credit to the income statement of 0.8 million for 2004 and no adjustment for 2003.
The effect of this revised policy in respect of the requirement to accrue holiday pay on the basic and diluted EPS is as follows: For 2004 an increase in basic earnings per share of 0.09 pence 2003 nil.
For 2004 an increase in diluted earnings per share of 0.08 pence 2003 nil.
Effect on equity At 31 December 2004, a deferred tax asset of 11.1 million has been reclassied from the dened benefit pension plan deficit to non-current assets.
A similar reclassication was made of 13.0 million at 31 December 2003.
No deferred tax asset was recognised at the transition date 1 January 2003.
An additional accrual of 0.2 million for holiday pay has been reported and included in trade and other payables at 31 December 2004.
A similar adjustment of 1.0 million was made at 31 December 2003 and 1.0 million at 1 January 2003.
86 Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 39.
Transition to IFRS continued c IFRS 3 Business Combinations i Goodwill amortisation The Group made no acquisitions in 2003 or 2004 and has elected not to restate business combinations prior to the transition date of 1 January 2003.
The effect of the adoption of IFRS 3 on the Groups accounting policies has therefore had no impact on the book value of assets and liabilities acquired for prior period acquisitions.
The adoption of IFRS 3 and IAS 36 Impairment of Assets has resulted in the Group ceasing annual goodwill amortisation from 1 January 2003 and introduced the requirement to test for impairment annually at the level of the cash-generating unit or cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated unless an event occurs during the year which requires the goodwill to be tested more frequently.
In addition, the reversal of goodwill amortisation has resulted in a higher goodwill balance denominated in foreign currencies and hence has adjusted the exchange difference on retranslation of goodwill into sterling at each reporting date.
Effect on the income statement Goodwill amortisation of 9.1 million charged in 2004 and 9.7 million charged in 2003 under UK GAAP has been reversed in the restatements under IFRS.
The effect of this revised policy due to the adoption of IFRS 3 on the basic and diluted EPS is as follows: For 2004 an increase in basic earnings per share of 0.97 pence 2003 1.04 pence.
For 2004 an increase in diluted earnings per share of 0.96 pence 2003 1.03 pence.
Effect on equity A cumulative exchange difference of 1.1 million arises on the retranslation of the adjusted goodwill balance at 31 December 2004.
The equivalent cumulative exchange difference was 0.4 million at 31 December 2003.
The reversal of the cumulative goodwill amortisation from transition date together with the exchange effects outlined above have increased the carrying value of goodwill at 31 December 2004 by 17.7 million.
The cumulative adjustment at 31 December 2003 was 9.3 million.
ii profit or loss on disposal Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and will not be included in the calculation of any profit or loss on any subsequent disposal under IFRS.
Effect on the income statement Goodwill written off to reserves arising prior to 1998 and reinstated under UK GAAP on the disposal of operations has been reversed in the amount of 4.9 million and 2.6 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The effect of this revised policy due to the adoption of IFRS 3 on the basic and diluted EPS is as follows: For 2004 an increase in basic earnings per share of 0.52 pence 2003 0.28 pence.
For 2004 an increase in diluted earnings per share of 0.51 pence 2003 0.27 pence.
Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 87 d IAS 12 Income Taxes IAS 12 requires that deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
These deferred tax liabilities were not required to be recognised under UK GAAP.
Effect on the income statement The tax charge for the Group has increased by 0.1 million and that for the associate by 0.1 million for 2003 under IFRS.
There is no effect on the income statement in 2004 and therefore there is no effect on basic or diluted earnings per share 2003 basic and diluted 0.02 pence decrease.
Effect on equity Under IFRS additional deferred tax liabilities for subsidiaries have been recognised of 0.6 million and for associates of 1.5 million at 31 December 2004 and at 31 December 2003.
At the transition date, 1 January 2003, tax liabilities of 0.4 million for subsidiaries and 1.4 million for associates have been recognised under IFRS.
e IAS 28 Investments in Associates and IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures IAS 28 and IAS 31 require that the Groups share of the associates or joint ventures net profit or loss be disclosed in the income statement as one line after charging or crediting the Groups share of the associates or joint ventures interest and tax.
Under UK GAAP the Groups share of interest and tax of the associates and joint ventures were disclosed within the interest or tax lines in the income statement.
Effect on the income statement An amount of 1.0 million of tax has been reclassied to the associates result from the tax charge in 2004 under IFRS.
In 2003, 0.2 million of interest and 1.1 million of tax have been reclassied to the joint ventures result and 0.9 million of tax to the associates result.
Effect on equity There is no effect on equity.
88 Spirent plc Annual Report 2005 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 39.
Transition to IFRS continued f IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates The Group has elected to adopt IAS 21 from the transition date, 1 January 2003.
As a result any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign subsidiary and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are now treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
Goodwill acquired prior to 1 January 2003 that has been treated as an asset of the parent is reported in pounds sterling at the date of transition.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of opening net assets of overseas subsidiaries and exchange adjustments arising from the translation of the results of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, are classied as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
The Group has elected to apply the exemption that allows the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be deemed to be zero at the date of transition to IFRS, 1 January 2003.
The Group has similarly elected that the gain or loss on the subsequent disposal of any foreign operation shall exclude translation differences that arose before the transition date.
For disposals in 2003 and 2004 that occurred after the transition date, the profit or loss on disposal has been restated so as to include the effect of any post-transition translation differences.
Effect on the income statement There is no effect on the income statement in 2004.
In 2003, exchange gains of 2.4 million on foreign operations disposed of have been credited to the income statement.
The effect of this revised policy on the basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows: For 2004 there is no effect on basic earnings per share 2003 0.25 pence increase.
For 2004 there is no effect on diluted earnings per share 2003 0.25 pence increase.
Effect on equity At 31 December 2004, cumulative translation adjustments of 2.8 million have been transferred to a separate translation reserve in accordance with IAS 21.
These, together with the translation effects of other IFRS adjustments, result in a closing balance of 1.6 million on the translation reserve at this date.
The translation reserve at 31 December 2003 was a credit balance of 3.0 million.
g Reclassications Some reclassications are required in the restatements under IFRS.
Effect on the income statement For the dened benefit pension schemes a credit for the expected return on the schemes assets and a charge for the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes liabilities, because the benets are one year closer to settlement, were included in other finance expense or income in the income statement under UK GAAP.
Under IFRS this charge or credit has been reclassied as finance costs.
Effect on equity Under IFRS it is necessary to classify provisions into short term provisions and non-current provisions.
Under IFRS the investment in own shares has been reclassied to retained earnings in the transition date balance sheet and at 31 December 2003.
The investment in own shares was deducted from retained earnings at 31 December 2004 for UK GAAP so no adjustment is required.
For UK GAAP purposes in the following reconciliations the dened benefit pension plan deficit has been reclassied as a non-current liability.
Other The Group has applied IAS 39 prospectively, that is with effect from 1 January 2005, and hence no adjustments for financial instruments are required in the income statement restatements for 2003 or 2004.

The disposal of The HellermannTyton Division was completed on 15 February 2006 when proceeds of 288.9 million were received at a cash free debt free equivalent value.
These proceeds have been applied as follows: Repayment of the senior loan notes of $124.8 million 71.5 million.

Break fees of 2.3 million in respect of interest rate swaps taken out in connection with the senior loan notes.
Special contribution of 47.0 million to the UK final salary pension scheme.
Repayment and cancellation of the bank facility in connection with the acquisition of SwissQual.
Taking these transactions into account the pro forma cash balance is approximately 150 million, of this, 50 million has been earmarked to fund the onmarket share repurchase programme.
The programme is expected to begin in the second quarter, following the completion of certain actions: establishing distributable reserves in the parent Company, clearance from the Pension Regulator and the approval from shareholders to make on-market share repurchases of up to 14.99 per cent of the Companys issued share capital.
Following the disposal of the HellermannTyton Division the Company issued notices of cancellation in respect of all its borrowing facilities.
