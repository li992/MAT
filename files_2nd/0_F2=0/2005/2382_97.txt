The increase reflected higher realizations, partially offset by costs associated with the severe hurricanes and the Thunder Horse stability incident and higher operating and revenue investment costs.
The result included a net charge for non-operating items of $998 million, primarily related to fair value losses on embedded derivatives, net gains on sales of assets, mainly from the sale of Ormen Lange, and net impairment charges.
Capital expenditure was $10.1 billion in 2005 and is expected to be around $11 billion in 2006.
Production was 4,014 thousand barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2005.
Increases in production in our new profit centres and TNK-BP were offset by the effects of severe weather disruptions, higher planned maintenance shutdowns, anticipated decline and operational issues in our existing profit centres.
On the basis of UK generally accepted accounting practice SORP, our proved reserves replacement ratio RRR was 100% on a combined basis of subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities.

BP exploration and production locations MANUFACTURING COVERAGE Replacement cost profit before interest and tax for the segment was $4,405 million, compared with $5,240 million in 2004.
This was affected by the Texas City refinery outage, adverse impacts related to fair value accounting and costs associated with rationalization and efficiency programmes.
Refining volumes were lower in 2005, owing to the impact of disposals and reduced availability.
Refinery throughputs for 2005 were 2,399 thousand barrels a day mb d, compared with 2,607mb d in 2004.
Retail marketing margins were lower than in 2004, reflecting sustained pressure from rising crude and product prices.
Marketing sales were 3,942mb d in 2005, compared with 4,002mb d the previous year.
Shop sales maintained a similar level to the previous year, despite the impact of higher fuel prices.
In 2005, the lubricants business was affected by significantly higher costs of base oil, additives, packaging and logistics.
