6 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is 64.3 pence 2004: 78.4 pence.
The calculation of the basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of 252.8 million 2004: 301.8 million divided by the average number of shares in issue during the year of 393.1 million 2004: 384.8 million.
Diluted earnings per share is 64.0 pence 2004: 77.3 pence.
The calculation is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the average number of shares in issue plus the dilutive potential ordinary shares amounting to 1.8 million 2004: 5.6 million shares.
The dilutive potential ordinary shares relate to shares provisionally allocated under employee share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price.

The operational cycle is such that the majority of inventory will not be realised within 12 months.

At this level of activity and ignoring the effect of other factors such as ination and exchange rate volatility, approximately 66% of inventory is estimated to be realised in excess of 12 months.
In accordance with the accounting policies on finance income and costs as set out on page 47 the Group adds to the cost of inventory certain notional interest, representing the unwinding discount on long term creditors for land to which the Group has neither title nor access.

In accordance with IAS 39 such gains and losses are recognised in the Income Statement with effect from 1 January 2005.
Interest rate swaps are used by the Group to establish an appropriate proportion of fixed rate borrowing.
At the year end the Group had fixed rate borrowings, after taking account of all swaps, approximately equal to net borrowings.
Some of the instruments used by the Group, whilst appropriately managing the economic exposure of the Group, do not meet the conditions required to be classified as hedge instruments.
As a result gains and or losses on interest rate swaps are taken to finance costs in the Income Statement which creates a degree of volatility in finance costs.

The assets of the schemes are held in separate Trustee administered funds.
The largest, which is in the UK, is the George Wimpey Staff Pension Scheme the Scheme, and is of the funded, defined benefit type.
It is closed to new entrants.
The Trustees are George Wimpey Pension Trustees Limited and the Law Debenture Trust Corporation Plc.
The Scheme is subject to triennial valuation by independent actuaries, the last such valuation being carried out as at 31 March 2005, using the projected unit method.
Details of this valuation are given below.
For new employees in the UK contributions are paid into stakeholder pension arrangements.
The actuarial assumptions which have the most significant effect are those relating to return on investment, the rate of increase in salaries and the assumed rate of pension increases.
In the 31 March 2005 valuation it was assumed that the investment return prior to retirement would exceed long dated gilt yields by 2.25% per annum, and post retirement by 0.25% per annum.
Salary increases were assumed to exceed price ination by 2.0% per annum.
Pension increases were assumed to be in line with ination.
The market value of assets was 591 million, and the present value of liabilities accrued to members after allowing for the expected future increase in earnings was 739 million.
This equated to a gross deficit of 148 million, and 104 million net of deferred tax.
The Company has agreed to continue contributions equivalent to 15 million per annum to fund the deficit.
This is in addition to the ongoing costs of providing future service benefits.
The Group has paid contributions of 21.1 million 2004: 22.5 million to the Scheme during the year.
Employee contributions for Laing Homes Scheme members were being phased in up to 1 January 2006 up to the same rate as other employee members.
As part of the terms of their transfer these members paid reduced contributions of 5.0% or 6.0% depending on the accrual rate chosen 2004: 2.0% for all.
From 1 January 2006 all members contribute at the same rate.
No significant changes to benefits were made in 2005.
Contributions in respect of non Laing Homes employees were paid at a rate of 13.2% of Scheme salary plus 15 million 2004: 13.2% plus 15 million during 2005.
In respect of former Laing Homes employees contributions were paid at a rate of 14.9% 2004: 20.2% of Scheme salary throughout 2005.
A qualified, independent actuary updated the 31 March 2005 valuation to 31 December 2005, as required by IAS 19.
The principal assumptions made at 31 December 2005 were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Discount rate 4.9% 5.4% 5.5% Rate of increase in salaries 4.6% 4.6% 4.5% Rate of increase of deferred pensions 2.6% 2.6% 2.5% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.6% 2.6% 2.5% Ination 2.6% 2.6% 2.5% At the time of the 31 March 2005 actuarial valuation of the Scheme a study was undertaken into the recent Scheme mortality experience.
The tables adopted PM FA 92 YOB 1950 for non pensioners and PM FA92 YOB 1925 for pensioners reect the results of this study and represent current expectations of mortality experience within the Scheme.
In particular an appropriate allowance has been made within the assumptions for future mortality improvements.

The expected yield on bonds with fixed interest rates can be derived exactly from their market value.
It is considered that the expected return on equities is 3% over the yield on gilts, which is less than the long term average of 4% to reect more stable GDP, lower ination and reduced volatility of profits.

The amended IAS 19 is almost identical to FRS 17, the figures under which have been previously disclosed in the Notes to the Financial Statements.
The Group has adopted the full recognition method of accounting under the amended IAS 19, whereby movements in the Scheme obligations due to changes in actuarial assumptions or revised terms of the Scheme, are recognised in full through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Accounting for share-based payments under IFRS 2 requires the fair values of options granted after 7 November 2002 to be charged to the Income Statement over the vesting period of the options.
No adjustments are made retrospectively to account for performance related to market based factors.
Under previous UK GAAP where an option was considered unlikely to vest due to not meeting performance targets provisions previously made could be reversed.
In the year to December 2004 there was a 1.7 million credit relating to the reversal of a provision at December 2003 for the 2003 Long Term Incentive Plan.
The credit in the year to December 2004 is eliminated under IFRS.
The Group reports the results of joint ventures using the equity method.
Using this method the Groups share of the post tax results of the joint ventures is reported on a single line on the face of the Income Statement.
Previously the operating result, interest expense and tax credit were reported separately.
Under IFRS 3 Business Combinations amortisation of goodwill is replaced by a regular impairment review of goodwill held on the Balance Sheet.
The reviews have indicated no impairment of the goodwill of 5.2 million in the Balance Sheet at 31 December 2003, and so the amortisation charged in the year to December 2004 has been eliminated.

The amounts reported above as equity adjustments vary slightly from those disclosed in the FRS 17 notes to the 2004 financial statements due to the adjustment to the method of valuing investments required by the amended IAS 19.
IFRS requires the Group to recognise a dividend payable only when it has been announced and, where necessary, approved by shareholders, prior to the Balance Sheet date.
Under IAS 2 Inventories the Group is required to book long term land creditors relating to the purchase of inventories at fair value at the time of recognition.
In subsequent periods, up to the date of payment, the notional interest represented by the unwinding discount is expensed to the Income Statement.
It has long been Group policy to recognise land creditors on the Balance Sheet at exchange of an unconditional binding contract, which is in accordance with IFRS, but historically long term creditors have not been discounted.
This is now done, and consequently the cost of land booked into inventory is lower as it will be at the same amount as the fair value of the creditor recognised.
In accordance with IAS 23 Borrowing Costs notional interest incurred prior to gaining legal title or vacant possession of the land is added to the cost of inventory.
This is believed to more fairly reect the economic reality of the underlying transaction.
The make-up of the reduction of equity due to the revised discounting policy comprises: 31 December 2004 m Reduction in value of land inventory 10.3 Reduction in value of long term creditors 6.8 Tax effect 1.1 2.4 The Group is only complying with IAS 39, as required, with effect from 1 January 2005.
As reported in the December 2004 financial statements hedge accounting has not been adopted for interest hedging instruments.
The fair value of those instruments, net of tax, at 1 January 2005 was 2.1 million gross 2.9 million as reported in note 21 of those statements.
That fair value is recognised in the first Balance Sheet on adoption of IAS 39.
There are no material changes to cash ows under IFRS compared with UK GAAP.
However, under IFRS tax and interest paid are both classified within operating cash ows, whereas they were separately categorised under UK GAAP.
Cash and cash equivalents under IFRS include short term deposits which, under UK GAAP were classified as liquid resources.
