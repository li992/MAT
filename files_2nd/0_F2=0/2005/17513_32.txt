Change of accounting policies As outlined in note 1 these financial statement have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
In preparing the financial statements for the current year, the Company has adopted the following Financial Reporting Standards FRS for the first time: FRS 20 Share-based payments: FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date: FRS 22 Earnings per share: FRS 23 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates: FRS 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation: FRS 26 Financial instruments: Measurement: and FRS 28 Corresponding Amounts.
All standards have been retrospectively applied except for FRS 25 and FRS 26 which have only been applied from 1 January 2005.
The adoption of FRS 20 has resulted in changes in accounting for share-based payment transactions and the adoption of FRS 21 has resulted in changes in the accounting for dividends.
The impact on the profit and loss account from the adoption of FRS 20 is to decrease profit by US$9.1 million in the current year and decrease profit by US$4 million in the prior year.
There was no material impact on the profit and loss account from the adoption of the other standards.
