The recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Given the nature of the groups activities, information on the fair value of an asset is usually difficult to obtain unless negotiations with potential purchasers are taking place.
Consequently, unless indicated otherwise, the recoverable amount used in assessing the impairment charges described below is value in use.
The group generally estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model.
The future cash flows are usually adjusted for risks specific to the asset and discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10% 2004 9% and 2003 9%.
This discount rate is derived from the groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
A different pre-tax discount rate is used where the local tax rate is significantly different from the UK or US corporate tax rates.
Exploration and Production During 2005, Exploration and Production recognized total charges of $266 million for impairment in respect of producing oil and gas properties.
The major element of this was a charge of $226 million relating to fields in the Shelf and Coastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico.
The triggers for the impairment tests were primarily the effect of Hurricane Rita, which extensively damaged certain offshore and onshore production facilities, leading to repair costs and higher estimates of the eventual cost of decommissioning the production facilities and, in addition, reduced estimates of the quantities of hydrocarbons recoverable from some of these fields.
The recoverable amount was based on managements estimate of fair value less costs to sell consistent with recent transactions in the area.
The remainder related to fields in the UK North Sea, which were tested for impairment following a review of the economic performance of these assets.
During 2004, as a result of impairment triggers, reviews were conducted that have resulted in impairment charges of $83 million in respect of Kings Peak in the Gulf of Mexico, $20 million in respect of two fields in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf Matagorda Island area and $184 million in respect of various US onshore fields.
A charge of $88 million was reflected in respect of a gas processing plant in the US and a charge of $60 million following the blow-out of the Temsah platform in Egypt.
In addition, following the lapse of the sale agreement for oil and gas properties in Venezuela, $31 million of the previously booked impairment charge was released.
The 2003 charge for impairment includes a charge of $296 million for four fields in the Gulf of Mexico, following technical reassessment and re-evaluation of future investment options: charges of $133 million and $49 million respectively for the Miller and Viscount fields in the UK North Sea as a result of a decision not to proceed with waterflood and gas import options and a reserve write-down respectively: a charge of $105 million for the Yacheng field in China: a charge of $108 million for the Kepadong field in Indonesia: and $47 million for the Eugene Island West Cameron fields in the US as a result of reserve write-downs following completion of our routine full technical reviews.
In addition, there were impairment charges of $217 million and $58 million for oil and gas properties in Venezuela and Canada respectively, based on fair value less costs to sell for transactions expected to complete in early 2004.
Refining and Marketing During 2005, certain retail assets were written down to fair value less costs to sell.
With the formation of Olefins and Derivatives at the end of 2004, certain agreements and assets were restructured to reflect the arms-length relationship that would exist in the future.
This has resulted in an impairment of the petrochemicals facilities at Hull, UK.
Other businesses and corporate The impairment charge for 2005 relates to the write-off of additional goodwill on the Solvay transactions.
In 2004, in connection with the Solvay transactions, the group recognized impairment charges of $325 million for goodwill and $270 million for property, plant and equipment in BP Solvay Polyethylene Europe.
As part of a restructuring of the North American Olefins and Derivatives businesses, decisions were taken to exit certain businesses and facilities, resulting in impairments and write-downs of $294 million.
