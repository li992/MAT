For Exploration and Production, goodwill has been allocated to each geographic region, that is UK, Rest of Europe, US and Rest of World, and for Refining and Marketing, goodwill has been allocated to strategic performance units SPUs, namely Refining, Retail, Lubricants, Aromatics and Acetyls and Business Marketing.
In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit including goodwill is compared with the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a cash-generating unit, the recoverable amount is deemed to be the value in use.
The group generally estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model.
The future cash flows are usually adjusted for risks specific to the asset and discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10% 2004 9% and 2003 9%.
This discount rate is derived from the groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
A different pre-tax discount rate is used where the local tax rate is significantly different from the UK or US corporate tax rates.
The five-year group plan, which is approved on an annual basis by senior management, is the source for information for the determination of the various values in use.
It contains implicit forecasts for oil and natural gas production, refinery throughputs, sales volumes for various types of refined products e. g. gasoline and lubricants, revenues, costs and capital expenditure.
As an initial step to the preparation of this plan, various environmental assumptions, such as oil prices, natural gas prices, refining margins, refined product margins and cost inflation rates, are set by senior management.
These environmental assumptions take account of existing prices, global supply-demand equilibrium for oil and natural gas, other macroeconomic factors and historical trends and variability.
For the purposes of impairment testing, the groups oil price assumption is for the Brent oil price to drop from an average 2005 price of $55 per barrel in equal annual steps over the next three years to $25 per barrel in 2009 and to remain flat thereafter 2004 $38 per barrel stepping down to $20 per barrel in 2008 and beyond and 2003 $29 per barrel stepping down to $20 per barrel in 2007 and beyond.
Similarly, Henry Hub natural gas prices drop from an average $8.65 per mmBtu in 2005 to $4.00 per mmBtu in 2009 and beyond 2004 $6.15 per mmBtu stepping down to $3.50 per mmBtu in 2008 and beyond and 2003 $5.35 per mmBtu stepping down to $3.50 per mmBtu in 2007 and beyond.
These prices are adjusted to arrive at appropriate consistent price assumptions for different qualities of oil and gas.
EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION The value in use is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by the projected oil or natural gas production profiles up to the expected dates of cessation of production of each producing field.
The date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the production profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, the production costs, the contractual duration of the production concession and the selling price of the hydrocarbons produced.
As each producing field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the cash flows of the fields are computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions agreed by BPs management for the purpose.
Cash outflows and hydrocarbon production quantities for the first five years are agreed as part of the annual planning process.
Thereafter, estimated production quantities and cash outflows up to the date of cessation of production are developed to be consistent with this.
The following table shows the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to each of the regions of the Exploration and Production segment and the amount by which the recoverable amount value in use exceeds the carrying amount of the goodwill and other non-current assets in the cash-generating units to which the goodwill has been allocated.
No impairment charge is required.

To test the sensitivity of the excess of the recoverable amount over the carrying amount of goodwill and other non-current assets shown above the headroom to changes in production volumes and oil and natural gas prices, management has developed rules of thumb for these two key assumptions.
Applying these gives an indication of the impact on the headroom of possible changes in the key assumptions.
On the basis of the rules of thumb using estimated 2006 production profiles extrapolated over an average 15-year production life, it is estimated that a long-term decrease of $1 per barrel in the price of Brent crude or $0.1 per mmBtu of Henry Hub gas with corresponding adjustments to other prices would cause the above excess of recoverable amount over carrying amount to be reduced by $3.3 billion in respect of oil production and $0.6 billion for gas production.
Consequently, it is estimated that the long-term price of Brent crude that would cause the total recoverable amount to be equal to the total carrying amount of the goodwill and related non-current assets for individual cash-generating units would be of the order of $25 per barrel for the UK and $26 per barrel for the US.
No reasonably possible change in oil or gas prices would cause the headroom in Rest of World to be reduced to zero.
Estimated production volumes are based on detailed data for the fields and take into account development plans for the fields agreed by management as part of the long-term planning process.
It is estimated that, if all our production were to be reduced by 10% for the whole of the next 15 years, this would not be sufficient to reduce the excess of recoverable amount over the carrying amounts of the individual cash-generating units to zero.
Consequently, management believes no reasonably possible change in the production assumption would cause the carrying amount of goodwill and other non-current assets to exceed their recoverable amount.
REFINING AND MARKETING For all cash-generating units, the cash flows for the next five years are derived from the five-year group plan.
The cost inflation rate is assumed to be 2.5% 2004 2.5% and 2003 2.5% throughout the period.
For determining the value in use for each of the SPUs, cash flows for a period of 10 years have been discounted and aggregated with its terminal value.
Refining Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a 2% growth rate 2004 4% and 2003 2%.
The key assumptions to which the calculation of value in use for the Refining unit is most sensitive are gross margins, production volumes and the terminal value.
The value assigned to the gross margin is based on $5.25 per barrel global indicator margin GIM, which is then adjusted for specific refinery configurations 2004 $2.70 per barrel and 2003 $2.70 per barrel, except in the first year of the plan period when a GIM of $7.25 is used, reflecting market conditions expected in the near term.
The value assigned to the production volume is 900mmbbl a year 2004 900mmbbl and 2003 1,100mmbbl and remains constant over the plan period.
The value assigned to the terminal value assumption is 5 times earnings 2004 5 times and 2003 5 times, which is indicative of similar assets in the current market.
These key assumptions reflect past experience and are consistent with external sources.
The Refining units recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount by $13.6 billion.
Based on sensitivity analysis, it is estimated that if the GIM changes by $1 per barrel, the Refining units value in use changes by $7.7 billion and, if there is an adverse change in the GIM of $1.75 per barrel, the recoverable amount of the Refining unit would equal its carrying amount.
If the volume assumption changes by 5% the Refining units value in use changes by $3.1 billion and if there is an adverse change in Refining volumes of 200mmbbl a year, the recoverable amount of the Refining unit would equal its carrying amount.
If the multiple of earnings used in the terminal value changes by 1 then the Refining units value in use changes by $1.7 billion.
Management believes no reasonably possible change in the multiple of earnings used in the terminal value would lead to the Refining value in use being equal to its carrying amount.
Retail The cash flows beyond the five-year period assume no growth in fuel margins 2004 1% decline and 2003 no growth, reflecting a competitive marketplace.
The key assumptions to which the calculation of value in use for the Retail unit is most sensitive are unit gross margins, branded marketing volumes, the terminal value and discount rate.
The value assigned to the unit gross margin varies between markets.
For the purpose of planning, each market develops a gross margin based on a market-specific reference price adjusted for the different income streams within the market and other market specific factors.
The weighted average Retail reference margin used in the plan was 5.4 cents per litre 2004 4.6 cents per litre and 2003 4.3 cents per litre.
The value assigned to the branded marketing volume assumption is 101 billion litres a year 2004 106 billion litres a year and 2003 107 billion litres a year.
The unit gross margin assumptions decline on average by 0.8% a year over the plan period and marketing volume assumptions grow by an average of 2% a year over the plan period.
The value assigned to the terminal value assumption is 6.5 times earnings 2004 6.5 times and 2003 6.5 times, which is indicative of similar assets in the current market.
The Retail units recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount by $1.5 billion.
It is estimated that, if there is an adverse change in the unit gross margin of 7.5%, the recoverable amount of the Retail unit would equal its carrying amount.
It is estimated that, if the volume assumption changes by 5%, the Retail units value in use changes by $1 billion and, if there is an adverse change in Retail volumes of 8 billion litres a year, the recoverable amount of the Retail unit would equal its carrying amount.
If the multiple of earnings used in the terminal value changes by 1 then the Retail units value in use changes by $0.5 billion and, if the multiple of earnings falls to 3 times, then the Retail value in use would equal its carrying amount.
A change of 1% in the discount rate would change the Retail value in use by $0.7 billion and, if the discount rate increases to 12%, the value in use of the Retail unit would equal its carrying amount.
Lubricants Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a 3% sales volume growth rate 2004 3% and 2003 3%, which is lower than the long-term average growth rate for the first five years.
The terminal value for the Lubricants unit represents cash flows discounted to perpetuity.
For the Lubricants unit, the key assumptions to which the calculation of value in use is most sensitive are operating margin, sales volumes and the discount rate.
The values assigned to the operating margin and sales volumes are 49 cents per litre 2004 51 cents per litre and 2003 55 cents per litre and 3.3 billion litres a year 2004 3.3 billion litres and 2003 3.4 billion litres.
These key assumptions reflect past experience.
The Lubricants units recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount by $4.0 billion.
If there is an adverse change in the operating gross margin of 10 cents per litre, the recoverable amount of the Lubricants unit would equal its carrying amount.
If the sales volume assumption changes by 5%, the Lubricants units value in use changes by $1.1 billion and, if there is an adverse change in Lubricants sales volumes of 600 million litres, the recoverable amount of the Lubricants unit would equal its carrying amount.
A change of 1% in the discount rate would change the Lubricants units value in use by $0.7 billion and, if the discount rate increases to 17%, the value in use of the Lubricants unit would equal its carrying amount.
