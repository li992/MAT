Statement of Directors Responsibilities United Kingdom company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed: and prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for ensuring that proper accounting records are kept which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and the group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for the system of internal control and for safeguarding the assets of the group and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
