Legal proceedings Investec is party to various legal proceedings, the ultimate resolution of which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the group.
Investec Bank UK Ltd Bank has received a claim in relation to a loan book sold to another institution in 2000.
Proceedings have not yet been issued.
The directors have obtained legal advice, which is ongoing.
The directors consider that even if a claim is brought and is successful, it will be within the Banks existing provisions and or any exposure in excess of that will not have a material adverse effect on the position of the Bank.
Furthermore, if the claim is successful in whole or in part, the Bank may in turn have a claim against its professional advisors and or insurers.
Following falls in the value of assets in the split capital investment trust sector, Carr Sheppards Crosthwaite Limited CSC, in common with other firms in the industry, has received a number of complaints.
Each complaint has been investigated in accordance with CSCs complaints procedures and within guidelines set by the applicable regulatory authority.
A number of complaints are still in the process of adjudication by the Financial Ombudoman service.
Meanwhile in December 2004 a group of firms, of which CSC is not a member, have together agreed to make a contribution of 194 million towards the settlement of claims received to date.
A reliable estimate cannot yet be made of any compensation payable by CSC in respect of this issue.
As part of the arrangement for the sale of CSC to Rensburg plc, Investec 1 Limited has indemnified Rensburg plc for any loss CSC incurs in relation to this matter.
