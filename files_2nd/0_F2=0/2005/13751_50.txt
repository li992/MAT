During the year ended 31 March 2005, US$1 million of this provision was further utilised in regard to costs associated with SAB Ltds previously disposed of remaining retail interests.
The residual US$21 million relates mainly to the disposal of OK Bazaars 1929 Ltd to Shoprite Holdings Ltd Shoprite.
As disclosed in previous annual reports, a number of claims were made by Shoprite in relation to the valuation of the net assets of OK Bazaars at the time of the sale and for alleged breaches by SAB Ltd of warranties contained in the sale agreements.
These claims are being contested by SAB Ltd and have been submitted for dispute resolution to independent accountants acting as experts and not as arbitrators.
In March 2000 an opinion was received from the experts but subsequent to that year end Shoprite instituted action against the independent experts and SABMiller indicating an intention to refute the expert opinion.
While full provision for all claims has already been made on the basis of prudence, the actual outcome of the dispute cannot be estimated by the directors at this time.
The further information ordinarily required by FRS 12 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets has not been disclosed on the grounds that it can be expected to seriously prejudice the outcome of the dispute.
