RECONCILING ITEMS BETWEEN UK GAAP AND IFRS IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements a Share of Results of Joint Ventures and Associated Undertakings Under UK GAAP, the Groups share of operating results, interest and taxation of equity accounted joint ventures and associates was reported separately within the appropriate sub-total of the Groups profit and loss account.
IAS 1 requires the Group to report its post-tax share of results from joint ventures and associated undertakings as single line items at the pre-tax profit level.
b Current Liabilities IAS 1 requires liabilities due to be settled within one year of the balance sheet date to be classified as current liabilities.
At the transition date the Group reclassified 0.4m of amounts reported as provisions for liabilities and charges under UK GAAP into current liabilities under IFRS.
This reclassification amounted to 0.5m as at 31st December 2004. c Dividends Under UK GAAP, the dividend charge was recognised in the profit and loss account whereas, under IFRS, the dividend charge is recognised directly in reserves.
IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance The Groups accounting policy under UK GAAP was to set up a deferred income balance in respect of capital grants receivable.
Releases from deferred income were credited to the profit and loss account over the estimated useful life of the asset to which the grant related.
UK company law prohibited setting off such balances against the asset to which the grant related.
IAS 20 allows both methods and UK company law has been changed to allow the latter method.
The Group changed its accounting policy under IFRS and with effect from the date of transition such unamortised grants were set against the carrying value of the asset to which they relate.
The Groups deferred income balance at 1st January 2004 of 15.9m was set against the carrying value of the associated assets.
The appropriate figure offset was 15.4m at 31st December 2004.
IAS 38 Intangible Assets Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for software that is not an integral part of the computer hardware on which it runs as fixed tangible assets.
IAS 38 requires that such software is separately identified and is categorised as intangible assets.
The net book value transferred in respect of such assets was 2.3m at 1st January 2004 and 3.5m at 31st December 2004.
These figures include assets in the course of completion.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment The Group operates share-based payment schemes under which options or shares are granted to certain employees.
Under UK GAAP, the Group recognised an expense in its profit and loss account in relation to shares awarded under its LTIP but no such expense was recognised in respect of the Group Save As You Earn Scheme SAYE.
Under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, the Group is required to record an expense for all share-based payments granted after 7th November 2002 based on the fair value of those payments as determined at the date of grant.
IAS 12 Income Taxes has been amended to permit an entity to recognise a deferred tax asset in relation to its share-based payment expense to the extent that it is able to obtain a tax deduction upon exercise of the equity instruments granted.
The Groups charge under UK GAAP for LTIP shares up to 1st January 2004 of 0.3m has been reversed, together with the related deferred tax asset of 0.1m.
The charge up to 1st January 2004 under IFRS was calculated at less than 0.1m and the deferred tax asset was 0.1m.
The Groups IFRS 2 charge for the year ended 31st December 2004 was calculated at 0.3m.
This charge represented 0.2m for LTIP shares previously 0.3m under UK GAAP and 0.1m for the Groups SAYE scheme.
The Group recognised a deferred tax asset of 0.3m at 31st December 2004.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations IFRS 3 prohibits the amortisation of goodwill and requires positive goodwill to be carried at cost on the balance sheet subject to an initial impairment test at the date of transition and annual reviews for impairment thereafter.
Under UK GAAP, the Groups policy was to amortise goodwill over a maximum of 20 years, except for goodwill arising prior to 1999 in which case goodwill was written off immediately against reserves and negative goodwill was included as a capital reserve.
The Group purchased 50% of the issued share capital of Multi-Link Terminals Limited at the end of 2004.
Goodwill on this acquisition is not amortised under IFRS.
In the results for the year to 31st December 2004, a charge of 23,000 for goodwill was reversed.
Under UK GAAP, the annualised charge for goodwill on this acquisition would have been 0.4m.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 99 APPENDIX I CONTINUED EXPLANATION OF RECONCILING ITEMS BETWEEN UK GAAP AND IFRS continued IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date Under IAS 10, accrued dividends are not recognised unless the amount has been formally approved as at the balance sheet date.
The Groups accrued dividends of 11.0m as at 1st January 2004 and 12.1m as at 31st December 2004 have been reversed in the restated balance sheets.
Accrued dividends payable by a Group company to the minority interest equity holder of 1.5m at 1st January 2004 and 1.5m at 31st December 2004 have also been reversed.
IAS 12 Income Taxes IAS 12 requires that full provision for deferred tax should be made for all taxable temporary differences where the tax base cost differs from the associated carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities.
UK GAAP specified a partial provision approach under which there was no requirement to provide for deferred tax on timing differences which arose on the revaluation of non-monetary assets unless the company had a binding contract to sell the revalued asset and the gain or loss on the disposal had already been recognised.
Neither was there a requirement to provide for deferred tax on gains made on the disposal of assets that had subsequently been rolled over into replacement assets.
On transition to IFRS as at 1st January 2004 the Group has booked deferred tax on revaluation gains of 9.0m and on gains rolled over into replacement assets arising from insurance claims of 1.1m.
The Group does not expect the deferred tax provisions made on revalued assets and gains rolled over into replacement assets to crystallise in the near future and expects that cash payable in respect of corporation tax will be similar to that under UK GAAP-derived computations.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits Under UK GAAP, the Group accounted for its pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
Pension contributions were charged principally at a rate calculated by the Groups actuary to provide, over the expected service lives of current employees, for all retirement benefits related to projected final salaries and wages.
The assets and liabilities of the Groups pension schemes were not consolidated in the Group balance sheet.
In addition, the Group complied with the transitional arrangements for the adoption of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
This involved showing the Groups pension schemes assets and liabilities as a note to the accounts, including details of the schemes actuarial gains and losses to date.
The Group would have complied with the progressive requirements for adoption of FRS 17 in the year ending 31st December 2005, which would have included recognising the schemes deficits in the Groups balance sheet and taking all actuarial gains and losses to reserves.
Retrospective adoption of IAS 19 requires that the retirement benefit plan deficits were recognised in the balance sheet of the sponsoring entity at 1st January 2004.
The deferred tax asset recognised in respect of the net liability on the Group pension schemes was recognised as a non-current asset instead of being netted off against the deficit.
IAS 19 also requires that full provision for accrued holiday pay was made at each balance sheet date.
The adoption of IAS 19 increased the current service cost for the year ended 31st December 2004 in respect of pension expense from 4.1m under UK GAAP to 4.6m under IFRS.
Under UK GAAP, the Group had built up substantial SSAP 24 prepayments.
On adoption of IFRS at 1st January 2004 pension prepayments of 11.7m were written back and the deferred tax on the prepayment of 3.5m was also reversed.
At 31st December 2004 16.5m was written back less related deferred tax.
By recognising the net liability position on the Groups pension schemes, the Group reported a net liability of 26.7m together with an associated deferred tax asset of 8.0m at 1st January 2004.
The figures at 31st December 2004 were a net liability of 22.5m and an associated deferred tax asset of 6.7m.
The requirement to accrue for holiday pay due at 1st January 2004 increased current liabilities by 0.4m less the associated tax effect.
The accrual at 31st December 2004 was 0.4m less tax.
The Group also recognised its share of an associated companys pension scheme deficit by reducing its investment in associates by 2.2m at 1st January 2004 and by 2.3m at 31st December 2004.
100 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 IAS 40 Investment Property Under UK GAAP the Groups accounting policy was in line with SSAP 19 Accounting for Investment Properties.
Such properties were carried at open market value and it was not permitted to carry them at depreciated historical cost.
Under IAS 40 an entity can choose whether to carry investment property with certain exceptions at either depreciated cost or use a fair value model.
If an entity adopts the fair value model, changes in an assets fair value are recognised as gains or losses in the income statement under IFRS whereas SSAP 19 requires that such movements are to be recognised in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses unless it is a permanent deficit or the reversal thereof in which case it is recognised in the profit and loss account.
The Group reclassified tenanted land and buildings held under UK GAAP as investment property under IFRS.
Under UK GAAP the Group revalued its tenanted land and buildings on a five year programme with an interim valuation after three years.
The Group carried out an interim revaluation on its tenanted land and buildings and investment property at 31st December 2003.
Tenanted buildings were depreciated on their revalued amount over the expected remaining useful life of the building.
The fair value model has been adopted for all investment property.
The Group reclassified its assets held as tenanted land and buildings under UK GAAP as investment property under IFRS.
The assets transferred had a net book value of 108.4m under UK GAAP.
Depreciation charged on revalued tenanted buildings of 0.4m for the year ended 31st December 2004 was reversed.
The appropriate entries to move revaluation surplus on the Groups investment property and tenanted land and buildings from revaluation reserve to retained earnings were made.
The Groups share of a temporary revaluation deficit in a joint venture company of 7.3m as at 1st January 2004 was taken to revaluation reserve under UK GAAP.
This was transferred to retained earnings to comply with the IFRS treatment.
The Groups share of a joint venture companys revaluation uplift of its investment property as at 31st December 2004 amounting to 12.3m was reported within the income statement.
The Group does not consider that there was a material movement in the valuation of its other investment property between 1st January 2004 and 31st December 2004.
SIC 15 Operating Leases Incentives Under UK GAAP the Group complied with UITF 28 Operating Lease Incentives which required lease incentives to be spread over the shorter of the lease term and the period to the first rent review.
However, SIC 15 requires the same treatment for all incentives for the agreement of a new or renewed operating lease, regardless of their form or cash flow effect.
The incentives are recognised as a reduction of the rental income over the entire lease term on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic basis is appropriate, in order to ensure the income statement reflects the true effective rental charge irrespective of the particular cash flow arrangements agreed.
There was a small increase of 0.1m to the Groups retained profit as at 1st January 2004.
The effect on results was to decrease Group profit by 40,000 in the year to 31st December 2004 tax effect immaterial.
There was also an increase in a joint venture companys retained earnings of 0.7m and 1.0m at 1st January and 31st December 2004 respectively with the movement of 0.3m for 31st December 2004 being included in the income statement under share of results of joint ventures.
There was no tax effect resulting from these adjustments as the joint venture company had unutilised tax losses.
Cash Flow Statement The only differences to the Group Cash Flow Statement as a result of the adoption of IFRS were presentational.
Accordingly, no table of these adjustments has been reprinted.
Reconciliation between IFRS and UK GAAP The comparative financial information for 2004 as presented in these financial statements was previously reported under UK GAAP and has since been restated to comply with IFRS subsequent to the transition to IFRS on 1st January 2004.
On 12th August 2005, the Group published detailed reconciliations of the restatements together with the Groups accounting policies.
This information is also available on the Groups website www.
Since the publication of this information the Group has completed the restatement of its 2004 financial statements, which has resulted in an adjustment to Minority Interest and Payables due within one year of 1.5m at 1st January 2004 and 31st December 2004 to comply with the provisions of IAS 10.
The Group has since then also received information on the effect of transition to IFRS from one of its associated companies.
This has resulted in an adjustment to reflect the Groups share of the deficit on the associates defined benefit pension scheme of 2.2m at 1st January 2004 and 2.3m at 31st December 2004 net of deferred tax.
An adjustment has been made to reflect the Groups share of the associates cash flow hedge reserve of 0.1m at 1st January 2005.
Following clarification of the taxation treatment of the revaluation of investment property, the Group has increased its deferred tax provision by 1.3m at 1st January 2004.

Under IAS 32 and IAS 39, the Company is obliged to value its ZCLS at amortised cost.
As a result, the Groups share of its investment in joint ventures has increased by 11.2m at 1st January 2005, with a corresponding increase to retained earnings.
The difference between the historic cost and amortised cost of the ZCLS, being the effective interest on the loans, is recognised as a finance cost in the joint venture companys Income Statement over the period up to which the loan is repaid, and will be part of the Groups share of results of joint ventures.
Ocean Terminal also has an interest rate swap that is used to hedge against interest rate fluctuations.
Under IAS 32 and IAS 39 the Company must record the swap at fair value.
The Group has reduced the value of its investment in joint ventures by 1.7m and has set up a cash flow hedge reserve in the same amount.
Future movements in the fair value of this hedge will flow through the SORIE.
Investment in associates Since the publication of the balance sheet reconciliation from 31st December 2004 to 1st January 2005, the Group has received information on the effect of IAS 32 and IAS 39 from one of its associated companies.
TCS has an interest rate swap that is used to hedge against interest rate fluctuations.
Under IAS 32 and IAS 39 the associate must record the swap at fair value.
The Group has reduced the value of its investment in associates by 0.1m and has recognised the same amount in its cash flow hedge reserve.
Further movements in the fair value of this hedge will flow through the SORIE.
Trade and other receivables The Group must record its long-term receivables at amortised cost under IAS 32 and IAS 39.
At 1st January 2005, the Group has reduced the value of such receivables by 5.0m and retained earnings have been reduced by the same amount.
Non-current assets have been reduced by 4.1m and current assets by 0.9m.
The difference between historic cost and amortised cost, being the effective interest on the long-term receivables, is recognised in finance income over the period up to which the trade receivable is settled.
Since publication of the balance sheet reconciliation from 31st December 2004 to 1st January 2005, the taxation treatment of such adjustments has been clarified and accordingly the Group has reduced its current tax liabilities by 1.5m.
The minority interest share of the IAS 32 and IAS 39 adjustments has been allocated accordingly.
The Group has also reduced the ZCLS it holds in Ocean Terminal Limited to amortised cost.
This has reduced the value of trade and other receivables by 11.2m with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings.
The difference between historic cost and amortised cost, being the effective interest on the ZCLS, is recognised in finance income over the period up to which the ZCLS is repaid.
