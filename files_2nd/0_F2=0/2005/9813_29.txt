For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the weighted average market price of the Company's shares during the period.
Supplementary earnings per share figures are presented.
These exclude the effects of goodwill amortisation and exceptionals.
