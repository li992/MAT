The Containers scheme was established in 2004 following the acquisition of Linpac Containers and assumed the pension obligations and related pension scheme assets of relevant employees of Linpac Containers through a bulk transfer.
The Group contributed 10m to the Group scheme in 2004 05 and has agreed to contribute 14m per annum to the Group scheme from 1 May 2005.
The Group contributed 0.2m to the Containers scheme and expects to make broadly similar contributions in the future.
The Group operates various local pension arrangements for overseas operations and unfunded arrangements for senior executives: these are, in aggregate, not significant to the Group.
A charge over certain assets of the Group has been made as security for certain of the unfunded arrangements.
The financial information given below includes amounts related to these other arrangements, where appropriate.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Group scheme was at 5 April 2004, which has been updated to 30 April 2005 by a qualied independent actuary.
The Containers scheme was valued for the purpose of the bulk transfer described above and this valuation has been updated to 30 April 2005 by a qualied independent actuary.
All valuations used the projected unit method.
Both the Group scheme and the Containers scheme are closed to new entrants: because of this, the average age of the active members is likely to increase at future valuations and this will lead to an increasing current service contribution rate.
This may be offset by a falling total pensionable salary resulting from leavers and retirements.
The principal assumptions made by the actuary were as follows.
These assumptions have been applied to both the Group and Containers schemes.
2005 2004 2003 % % % Discount rate for plan liabilities 5.3% 5.7% 5.4% Ination 2.6% 2.9% 2.5% Rate of general increase in salaries 3.6% 4.2% 4.0% Rate of increase in pensions 2.6% 2.9% 2.5% The assets of the schemes and the expected long-term rates of return were: 2005 2004 2003 Expected rates Expected rates Expected rates of return Market value of return Market value of return Market value %m %m %m Equities 7.5% 392.2 7.9% 342.5 7.2% 294.5 Bonds, Gilts and Cash weighted average 4.3% 167.1 4.7% 147.0 4.4% 132.4 Total market value of assets 559.3 489.5 426.9 Present value of scheme liabilities 674.1 567.6 560.9 deficit in the scheme 114.8 78.1 134.0 Related deferred tax asset 34.5 23.4 40.2 Net pension liability 80.3 54.7 93.8 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The schemes assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and their fair value may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present value of the schemes liabilities is derived from cashow projections over long time periods and thus is inherently uncertain.

The pre-tax discount rate used in assessing the cash ows of the subsidiary involved was 10%.
The reversal of a previous impairment of an associate is explained in note 15.
Exceptional restructuring costs of 1.6m are included within cost of sales.
Exceptional restructuring costs of 3.3m, impairment of goodwill of 5.8m and amortisation of intangibles of 9.8m are included within administrative expenses in operating expenses.
The reversal of a previous impairment of an associate of 1.1m and amortisation of negative goodwill of associates of 0.4m are included in the share of operating profits of associated undertakings.

DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2005 53 11 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the financial year of 38.9m 2004: 43.6m by the weighted average number of shares in issue and fully paid during the year of 385.3m 2004: 348.2m.
The number of shares excludes the weighted average number of the Companys own shares held by the General Employee benefit Trust see note 26 of 2.5m 2004: 1.5m.
The Directors believe that the presentation of an adjusted earnings per share, being the basic earnings per share adjusted for exceptional items and amortisation of intangibles, helps to explain the underlying performance of the Group.

The Companys profit and loss account includes an amount of 126.6m 2004: 126.6m which is considered non-distributable.
i Prior year adjustments are explained below: a Adoption of FRS 17 The charge as a result of the adoption of FRS 17 relative to the charge that would have arisen under SSAP 24 has resulted in a decrease of operating costs of 3.9m 2004: increase of 13.4m and an increase in other finance income of 1.4m 2004: decrease of 3.2m, a decrease in the tax charge of 1.6m 2004: 5.0m, an increase in profit for the year of 3.7m 2004: decrease of 11.6m and a decrease in total gains and losses of 21.7m 2004: increase of 43.7m.
In addition, the adoption of FRS 17 had the following balance sheet effects at 30 April 2004: it reduced prepayments in debtors by 15.0m: it reduced deferred taxes in provisions by 4.5m: and included a pension liability net of deferred taxes of 54.7m.
b Adoption of UITF 38 The adoption of UITF Abstract 38 has given rise to a prior year adjustment to the opening profit and loss account of 2.4m shown as a 2.8m reduction of reserves under own shares and and a 0.4m addition, under other, included in the 64.8m amount above.
This represents: the deduction of the gross cost of shares of 2.8m from the profit and loss account, shown separately as own shares in the table above: and the reversal of a provision of 0.4m charged through the profit and loss account in 1999 to recognise an impairment in the carrying value of own shares held by the General Employee benefit Trust.
The gross cost of the shares less the provision was previously recorded in investments.
