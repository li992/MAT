Inchcape plc 64 Annual report and accounts 2005 Notes to the accounts continued 5 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of pension and post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees in a number of its subsidiaries.
The principal funds are held in the UK and are final salary defined benefit pension schemes.
Most of the schemes have assets held in trust in separately administered funds although there are some minor unfunded arrangements relating to post-retirement health and medical plans in respect of past employees.
There are no material defined contribution schemes in the UK.
The majority of the overseas defined benefit schemes are final salary schemes which provide a lump sum on retirement, some of which have assets held in trust in separately administered funds and others which are unfunded.
The overseas defined contribution schemes are principally linked to local statutory arrangements.
a UK schemes The UK has four main defined benefit schemes, namely the Inchcape Group UK Pension Scheme, the Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme, the Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme and the TKM Group Pension Scheme.
These schemes are considered below: i Open schemes Inchcape Group UK Pension Scheme The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out at 31 March 2003 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
The majority of the schemes liabilities are for pensioners and deferred pensioners, and therefore the investment strategy is to hold c. 45.0% of the schemes assets in equities and c. 55.0% in bonds.
Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out at 5 April 2003 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
Whilst a majority of the schemes members are pensioners and deferred pensioners, a sizeable portion of the membership is still accruing benefits and the investment strategy reflects this with c. 70.0% of the assets invested in equities.
Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme This scheme is managed from Guernsey and is therefore reported in the UK segment in this note.
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out at 1 April 2003 and was determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
A significant majority of the schemes members are pensioners and deferred pensioners and therefore the majority of the assets are invested in bonds.
ii Closed scheme TKM Group Pension Scheme Following changes to pension legislation which introduced new powers to seek additional funding from the sponsoring group, the TKM Group Pension Scheme was included on the Groups balance sheet as from 31 December 2004.
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this closed scheme was carried out at 5 April 2004 on a market related basis and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
The scheme has a prudent investment strategy.
As at 5 April 2004, the scheme had only 0.9% invested in equities with the remainder invested in bonds.
Approximately half the members are pensioners and half are deferred pensioners and as such no further pension accrual arises.
b Overseas schemes There are a number of smaller defined benefit schemes overseas, the most significant being the Inchcape Motors Limited Retirement Scheme in Hong Kong.
In general these schemes offer a lump sum on retirement with no further obligation to the employee.
These schemes are typically subject to triennial valuations.
c Defined contribution plans The total expense recognised in the income statement is 2.4m 2004 2.1m.
Outstanding contributions to defined contribution schemes are nil 2004 0.1m.
Inchcape plc Annual report and accounts 2005 65 5 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued d Defined benefit plans As the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are in the UK, these have been reported separately to the overseas schemes.
For the purposes of reporting, actuarial updates have been obtained for the Groups material schemes and these updates are reflected in the amounts reported below.
The principal weighted average assumptions used by the actuaries were: United Kingdom Overseas 2005 2004 2005 2004 % % % % Rate of increase in salaries 4.7 4.7 4.7 4.7 Rate of increase in pensions 2.7 2.7 1.7 1.6 Discount rate 4.8 5.3 4.4 3.9 Inflation 2.7 2.7 0.7 0.7 Expected return on plan assets 5.4 5.6 6.3 6.5 The rate of increase in healthcare cost is 4.5% 2004 4.7% per annum but with higher increases in the first ten years.
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on published statistics and experience.
For the UK schemes, the average life expectancy of a pensioner retiring at age 65 is 20.5 years 2004 19.9 years for current pensioners and 22.0 years 2004 20.5 years for current non pensioners.
Most of the overseas schemes only offer a lump sum on retirement and therefore mortality assumptions are not applicable.
The expected return on plan assets is based on the weighted average expected return on each type of asset principally equities and bonds.
The overall expected return on plan assets is determined based on expected real rates of return on equities and expected yields on bonds applicable to the period over which the obligation is to be settled.

The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2005 2004 m m UK Retail 43.5 34.6 Singapore 14.2 13.0 Inchcape Automotive Limited 19.5 Other 5.8 4.4 63.5 71.5 Goodwill additions in 2005 arise mainly from the acquisition of six Mercedes-Benz dealerships in the UK note 27.
Goodwill is now subject to impairment testing at least annually, or more frequently where there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates, expected changes to costs and selling prices during the period and the continuing relationship with key brand partners.
Management estimates discount rates using the weighted average cost of capital of the Group, adjusted for any risks specific to the CGUs.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management for the next three years.
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated based on estimated growth rates that do not exceed the long term growth rate for the relevant market.
UK Retail UK Retail CGUs are defined as contiguous territories by marque.
Forecast cash flows for UK Retail, discounted at a pre-tax rate of 11.5%, are based on growth rates generally in excess of 4.5% for the first three years, and thereafter are based on the long term growth rate of the local economy of 2.6%.
Singapore In Singapore, forecast cash flows reflect the anticipated softening of the vehicle market to more normalised levels level driven by reducing fiscal incentives in the region.
The cash flows, discounted at a pre-tax rate of 10.8%, are still however substantially in excess of the carrying amount of the assets of the business.
The long term growth rate applied is based upon the long term growth rate of the local economy of 2.0%.
Inchcape Automotive Limited The forecast cash flows for the business show limited growth due to the continuing challenging market conditions and industry over capacity.
These cash flows at 31 December 2005, which have been discounted at a pre-tax rate of 11.5%, did not support the carrying amount of the goodwill held by the Group and the full balance has been written off.
The impairment charge of 19.5m is included within exceptional items in the income statement.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets principally comprise computer software.
The amortisation charge is largely included within administrative expenses in the income statement.
Other intangible assets also include customer contracts and back orders recognised on the acquisition of a business.
These intangible assets are recognised at the fair value attributable to them on acquisition, and are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful life usually up to one year.
These assets are included in vehicles subject to residual value commitments in the table above.

The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of 25.6m 2004 25.0m that may improve the tax rate in future years.
The majority of these relate to losses, mainly arising in the UK, with the balance relating to accelerated capital allowances and other short term timing differences.
These assets are not recognised because they arise in statutory entities that are currently not forecast to make taxable profits.
There are further potential deferred tax assets, relating to losses, of 14.0m 2004 14.0m that are not recognised and are not considered to have any impact on the future tax charge because the possibility of accessing them is considered remote.
These assets will only become recognisable if the relevant companies which hold them generate sufficient taxable profits.
Of the unrecognised deferred tax assets that relate to tax losses, 6.5m 2004 5.5m relate to restricted tax losses, the majority of which will not expire until after 2010.
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of 69.0m 2004 69.0m in relation to capital losses in addition to the unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to the tax losses noted above.
There are also losses in Belgium for which an asset of 1.4m 2004 1.7m has been recognised, based on current forecast profits.
A further asset of nil 2004 0.4m will only become recognisable if the relevant company which holds the losses generates sufficient taxable profits.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The Group continually reinvests the earnings, or has plans to remit them and no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
If the earnings were remitted, tax of 20.3m 2004 16.5m would be payable.

18 Derivative financial instruments The Group has elected to apply the exemption available under IFRS 1 not to present comparative information, and to apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 prospectively from 1 January 2005.
Accordingly, the 2004 comparatives have been presented in accordance with the UK GAAP standard FRS 13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures note 23.
An outline of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by the Group in relation to financial instruments in general is set out in the Treasury management and policy section of the Financial review.
The Groups derivative financial instruments comprise the following: Assets Liabilities At 31 December 2005 m m Forward foreign exchange contracts 2.1 12.6 The Group principally uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge purchases in a non-functional currency against movements in exchange rates.
The cash flows relating to these contracts are generally expected to occur within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
The nominal principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts relating to transactional exposures at 31 December 2005 are 569.1m.
Net fair value gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in shareholders equity note 25 on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2005 are expected to be released to the income statement within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at their fair values.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps represents the difference between the value of the outstanding contracts at their contracted rates and a valuation calculated using the spot rates of exchange prevailing at 31 December 2005.

Therefore although the UK cash balances are managed on a pooled basis and interest is charged or earned on a net basis, as there is no intention to settle net, this has resulted in a gross up of cash and cash equivalents and borrowings in 2005.
Cash and cash equivalents are generally subject to floating interest rates determined by reference to short term benchmark rates applicable in the relevant currency or market primarily LIBOR or the local equivalent.
At 31 December 2005 the weighted average floating rate was 4.0%.
At 31 December 2005, short term bank deposits have a weighted average period to maturity of twenty-seven days.

Management considers the carrying amount of trade and other payables to approximate to their fair value.
Long term payables have been discounted where the time value of money is considered to be material.

These are not separable products.
The warranty periods covered are up to six years and or specific mileage limits.
Provision is made for the expected cost of labour and parts based on historical claims experience and expected future trends.
These assumptions are reviewed regularly.
Motors business exits This provision relates to business exits that are expected to be largely completed over the next two years.
Non-motors business exits Provision has been made for warranties, indemnities and other litigation issues in relation to these exits, based on expected outcomes.
During the year the Group came to a final settlement of the legal claims made by AON Corporation under an indemnity given in connection with the sale of Bain Hogg Limited in 1996.
Any detailed disclosure of the Groups outstanding claims could seriously prejudice negotiations.
Accordingly, no information is given in regard to the likely timing or cash impact as normally required under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Vacant leasehold The Group is committed to certain leasehold premises for which it no longer has a commercial use.
These are principally located in the UK.
Provision has been made to the extent of the estimated future net cost.
This includes taking into account existing subtenant arrangements.
The expected utilisation period of these provisions is generally over the next ten years.
Other This category includes provision for the cost of implementing new European Block Exemption contracts throughout the dealer network in Belgium and a number of litigation provisions in respect of the exit of certain motor business dealerships.
These are generally expected to be settled within the next three years.

Therefore, although the UK cash balances are managed on a pooled basis and interest is charged or earned on a net basis, as there is no intention to settle net, this has resulted in a gross up of cash and cash equivalents and borrowings.
Interest payments on floating rate financial liabilities are determined by reference to short term benchmark rates applicable in the relevant currency or market primarily LIBOR or the local equivalent.
The fair values of the Groups borrowings are not considered to be materially different from their book value.
As in 2004, the Groups borrowings are unsecured.
In July 2005, the Group amended its principal committed borrowing facility of 250.0m with a syndicated committed borrowing facility of 275.0m.
The maturity of this facility has been extended for a further five years to 2010, with the option of a further extension to 2012.
As at year end there were no drawings made under this facility.
In addition, the relationship banks have made available uncommitted borrowing facilities, which are used for liquidity management purposes.
The table below sets out the maturity profile at 31 December 2005 of the Groups borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk.

The transitional provisions of IFRS 1 require the presentation of one year of comparative information, but this information need not comply with IAS 32 and IAS 39.
The information disclosed below is therefore presented under the UK GAAP standard FRS 13, although the underlying numbers have been adjusted from those previously reported under UK GAAP to comply with all IFRS applicable for 2004.
The main adjustments that would be required to give effect to IAS 32 and IAS 39 would be the recognition of a number of assets and liabilites including derivatives at their fair value on the balance sheet and the removal of the short term receivables and payables exemption that was permitted under FRS 13.
For the purposes of the disclosures which follow in this note, short term receivables and payables which arise directly from the Groups operations have been excluded as permitted under the terms of FRS 13.
The disclosures therefore focus on those financial instruments which play a significant medium to long term role in the financial risk profile of the Group.
a Interest rate management i The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the Group at 31 December 2004 is set out in the table below: Fixed rate Weighted Weighted average On which average period for no interest interest which rate Floating rate Fixed rate is paid Total rate is fixed Currency m m m m % Years Sterling 10.5 2.414.927.87.580 Euro 0.4 0.1 10.310.87.0 4 Other 4.2 2.4 6.6 15.1 2.5 27.6 45.2 7.5 77 Interest payments on floating rate financial liabilities are determined by reference to short term benchmark rates applicable in the relevant currency or market primarily LIBOR and the euro.
The financial liabilities on which no interest is paid mainly comprise 15.6m of residual buy back commitments which have a weighted average period to maturity of twenty-two months and 4.7m of vacant leasehold property provisions which have a weighted average period to maturity of six years.

c Fair values There were no material differences between the book value and fair value of the Groups assets and liabilities other than the forward foreign exchange contracts on transactional exposures which had a book value of nil and a fair value liability of 8.3m, and other investments which had a book value of 14.6m and a fair value of 15.4m at 31 December 2004.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts of 8.3m represents the difference between the value of the outstanding contracts at their contracted rates and a valuation calculated using the spot rates of exchange prevailing at 31 December 2004.
At 31 December 2004 the Group had nominal amounts outstanding of 419.6m for these contracts, used principally to hedge future purchases in foreign currency.
The fair value of other investments is based upon their traded market value.

The principal impact of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 at 1 January 2005 relates to the accounting for derivative financial instruments.
Under UK GAAP, derivatives taken out to hedge foreign currency exposures generally remained off balance sheet with the associated liability being booked at the forward contract rate.
Under IFRS, the liability is booked at the spot rate and the derivative is initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value with any movement being taken to the income statement unless designated and documented as being a hedge of a highly probable forecast transaction or commitment cash flow hedge, in which case the gain or loss is taken to shareholders equity until the hedged firm commitment affects the income statement.
The impact of these standards has been to reduce shareholders equity by 4.5m at 1 January 2005.

Translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences relating to the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries arising after 1 January 2004.
It is also used to record exchange differences arising on long term foreign currency borrowings used to finance or hedge foreign currency investments.
Hedging reserve For cash flow hedges that meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gains or losses on the hedging instrument that are determined to be an effective hedge are recognised directly in shareholders equity.
When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in shareholders equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.

The provisional fair value of the total net assets acquired was 13.6m, with goodwill arising on these acquisitions of 10.3m.
The consideration paid on acquisition of these businesses reported in the cash flow statement is net of cash and overdrafts acquired of 5.0m.
In addition, during the year the Group paid 0.7m deferred consideration on prior year acquisitions and 1.2m in respect of investments in joint ventures and associates.

In September 2000, the European Parliament passed Directive 2000 53 EC which deals with the collection and disposal of vehicles at the end of their life.
The Directive includes a retrospective liability for vehicles put on the road prior to July 2002.
Member states were required to enact legislation by 21 April 2002.
Legislation has now been enacted in all the Groups core markets in the EU, including the UK.
In Belgium, Finland and Greece there are self-funding arrangements in place with independent companies which will result in a no cost solution for importers.
Accordingly, having reviewed this matter and, based on the information currently available, the Directors consider that the implementation of the Directive will not have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.

Under IFRS 2 and the transitional exemption permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has recognised a charge reflecting the fair value of all outstanding equity settled share-based awards granted to employees after 7 November 2002.
The fair value has been calculated using an option pricing model and is charged to the income statement over the relevant option vesting period.
The impact of this change has been to increase the charge to operating profit by 0.1m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The limited impact of IFRS 2 in 2004 is largely a consequence of the different period over which the deferred bonus plan charge is spread under IFRS versus UK GAAP and the fact that only options granted after 7 November 2002 give rise to a charge under IFRS 2.
The 2004 charge is not necessarily representative of the ongoing impact under IFRS 2.
Goodwill Under UK GAAP, capitalised goodwill was amortised over its useful economic life of up to twenty years and goodwill previously written off to shareholders equity was recycled in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal of a business.
Under IFRS, capitalised goodwill is not amortised but is instead tested at least annually for impairment.
Of the 5.5m amortisation charge for the year ended 31 December 2004 under UK GAAP, 4.2m has been reversed under IFRS with the balance of 1.3m being treated as an impairment of goodwill.
A goodwill impairment charge of 9.4m was charged in the year ended 31 December 2004 as an exceptional item under UK GAAP.
This has been treated in the same way under IFRS.
In addition, goodwill arising on business combinations on or before 31 December 1997 has been deducted from shareholders equity.
This amounted to 114.4m at 1 January 2004 and will not be recycled through the income statement on disposal.
As such, goodwill of 6.0m previously recycled to the income statement on disposal has been reversed for the year ended 31 December 2004.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has chosen to apply IFRS 3 prospectively from 1 January 2004 and has not restated previous business combinations.
Goodwill is therefore stated at 1 January 2004 at its UK GAAP carrying value of 60.9m.
Other intangible assets IAS 38 Intangible Assets requires computer software to be shown as an intangible asset rather than as property, plant and equipment as under UK GAAP.
This has had no impact on the measurement of the asset and the same amortisation policy applies.
This has resulted in a reclassification of 6.2m from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets at 1 January 2004 and 6.3m at 31 December 2004.
IAS 38 and IFRS 3 require intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination to be separately identified from goodwill.
During 2004, the Group acquired various UK dealerships which gave rise to such intangible assets, and this has resulted in a reclassification of 0.8m from goodwill to other intangible assets.
Of this balance, 0.6m had been amortised by 31 December 2004.
Pension and other post-retirement benefits Under UK GAAP, post-retirement benefit schemes were accounted for in line with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs which required defined benefit scheme costs to be included within operating expenses, with variations from the regular cost spread over the expected remaining service lives of employees.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits disclosures were provided in the Financial statements for the Groups major defined benefit schemes, namely those in the UK and Hong Kong.
FRS 17 is broadly similar to IAS 19.
IAS 19 requires separate recognition of the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension schemes in the income statement and permits a number of options for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
The Group has adopted the IFRS 1 transitional exemption and recognised the full actuarial pension deficit in shareholders equity at the date of transition.
The Group has recognised actuarial gains and losses immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense following the amendment made to IAS 19.
The impact of this policy is to recognise an additional pension liability, net of deferred tax, of 40.7m in the Groups IFRS opening balance sheet at 1 January 2004 and 51.6m at 31 December 2004.
The impact of the policy on operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 is a reduction of 1.3m, with a 0.5m decrease in net finance costs, giving a net charge of 0.8m in the income statement.
Inchcape plc Annual report and accounts 2005 97 33 Reconciliations of UK GAAP to IFRS continued Contract hire Under UK GAAP, the profit on the initial sale of vehicles to a leasing company where the Group retained a residual value commitment to the leasing company was recognised immediately.
All vehicles whether they were sourced from within or outside the Group where a residual value commitment existed were included in inventories at the guaranteed repurchase price with the corresponding repurchase liability included in trade and other payables.
Under IAS 18 Revenue, profits arising on the sale of vehicles, sourced from within the Group, for which a Group company retains a residual value commitment, are recognised over the term of the lease.
These vehicles are disclosed as a separate category of asset within property, plant and equipment in the balance sheet with the corresponding liability included in trade and other payables.
This has resulted in a decrease in net assets of 1.3m at 1 January 2004 and 1.2m at 31 December 2004, and an increase in operating profit of 0.1m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
In addition, under UK GAAP, rental income earned from the leasing business which was receivable at the end of the lease was not discounted whereas IFRS requires the time value of money to be reflected in the amount recorded.
This has given rise to a reduction in revenue of 0.5m for the year ended 31 December 2004, offset by the unwind of the discount of 0.8m.
This has resulted in a net credit to the income statement of 0.3m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The associated decrease in trade and other receivables was 0.8m at 1 January 2004 and 0.6m at 31 December 2004.
Property leases Under UK GAAP, property leases covering both land and buildings were treated as a single lease.
Under IAS 17 Leases, the land and buildings element of each lease must be separated with the land element generally treated as an operating lease as it is considered to have an infinite life.
Leasehold land has therefore been reclassified, at historic cost, from property, plant and equipment to trade and other receivables with a reversal of any associated historic revaluation.
This has resulted in a decrease in net assets of 11.8m at 1 January 2004 and 11.2m at 31 December 2004.
The adjustment has decreased the charge to operating profit by 0.3m for the year ended 31 December 2004, reflecting the reduced depreciation charge following the reversal of the revalued element of the asset.
Stock holding interest Under UK GAAP, the cost of supplier related credit is included within operating expenses.
Under IAS 2 Inventories, the cost has been reclassified from operating expenses to finance costs in the income statement.
The amount reclassified was 7.2m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Tax The current tax charge in the income statement and current tax assets and liabilities in the balance sheet are unaffected by IFRS, as the tax payable was based on the relevant local GAAP.
The deferred tax charge in the income statement and deferred tax assets and liabilities in the balance sheet are principally affected by properties that do not qualify for tax allowances, acquired as part of a business combination, and revaluations of property.
The overall impact on the income statement is an increase in the tax charge of 2.0m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The overall impact on the balance sheet is a decrease in net assets of 0.8m and 2.8m at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 respectively.
Dividends Under UK GAAP, proposed dividends were recognised as an adjusting post balance sheet event.
Under IFRS a dividend is only recognised when the shareholders right to receive the payment is established, which in the case of the final dividend is not until they have been approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Therefore under IFRS, the Group will no longer accrue unapproved dividends at period ends.
This has resulted in an increase in net assets of 20.5m at 1 January 2004 and 28.2m at 31 December 2004.
Other The other column in the reconciliations contains a number of minor adjustments none of which is individually material.
