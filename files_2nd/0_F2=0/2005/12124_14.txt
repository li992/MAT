Photo-Me International plc 41 Annual Report 2005 Notes on the accounts for the year ended 30 April 2005 1 Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards UKGAAP.
A summary of the more significant Group accounting policies is set out below.
The accounts for the year-ended 30 April 2006 will be presented under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as noted on page 23.
The Group continued to adopt the transitional arrangement of FRS17 Retirement Benefits.
FRS17 is not fully effective until periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005. b Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings made up to 30 April 2005, together with the appropriate share of the results of associated undertakings and of joint ventures made up to 30 April 2005.
Entities in which the Group holds an interest on a long-term basis and are jointly controlled by the Group and one or more venturers under a contractual arrangement are treated as joint ventures.
In the Group accounts, joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
Entities, other than subsidiary undertakings or joint ventures, in which the Group has a participating interest and over whose operating and financial policies the Group exercises a significant influence are treated as associated undertakings.
In the Group accounts, associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method.
The Group accounts include income from current asset investments as follows: dividend income on a dividend received basis, and other investment income on an accruals basis.
Where the accounts of subsidiary, associated undertakings and joint ventures do not conform with the Groups accounting policies, appropriate adjustments are made on consolidation to prepare the Group accounts on a consistent basis.
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985. c Foreign currencies Group The accounts of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising on the retranslation of opening net assets is taken directly to reserves.
All other translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign enterprises, which are taken directly to reserves together with the exchange difference on the net investment in these enterprises.
Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in reserves.
Company Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward foreign currency contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or if appropriate at the forward contract rate.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign equity investments, which are taken directly to reserves together with the exchange difference on the carrying amount of the related investments.
d Goodwill Goodwill or negative goodwill, which represents the difference between the fair value of net assets acquired and the fair value of the amount paid, is capitalised in the balance sheet as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis over the useful life of the asset with a maximum period of 20 years.
Negative goodwill arising on the acquisition of companies is written back to the profit and loss account evenly over the period in which the non-monetary assets are recovered.
Goodwill relating to acquisitions prior to 1 May 1999 was charged directly to reserves and, in accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS10, has not been restated.
If an undertaking acquired before 1 May 1999 is subsequently divested, the appropriate goodwill is dealt with through the profit and loss account in the period of the disposal as part of the calculation of gain or loss on investment.
e Other intangible assets Research and development expenditure is written-off in the year in which it is incurred where the commercial viability of the item being developed is uncertain.
Development expenditure relating to a specific project is carried forward when its future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured.
Intellectual property, such as acquired patents and licenses, is capitalised as an intangible asset.
Notes on the accounts 42 Photo-Me International plc Annual Report 2005 1 Accounting policies continued f Amortisation and depreciation Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis to write-off the assets at the following rates: Goodwill over the estimated life of the asset with a maximum period of 20 years: Development expenditure amortised in line with the expected future sales from the related project, with a maximum period of 4 years following commercial production: Intellectual property over the estimated life of the asset with a maximum period of 20 years.
Depreciation is charged on either a straight line basis or on a reducing balance basis to reduce the cost of tangible fixed assets to their net realisable values over their estimated useful lives at the following rates: Freehold land nil Freehold buildings 2% 5% straight line Long lease property 2% straight line Short lease property over the lives of the leases on a straight line basis Photobooths, etc.
12.5% 25% straight line or reducing balance g Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill When indicators of impairment exist, the carrying value of intangible and tangible fixed assets is compared to the higher of the value in use and the net realisable value.
If the carrying value exceeds the higher of the value in use and net realisable value, the asset is impaired and its value reduced by charging additional amortisation or depreciation.
h Leased assets Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account, as incurred, over the term of the lease.
An asset acquired under a finance lease agreement is capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its estimated useful life, on a straight line basis.
i Derivatives and other financial instruments Foreign exchange contracts The Group uses forward exchange contracts as part of its strategy to minimise foreign exchange exposure.
Usually such contracts are of a short-term nature and cover foreign currency purchases.
The rates under such contracts are used to record the hedged item.
As a result, gains and losses are off-set against the foreign exchange gains and losses on the related financial assets and liabilities.
Debt instruments Financial instruments, mainly loans, are utilised to raise finance for the Groups trading operations.
Interest on borrowings is charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps are recognised where an instrument changes the character of the interest rate by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa.
Interest differentials are recognised by accruing with net interest payable.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value nor shown on the Group balance sheet at the year end.
If they are terminated early, the gain or loss is spread over the remaining maturity of the original instrument.
j Taxation Corporation tax chargeable on profits assessed to taxation is provided for at current rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
k Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions and events have occurred by that date and which could give rise to an obligation to pay, or right to receive, more or less taxation in the future with the following exceptions: Deferred tax assets are recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be adequate taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted: Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of retained earnings of overseas subsidiary undertakings, associated undertakings and joint ventures only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
Deferred taxation is measured at the tax rate expected to apply in the period in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation balances are not discounted.
l Turnover Turnover comprises the net invoiced value of sales to third parties and the revenue from cash takings in vending companies, stated net of value added tax.
Sales of operating equipment by the Groups Manufacturing division to Group undertakings, which is then capitalised within the accounts of Group undertakings, is excluded from sales as noted in the analysis of turnover Note 2.
Revenue is recognised at the point of sale.
Notes on the accounts Photo-Me International plc 43 Annual Report 2005 m Own work capitalised The Group manufactures vending equipment which is used by Group vending companies.
This is shown in cost of sales as own work capitalised and this figure includes direct costs associated with manufacture and applicable overheads attributable to the Manufacturing facility but excludes general overheads and administration costs.
n Investments Investments are stated in the balance sheet at cost less amounts written-off.
o Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value as follows: Cost incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition: Raw materials and consumables purchase cost on a first-in, first-out basis Work-in-progress and finished goods cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable overheads based on the normal level of activity Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.

q Pension costs Some of the Companys longer serving employees belong to a pension scheme, which is closed to new entrants.
The scheme is funded by both employers and employees contributions and is of the defined benefit type.
The defined benefits are based upon an employees years of service and final pensionable salary.
The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
Actuarial valuations are undertaken at least every 3 years.
Any difference between the cost charged and amounts paid by the Company is treated as a prepayment or accrual.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Company, in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The Company also operates a defined contribution pension scheme for senior employees.
One overseas subsidiary undertaking operates a defined contribution pension schemes for employees.
The profit and loss account is charged with the contributions payable in respect of all such schemes.

It is the opinion of the directors that disclosure of the net assets and of the profit before taxation by activity Manufacturing and Vending, the net assets by geographical analysis and the turnover by geographical analysis by destination, in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 25 Segmental Reporting, would be seriously prejudicial to the interests of the Group.

Non-operating exceptional items 2005 2004 000 000 Profit on disposal of joint venture 358 The non-operating exceptional item for 2004 relates to the profit on disposal of the joint venture, Digital Portal Inc. Notes on the accounts Photo-Me International plc 45 Annual Report 2005 Fire loss On 22 December 2004, the Groups 62,000 sq ft warehouse and workshop building at Bookham was destroyed by fire, together with its contents.
The contents principally comprised minilabs for resale, spare parts and consumables, together classified within stocks, and vending equipment being refurbished, classified as tangible fixed assets.
The Groups head office building, on the same site, was undamaged.
The destroyed building and its contents were adequately insured and the directors are entirely satisfied that no loss will arise, either in relation to the loss of stocks and tangible fixed assets or a loss of profits to the business as a result of the disruption caused.
The Groups insurers have already advanced 10 million on account, in respect of the claim, which supports the directors view that the losses are fully covered.
Furthermore, since the insurance cover is based on replacement cost, a material accounting surplus could arise.
However, as the claim has not been finalised, no gain has been recognised in these accounts.
The cash flows in respect of the insurance receipts and payments in order to re-stock have been recognised in working capital cash flows within the cash flow statement.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares.
The Group has only one category of dilutive potential Ordinary shares: the share options granted to senior staff, including directors, as detailed in Note 20, where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary shares during the year.
The earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculation are set out in the table below: 2005 2004 Number of Earnings Number of Earnings Earnings shares per share Earnings shares per share 000 000 pence 000 000 pence Basic earnings per share Earnings available to Ordinary shareholders 21,720 364,253 5.96 14,558 363,387 4.01 Effect of dilutive securities: Options 3,921 3,613 Diluted earnings per share 21,720 368,174 5.90 14,558 367,000 3.97 Basic earnings available to shareholders 21,720 14,558 Adjustment for exceptional items 816 358 Adjustment for tax on exceptional items 343 Adjustment for goodwill amortisation 676 545 Adjusted earnings available to shareholders 22,869 14,745 Adjusted earnings per share Basic 22,869 364,253 6.28 14,745 363,387 4.06 Diluted 22,869 368,174 6.21 14,745 367,000 4.02 The alternative measure of earnings per share is provided because it reflects the Groups underlying trading performance excluding the effects of goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.

Notes on the accounts Photo-Me International plc 59 Annual Report 2005 25 Pensions The Company and its principal subsidiaries operate pension and other retirement schemes including both defined benefit schemes, whereby retirement benefits are based on the employees final remuneration and length of service, and defined contribution schemes, whereby retirement benefits reflect the accumulated value of agreed contributions paid by, and in respect of, employees.
Defined benefit schemes The Company operates a defined benefit scheme for a few long-serving employees.
This pension scheme the Photo-Me International plc Pension and Life Assurance Fund is closed to new entrants.
Contributions to the scheme are made in accordance with the recommendations of an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the Attained Age method.
The most recent valuation of the scheme was prepared as at 1 June 2003 for the purpose of SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The principal assumptions which have the most significant effect on the valuation were: investment returns on equities of 7.5% per annum, investment returns on gilts bonds of 5% per annum, salary increases of 3.5% per annum, and price inflation of 2.5% per annum.
The market value of the schemes assets at the valuation date was 4,055,000, representing 91% of the value of the aggregate benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in salaries.
The deficit identified above is being recognised over 10 years, being the average remaining service lives of employees.
With agreement from the actuary, the Company will make contributions to the Scheme at 13.1% of pensionable salaries for the year ending 30 April 2006, plus an additional payment of 56,000 2004: 51,000 to reduce the deficit revealed in the actuarial valuation as at 1 June 2003, which is planned to be removed over a 5 year period.
The total pension cost as disclosed in Note 4 amounted to 111,000 2004: 100,000 and included an amount in respect of the amortisation of the deficit in the scheme as at 1 June 2003.
The next actuarial valuation of the scheme is due as at 1 June 2006.
Other retirement provisions Provisions for obligations to make termination payments on retirement, to staff who are not members of the pension and retirement schemes, are included in provisions for liabilities and charges Note 17, as follows: The Groups Japanese subsidiary undertaking, Nippon Auto-Photo K. K. has a retirement provision, based on employees length of service with the company and their current salary.
The allowance is paid to employees when they leave the company.
This has been provided for in full within the accounts.
To meet the legal obligations within France, the Groups subsidiary undertakings have retirement provisions which have been valued by an actuary using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
Following the latest valuation in the year to April 2004, the estimated obligation has been fully provided for within the accounts.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of these obligations is 296,000 2004: 727,000.
Defined contribution schemes The total pension cost for the year for defined contribution schemes as disclosed in Note 4 is reconciled as follows: 2005 2004 000 000 Photo-Me International plc United Kingdom 68 58 Imaging Solutions AG Switzerland 385 441 Total defined contribution expense 453 499 In respect of the Companys United Kingdom defined contribution scheme, 6,000 of contributions were outstanding at 30 April 2005 2004: 5,000.
Disclosures in respect of FRS17 Retirement benefits The above figures have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of SSAP24.
FRS17 Retirement Benefits will replace SSAP 24 for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005.
The accounting requirements of FRS17 are broadly as follows: Pension scheme assets are valued at market values at the balance sheet date Pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit credit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality AA corporate bonds of equivalent term and currency to the liability For accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 the pension scheme surplus to the extent it is considered recoverable or deficit will be recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet: and The movement in the scheme surplus deficit will be split between operating charges, financing items and, in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, actuarial gains and losses.
