34 Transition to IFRS For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2004, the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice UK GAAP.
As noted above in note 2, these financial statements, for the year ended 31 December 2005, are the first the Group is required to prepare in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
Accordingly, the Group has prepared financial statements which comply with IFRS applicable for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and the significant accounting policies meeting those requirements are described in note 2.
In preparing these financial statements the Group has started from an opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2004, the Groups date of transition to IFRS, and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements as required by IFRS 1 for the first-time adoption of IFRS.
This note explains the principal adjustments made by the Group in restating its UK GAAP balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004.
IFRS 1 allows first-time adopters certain exemptions from the general requirement to apply IFRS as effective for December 2005 year-ends retrospectively.
Details of the exemptions taken by the Group are set out in note 2.
Note that comparative information on financial instruments is prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and the Group has adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 January 2005.
Accounting policies applied in the year ended 31 December 2004 As noted above, the Group has adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 with effect from 1 January 2005 and, as permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has not restated comparative information.
The new accounting policies as applied for the year ended 31 December 2005 are set out above in note 2.
For accounting periods up to the year ended 31 December 2004 the following accounting policies were applied in respect of financial instruments in the financial statements of the Group: Derivative financial instruments The Group uses forward currency contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange rates.
The Group also makes use of interest rate swaps to adjust interest rate exposures.
The Group considers its derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting when certain criteria are met.
Forward foreign currency contracts The criteria for forward foreign currency contracts are: the instrument must be related to a rm foreign currency commitment it must involve the same currency as the hedged item and it must reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
The rates under such contracts are used to record the hedged item.
As a result, gains and losses are offset against the foreign exchange gains and losses on the related financial assets and liabilities, or where the instrument is used to hedge a committed future transaction, are not recognised until the transaction occurs.
Interest rate swaps The Groups criteria for interest rate swaps are: the instrument must be related to an asset or liability and it must change the character of the interest rate by converting a variable rate to a xed rate or vice versa.
Interest differentials are recognised by accruing with net interest payable.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value or shown on the Group balance sheet at the year end.
If they are terminated early, the gain or loss is spread over the remaining maturity of the original instrument.

All derivatives would have been brought on to the balance sheet at fair value.
The impact on the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 would be as follows: Comparative had IAS 32 Adjustments to and IAS 39 UK GAAP comply with been adopted 31 December IAS 32 and at 31 December 2004 IAS 39 2004 m m m Financial assets Interest rate swaps 1.4 1.4 Financial liabilities Bonds 124.7 1.7 123.0 Currency swaps 3.1 3.1 Retained earnings Reconciliation of consolidated equity at 1 January 2004 date of transition to IFRS Client Recognise Previous balances Proposed pension Deferred GAAP recognised dividend liability taxation IFRS Notes m m m m m m Property, plant and equipment 111.7 111.7 Intangible assets 451.2 451.2 Available-for-sale financial assets 5.2 5.2 Deferred taxation 1 1.6 25.4 27.0 Total non-current assets 569.7 25.4 595.1 Trade and other receivables 136.1 10.6 146.7 Prepayments 83.3 83.3 Cash and short term deposits 19.8 10.9 30.7 Total current assets 239.2 21.5 260.7 Total assets 808.9 21.5 25.4 855.8 Trade and other payables 95.0 21.5 116.5 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 158.1 158.1 Employee benets 2 10.1 67.7 77.8 Income tax payable 26.1 26.1 Proposed dividends 3 18.0 18.0 Accruals and deferred income 154.8 154.8 Provisions 4.6 4.6 Total liabilities 466.7 21.5 18.0 67.7 537.9 Total assets less total liabilities 342.2 18.0 67.7 25.4 317.9 Issued capital 13.3 13.3 Share premium 242.7 242.7 Capital redemption reserve 0.1 0.1 Retained earnings 86.0 18.0 67.7 25.4 61.7 Equity shareholders funds 342.1 18.0 67.7 25.4 317.8 Minority interest 0.1 0.1 Total equity 342.2 18.0 67.7 25.4 317.9 10697 Capita 2005 back 14 3 06 09:54 Page 93 93 Capita Notes to the consolidated financial statements 34 Transition to IFRS continued Reconciliation of consolidated equity at 31 December 2004 end of last period presented under previous GAAP Intangible assets and RecognitionGoodwill client AmortisationProposed Previous of pension amortisation balances Goodwill of intangible final Deferred GAAP liability added back recognised fide-recognised assets dividend taxation IFRS Notes m m m m m m m m m Property, plant and equipment 129.1 129.1 Intangible assets 1 470.2 29.3 10.1 10.1 1.8 2.5 500.2 Available-for-sale financial assets 0.2 0.2 Trade and other receivables 6.1 6.1 Deferred taxation 2 0.9 33.5 32.6 Total non-current assets 604.7 29.3 10.1 10.1 1.8 36.0 668.2 Trade and other receivables 144.3 17.3 161.6 Prepayments 98.7 98.7 Total current assets 243.0 17.3 260.3 Total assets 847.7 29.3 27.4 10.1 1.8 36.0 928.5 Trade and other payables 87.8 28.2 116.0 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 152.0 152.0 Employee benets 3 43.5 87.6 44.1 Income tax payable 28.4 28.4 Proposed dividends 4 23.8 23.8 Accruals and deferred income 196.1 196.1 Overdrafts 37.0 10.9 26.1 Provisions 5.5 5.5 Total liabilities 487.1 87.6 17.3 23.8 568.2 Total assets less total liabilities 360.6 87.6 29.3 10.1 10.1 1.8 23.8 36.0 360.3 Issued capital 13.4 13.4 Share premium 248.1 248.1 Treasury shares 0.2 0.2 Capital redemption reserve 0.1 0.1 Foreign currency translation 0.1 0.1 Retained earnings 98.7 87.6 29.3 1.8 23.8 36.0 98.4 Equity shareholders funds 360.2 87.6 29.3 1.8 23.8 36.0 359.9 Minority interest 0.4 0.4 Total equity 360.6 87.6 29.3 1.8 23.8 36.0 360.3 10697 Capita 2005 back 14 3 06 09:54 Page 94 94 Capita Notes to the consolidated financial statements 34 Transition to IFRS continued Reconciliation of consolidated profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 fide-recognition recognition Sharebased Goodwill Amortisation Previous Discontinued of pension payment amortisation of intangible Deferred GAAP operations charge charge added back assets taxation IFRS Notes m m m m m m m m Continuing operations: Revenue 1,285.1 2.9 1,282.2 Cost of sales 958.6 3.0 955.6 Gross profit 326.5 0.1 326.6 Administrative expenses 1, 2, 3 195.7 0.2 0.1 4.7 29.3 1.8 172.6 Operating profit 130.8 0.3 0.1 4.7 29.3 1.8 154.0 Finance costs 11.9 11.9 profit before tax 118.9 0.3 0.1 4.7 29.3 1.8 142.1 Income tax expense 4 41.6 2.2 39.4 profit for the year from continuing operations 77.3 0.3 0.1 4.7 29.3 1.8 2.2 102.7 Discontinued operations: Loss on discontinued operations 1.9 0.3 2.2 profit for the year 75.4 0.1 4.7 29.3 1.8 2.2 100.5 Attributable to : Equity holders of the parent 75.6 0.1 4.7 29.3 1.8 2.2 100.7 Minority interest 0.2 0.2 75.4 0.1 4.7 29.3 1.8 2.2 100.5 IFRS UK GAAP adjustments IFRS Earnings per share basic 11.36p 3.77p 15.13p diluted 11.21p 3.79p 15.00p basic excluding discontinued operations 11.69p 3.74p 15.46p diluted excluding discontinued operations 11.54p 3.76p 15.33p Notes to the reconciliations Notes to the reconciliation of consolidated equity at 1 January 2004: 1.
As a first-time adopter of IFRS, the Group has taken advantage of the exception allowed under IFRS 1 not to apply full retrospective application of IAS 19 Employee Benets.
Accordingly, the Group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses at the date of transition to IFRS.
Consequently, the full pension liability of 77.8m at 1 January 2004 is recognised under IFRS but was not fully recognised under previous GAAP.
Proposed dividends are not recognised under IFRS thus the provision of 18.0m has been written back.

Goodwill amortisation under UK GAAP of 29.3m added back.
10.1m of separately identied intangible assets have been recognised in accordance with IFRS 3 IAS 38 fide-recognised in goodwill as has the deferred taxation liability of 2.5m in relation to this.
The deferred taxation liability recognised results in an equal and opposite entry in goodwill.
Amortisation of these separately identiable intangible assets of 1.8m has been charged to the income statement.
As noted above in the reconciliation of equity at 1 January 2004, the full pension liability of 44.1m at 31 December 2004 is recognised under IFRSs but was not fully recognised under previous GAAP.
Proposed dividends are not recognised under IFRS thus the provision of 23.8m has been written back.
One of the principal activities of Capita Financial Managers Limited CFM is to act as an authorised unit trust manager whereby funds are received on behalf of customers to be invested per instruction by CFM.
The transfer of funds to purchase the units is not always done on the same business day.
The Groups transition to IFRS has forced us to re-examine certain funds ow arrangements and we have reached the conclusion that this arrangement should be recorded gross on the Groups consolidated balance sheet.
The impact for the 2004 closing balance sheet was to increase debtors, creditors and cash balance by 17.3m, 28.2m and 10.9m respectively.
The equivalent balances on the 2005 closing balance sheet are 31.1m, 38.0m and 6.9m resulting in timing difference in cash outow of 4.0m for the year.
Notes to the reconciliation of consolidated profit for the year ended 31 December 2004: 1.
The change from accounting for the dened benefit pension schemes under UK GAAP to IFRS has resulted in a reduced charge of 0.1m.
Provision for share based payment of 4.7m is recognised under IFRS 2 but was not recognised under UK GAAP.
Provision made for amortisation of 1.8m on separately identied intangibles.
Deferred taxation has been recognised.
Reconciliation of consolidated cash and cash equivalents for relevant periods: 1.
No restated IFRS cash ow has been presented as there is no difference between the net cash ow presented under IFRSs and the net cash ow presented under the previous GAAP except for the item described in note 5 above.
