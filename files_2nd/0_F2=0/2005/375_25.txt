The convertible bond has been separated into debt and an embedded derivative from 1 January 2005.
The embedded derivative option is fair valued through the income statement.
The impact of IAS 32 and 39 principally relates to additional accretion of the convertible bond to value at maturity, changes in fair value of the embedded derivative and other fair value adjustments on forward foreign exchange contracts.
