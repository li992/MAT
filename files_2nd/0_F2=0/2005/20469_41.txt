Staff share schemes Analysis of share scheme charges credit per income statement: 31 December 31 December 2005 2004 000 000 SIP charge 263 UFSS charge 175 ESOT credit 4,452 Non-executive Director option charges 308 Total share scheme charges credit 438 4,144 Notes The Approved Share Incentive Plan the SIP Eligible employees qualify for awards under the SIP based upon the performance of the Group in each half-year against budget.
The current maximum award for each half-year amounts to 600,000 shares or a maximum annual award of 3,000 per employee if smaller.
For the 2005 financial year, a maximum of 1,181,565 shares will be awarded under this scheme.
For maximum awards to be made, the Groups core profit must exceed budget by 11.5 per cent.
Employees must remain in employment until the vesting date three years from the date of award, otherwise the shares will be forfeited.
The fair value of shares awarded is either the share price at the date of award, or is estimated at the latest share price available when drawing up the financial statements for awards not yet made and later adjusted to reflect the actual share price on the award date.
Awards under the SIP are entitled to receive dividends, and hence no adjustment has been made to this fair value.
The Unapproved Free Share Scheme the UFSS This scheme is open to managers within the Group excluding current Executive Directors with variable awards available.
Under the scheme, individuals receive an award of free shares at no charge.
A total of 269 employees received awards under this scheme during June 2005.
Staff must remain in employment until the vesting date in June 2008 in order for the shares to vest.
The maximum number of shares that can be awarded relating to the 2005 scheme is 685,000.
74 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For an award to vest, the Total Shareholder Return TSR of Admiral Group plc shares over the three years 2005 to 2007 must be at least equal to the TSR of the FTSE 350 index, of which the Company is a constituent.
If the Companys TSR does not meet this target, no awards will vest under the 2005 UFSS scheme.
If this initial hurdle is overcome, individual awards are calculated based on the growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS relative to a risk free return RFR, for which LIBOR has been selected as a benchmark.
This performance is measured over the same three-year period.
The range of awards is as follows: if the growth in EPS is less than the RFR, no awards vest EPS growth is equal to RFR 10% of maximum award vests to achieve the maximum award, EPS growth has to be approximately 15% per annum compound over the next three year period, assuming RFR remains at about 4.5% Between 10% and 100% of the maximum awards, a linear relationship exists.
Awards under the UFSS are not eligible for dividends and hence the fair value of free shares to be awarded under this scheme has been revised downwards to take account of these distributions.
The unadjusted fair value is based on the share price at the date on which awards were made being 3.62.
As noted in the financial review, the criteria for UFSS awards have been amended for the 2006 scheme.
Further details are contained in the financial review.
