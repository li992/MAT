by adopting the actual fair market value at the balance sheet date rather than a market-related value.
Had this methodology been applied in previous years, it would have resulted in an increase in net income for the year ended 31 December 2001 of 86 million.
h During the year ended 31 December 2002, Unilever recognised for US GAAP reporting purposes FAS 142 which ceased amortisation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Amortisation expense on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on a US GAAP basis for the year ended 31 December 2001 was 1 748 million.
i Turnover from continuing operations for the year was 39 672 million 2004: 38 566 million.
j For the basis of the calculation of combined earnings per share see note 8 on page 97. k For information on net income per share for continuing operations, please refer to page 157. l Net profit margin is expressed as net profit attributable to shareholders equity as a percentage of turnover from total operations.
