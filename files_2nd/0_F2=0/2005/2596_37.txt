a Business combinations, goodwill and customer lists and relationships IFRS 3 Business Combinations requires that goodwill arising from business combinations should not be amortised and will be tested annually for impairment.
In addition certain intangible assets which were previously recognised as part of goodwill under UK GAAP are now required to be recognised separately and amortised over their estimated useful lives.
As permitted by IFRS 1 the Group has chosen to apply IFRS 3 from 1 January 2004 and has elected not to restate previous business combinations.
The acquisition accounting for acquisitions made during 2004 has been restated in accordance with IFRS 3 and IAS 38 Intangible Assets, which has resulted in the recognition of certain intangible assets relating to customer lists and relationships.
As such, 230.8m has been transferred from goodwill to intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2004.
These intangible assets are being amortised over their estimated useful lives.
As a result, amortisation relating to goodwill on the balance sheet at the date of transition net of the amortisation charged on intangible assets has been reversed, resulting in a credit to income of 16.6m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Under UK GAAP the Group was permitted to make adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired in business combinations for a period up to the end of the financial year following the date of acquisition the investigative period.
Under IFRS the investigative period covers one calendar year from the date of acquisition.
During the year ended 31 December 2004 adjustments were made to the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations since the date of transition, the timing of which were within the investigative period for UK GAAP but fell outside the investigative period under IFRS.
As a result, 2.2m of fair value adjustments which were recognised in goodwill under UK GAAP were charged to the consolidated income statement under IFRS for the year ended 31 December 2004. b Post employment benefits Due to the Group having previously adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benefits under UK GAAP, there are no significant differences arising upon transition to IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
A credit adjustment of 0.7m has been made to the pension liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2004 to take account of the different valuation methodologies for pension scheme assets under IAS 19.
The full actuarial deficit has been recognised rather than the corridor approach that can be adopted under IAS 19.
34 Bunzl plc Directors Report and Accounts 2005 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued b Post employment benefits continued The disclosure requirements of IAS 19 require pension assets or liabilities recognised on the balance sheet to be stated gross of deferred tax, rather than being stated net of deferred tax as required by FRS 17.
Accordingly 21.5m of deferred tax relating to pension liabilities has been reclassified as a deferred tax asset within the IFRS consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2004. c Deferred and current taxes The scope of IAS 12 Income Taxes is wider than the corresponding UK GAAP standards and requires deferred tax to be provided on all temporary differences rather than just certain taxable timing differences under UK GAAP.
As a result, a deferred tax liability of 1.3m relating to previously revalued fixed assets has been included in the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2004.
In addition a deferred tax asset of 1.9m resulting from the recognition of an expense for share based payments has been included in the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2004.
IAS 12 also requires a deferred tax liability to be recognised in the consolidated balance sheet upon recognition of intangible assets other than goodwill as part of a business combination.
This deferred tax liability is unwound through the consolidated income statement in line with the amortisation profile of the intangible assets acquired.
Accordingly 75.5m has been recognised on the consolidated balance sheet as deferred tax at 31 December 2004 with 2.8m of the deferred tax being credited to the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004. d Share based payments IFRS 2 Share Based Payments requires that an expense for all equity instruments granted is recognised based on the fair value at the date of grant.
This expense, which is in relation to option and performance share schemes, is recognised over the vesting period of the relevant scheme.
The Group has adopted a valuation model for the purposes of computing fair value under IFRS as at the date of grant.
The additional pre-tax expense arising from the adoption of IFRS 2 on the Groups consolidated income statement is 3.9m for the year ended 31 December 2004. e Post balance sheet events IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date requires that dividends declared after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a liability at that balance sheet date as the liability does not represent a present obligation as defined by IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
The final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2003 of 37.0m has been reversed in the IFRS opening balance sheet at 1 January 2004 and charged in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 39.9m has been reversed in the IFRS balance sheet at 31 December 2004 and has been charged in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity for the year ended 31 December 2005. f Previously revalued properties Upon transition to IFRS, the Group elected to treat the UK GAAP value of all previously revalued properties as deemed cost.
During the year ended 31 December 2004 one previously revalued property was deemed impaired, with the impairment loss of 1.3m being charged against the revaluation reserve under UK GAAP.
Under IFRS, as the revaluation reserve was transferred to retained earnings upon transition as permitted by IFRS 1, the impairment loss has been taken to the consolidated income statement.
g Financial instruments IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement address the accounting for, and reporting of, financial instruments.
IAS 39 sets out detailed accounting requirements in relation to financial assets and liabilities.
As outlined in Note 1, this was applied for the first time for the year ended 31 December 2005.
All derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value whilst other financial instruments are accounted for either at amortised cost or at fair value depending on their classification.
Subject to stringent criteria, derivative financial instruments, financial assets and financial liabilities may be designated as forming hedge relationships as a result of which fair value changes are offset in the income statement or charged credited to equity depending on the nature of the hedge relationship.
From 1 January 2005 hedge accounting has been adopted for the Groups forward currency contracts which are taken out to hedge the cost of foreign currency debtors and creditors, thereby reducing potential volatility in the income statement.
Hedge accounting has also been adopted for the Groups interest rate swaps and underlying capital market debt, thereby reducing potential volatility in the income statement.
h Other disclosure changes Under UK GAAP the deferred tax position of the Group is shown net on the consolidated balance sheet.
Under IFRS the assets and liabilities are required to be shown separately net of any allowable offsets and, as such, 8.6m has been reclassified as deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2004.
Under UK GAAP provisions are not disclosed according to their expected usage date.
IFRS requires that provisions should be classified into current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
As a result, 7.1m of provisions has been reclassified as current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2004.
