Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 194 Financial statements continued Financial statements of the Company Notes to the company financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 A First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards i The Company has adopted International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005.
In order to show comparative balances, the year ended 31 December 2004 is also shown under IFRS.
The date of transition to IFRS is, therefore, 1 January 2004.
In general, a company is required to determine its IFRS accounting policies and apply these retrospectively to determine its opening balance sheet under IFRS.
However, International Financial Reporting Standard 1, First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS 1 allows a number of exemptions to this general principle upon adoption of IFRS.
Where applicable, the Company has taken advantage of the same transitional arrangements as in the Group, as described in note 1 a. ii Reconciliation of equity reported under UK GAAP to equity reported under IFRS As at As at 1 January 31 December 2004 2004 m m Equity as reported under UK GAAP 10,752 12,937 Adjusted for: Dividend recognition see 1 below 6 1,344 Revaluation of investments in subsidiaries see 2 below 1,911 4,200 Pensions see 3 below 4 27 Equity compensation plans see 4 below 28 Direct Capital Instrument interest 6 Other items 2 4 12,663 15,804 Deferred tax impact of above adjustments 18 Equity as reported under IFRS 12,664 15,812 iii Reconciliation of profit and loss reported under UK GAAP to profit and loss reported under IFRS For the year ended 31 December 2004 m profit for the year as reported under UK GAAP 1,469 Adjusted for: Dividend recognition see 1 below 1,372 Pensions see 3 below 23 Equity compensation plans see 4 below 13 87 Deferred tax impact of above adjustments 7 profit for the year as reported under IFRS 94 iv Adjustments between UK GAAP and IFRS The basis for the material adjustments between UK GAAP and IFRS is as follows: 1 Dividend recognition Under UK GAAP, dividends are accrued in the period to which they relate, regardless of when they are declared and approved.
Under IAS 10, Events after the Balance Sheet Date, shareholders dividends are accrued only when declared and appropriately approved.
This affects both dividends receivable from subsidiaries and those payable to shareholders, increasing shareholders funds by 6 million at 1 January 2004 and reducing them by 1,344 million at 31 December 2004. profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 was similarly reduced by 1,372 million as a result.
2 Investments in subsidiaries Under UK GAAP, subsidiaries are stated at current value which, for this purpose, is embedded value for life operations and net asset value for other entities.
As a result of applying IAS 39, subsidiaries are stated at their fair values, estimated using applicable valuation models underpinned by the Companys market capitalisation.
This uplift in valuation has increased shareholders funds by 1,911 million at 1 January 2004 and by 4,200 million at 31 December 2004.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 195 A First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards continued 3 Pensions As explained in note 1 b iii of the Group accounts, the Groups UK GAAP pension policy was to expense the cost of providing pension benets using actuarial valuation methods which give a substantially even charge over the expected service lives of employees.
This resulted in either a prepayment or an accrual to the extent that this charge did not equate to the cash contributions made into the schemes.
Under IAS 19, Employee Benets, the projected benefit obligation is matched against the fair value of the underlying assets and other unrecognised actuarial gains and losses in determining the pension expense for the year in the Group financial statements.
As explained in note C ii below, the Company now recognises a pension expense equal to its contributions payable in the year and provides for the cost of any unfunded benets.
This has reduced shareholders funds by 4 million at 1 January 2004 and by 27 million at 31 December 2004. profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 was similarly reduced by 23 million as a result.
4 Equity compensation plans Under IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, the Company has established an equity compensation reserve for all options and awards granted over its shares.
The credit to equity as at 31 December 2004 arises because the cost of such options and awards is borne by the participating businesses and the charge to the Company's own income statement is therefore less than the reserve credit.
The credit to the 2004 income statement under IFRS reects the timing difference between charging under UK GAAP and IFRS for these options and awards.
B Investments in subsidiaries i Movements in the Companys investments in its subsidiaries are as follows: 2005 2004 m m Fair value as at 1 January 19,538 15,544 Acquisitions 2,973 1,500 Disposals 1,113 Movement in fair value 1,521 2,494 At 31 December 22,919 19,538 ii In the table above, Acquisitions includes the purchase of the entire share capital of RAC plc on 4 May 2005, full details of which are given in note 3 a i on page 106.
On 24 August 2005, this investment was transferred to a subsidiary for the same consideration and is included in the heading disposals above.
As part of the ongoing Group restructuring, the Company acquired all the shares in Norwich Union Holdings Limited and Norwich Union Limited from subsidiaries on 12 December and 20 December 2005 respectively.
These transactions were carried out at their fair values and are also included in acquisitions above.
At 31 December 2005, the Company has four wholly-owned subsidiaries, all incorporated in Great Britain.
These are CGNU Holdings Australia Limited, General Accident plc, Norwich Union Limited and Norwich Union Holdings Limited.
CGNU Holdings Australia Limited and Norwich Union Holdings Limited are intermediate holding companies, whilst General Accident plc and Norwich Union Limited no longer carry out this function.
The principal subsidiaries of the Aviva Group at 31 December 2005 are listed on page 222.
C Operating expenses i Operating expenses comprise: 2005 2004 m m Staff costs and other employee-related expenditure 62 55 Other operating costs 120 84 Net foreign exchange gains losses 22 29 160 168 ii Pension costs The Company is one of a number of UK companies being charged for its employees participating in the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme, and its contributions are affected by the financial position of the scheme.
There is no contractual agreement or policy for charging the net dened benefit cost for this scheme across the participating Group entities but, instead, this cost is recognised in the financial statements of the main UK employing company.
The Company therefore recognises a pension expense equal to its contributions payable in the year, together with changes in provisions for the cost of any unfunded benets, within staff costs above.
Full disclosure on the Groups pension schemes is given in note 42 on pages 164 to 167.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 196 Financial statements continued Financial statements of the Company Notes to the company financial statements continued C Operating expenses continued iii Equity compensation plans All transactions in the Groups equity compensation plans involve options and awards for ordinary shares of the Company.
Full disclosure of these plans is given in note 28 on pages 142 to 145.
The cost of such options and awards is borne by all participating businesses and, where relevant, the Company bears an appropriate change.
iv Auditors remuneration Other corporate costs include auditors remuneration in respect of the Company of 77,000 2004: 13,000.
The higher fees in 2005 reect additional work carried out in connection with the Companys transition to IFRS for its own financial statements.
Audit fees in respect of further assurance services totalled 237,000 2004: 747,000.

The Company has unrecognised tax losses of 167 million 2004: nil to carry forward against future taxable profits.

Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 204 Financial statements continued Alternative method of reporting long-term business continued Basis of preparation EEV basis The consolidated income statement and balance sheet on pages 200 and 202 present the Groups results and financial position for the life and related businesses on the European Embedded Value EEV basis and for its non-life businesses on the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS basis.
The EEV methodology adopted is in accordance with the EEV Principles introduced by the CFO Forum in May 2004.
In October 2005 the CFO Forum published additional guidance on EEV disclosures applicable for financial reporting for the year ending 31 December 2006 which has been reected as far as is possible in this report, in accordance with our previous reporting.
In the directors opinion, the EEV basis provides a more accurate reection of the performance of the Groups life and related operations year on year than results presented under the IFRS basis.
The directors consider that the EEV methodology represents a more meaningful basis of reporting the underlying value of the Groups life and related businesses and the underlying drivers of performance.
This basis allows for the impact of uncertainty in the future investment returns more explicitly and is consistent with the way the business is priced and managed.
The Groups approach to establishing economic assumptions specically investment returns, required capital and discount rates was reviewed by Tillinghast, a rm of actuarial consultants, at the time of adopting the EEV principles in 2004.
The approach is based on the well established capital asset pricing model theory and is in line with the EEV Principles and Guidance.
The results for 2005 and 2004 have been audited by our auditors, Ernst & Young LLP.
Their report in respect of 2005 is included in the Report and Accounts on page 199 of this document.
Covered business The EEV calculations cover the following lines of business: life insurance, long-term health and accident insurance, savings, pensions and annuity business written by our life insurance subsidiaries, including managed pension fund business and our share of the other life and related business written in our associated undertakings and joint ventures, as well as the equity release business written in the UK.
The adoption of IFRS has resulted in no change to the Groups denition of new business under EEV and so includes contracts that meet the denition of non-participating investment contracts under IFRS.
Covered business includes the Groups share of our joint venture operations including our arrangement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group RBSG and our operations in India and China.
In addition, the results of Group companies providing significant administration, investment management and other services and of Group holding companies have been included to the extent that they relate to covered business.
Together these businesses are referred to as Life and related businesses.
New business premiums New business premiums include: premiums arising from the sales of new contracts during the year: non-contractual additional premiums, including future Department of Work and Pensions DWP rebate premiums: and expected renewals on new contracts and expected future contractual alterations to new contracts.
For products sold to individuals, premiums are generally considered to represent new business in certain circumstances, including where a new contract has been signed, or where underwriting has been performed.
Renewal premiums include contractual renewals, non-contractual variations that are reasonably predictable and recurrent single premiums that are pre-dened and reasonably predictable.
For group products, new business includes new contracts and increases to aggregate premiums under existing contracts.
Renewal premiums are based on the level of premium received during the reporting period and allow for premiums expected to be received beyond the expiry of any guaranteed premium rates.
Foreign exchange adjustments Embedded value and other balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies have been translated to sterling using the appropriate closing exchange rate.
New business contribution and other income statement items have been translated using an average exchange rate for the relevant period.
The exchange rates adopted in this announcement are shown on page 106.
EEV methodology Overview Under the EEV methodology, profit is recognised as it is earned over the life of products dened within covered business.
The total profit recognised over the lifetime of a policy is the same as under the IFRS basis of reporting, but the timing of recognition is different.
Calculation of the embedded value The shareholders interest in the life and related businesses is represented by the embedded value.
The embedded value is the total of the net worth of the life and related businesses and the value of in-force covered business.
Calculations are performed separately for each business and are based on the cash ows of that business, after allowing for both external and intra-group reinsurance.
Where one life business has an interest in another life business, the net worth of that business excludes the interest in the dependent company.
The embedded value is calculated on an after-tax basis applying current legislation and practice together with future known changes.
profits are then grossed up for tax at the full rate of corporation tax for the UK and at an appropriate rate for each of the other countries based on opening year tax rates.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 205 EEV methodology continued Net worth The net worth is the market value of the shareholders funds and the shareholders interest in the surplus held in the non-profit component of the long-term business funds, determined on a statutory solvency basis and adjusted to add back any non-admissible assets, and consists of the required capital and free surplus.
Required capital is reported net of implicit items permitted on a local regulatory basis to cover minimum solvency margins which are assessed at a local entity basis.
The level of required capital for each business, which ranges between 100% and 150% of the EU minimum solvency requirement for our main European businesses, reects the level of capital considered by the directors to be appropriate to manage the business, allowing for our internal assessment of the level of market, insurance and operating risk inherent in the underlying products.
The same denition of required capital is used for both existing and new business.
The free surplus comprises the market value of shareholder assets in excess of local statutory reserves and required capital.
Value of in-force covered business The value of in-force covered business is the present value at the appropriate risk discount rate which incorporates a risk margin of the distributable profits to shareholders arising from the in-force covered business projected on a best estimate basis, less a deduction for the cost of holding the required level of capital.
In the UK, shareholders distributable profits arise when they are released following actuarial valuations.
These valuations are carried out in accordance with statutory requirements designed to ensure and demonstrate solvency in long-term business funds.
Future distributable profits will depend on experience in a number of areas such as investment return, discontinuance rates, mortality, administration costs, as well as management and policyholder actions.
Releases to shareholders arising in future years from the in-force covered business and associated required capital can be projected using best estimate assumptions of future experience.
In overseas businesses generally, there are similar requirements restricting payments to shareholders from life businesses.
The value of in-force covered business includes an allowance for the impact of financial options and guarantees arising from best estimate assumptions the intrinsic value and from additional costs related to the variability of investment returns the time value.
The intrinsic value is included in the underlying value of the in-force covered business using deterministic assumptions.
The time value of financial options and guarantees has been determined using stochastic modelling techniques.
Stochastic modelling typically involves projecting the future cash ows of the business under thousands of economic scenarios that are representative of the possible future outcomes for market variables such as interest rates and equity returns.
Allowance is made, where appropriate, for the effect of management and or policyholder actions in different economic conditions on future assumptions such as asset mix, bonus rates and surrender rates.
The time value is determined by deducting the average value of shareholder cash ows under these economic scenarios from the deterministic shareholder value under best estimate assumptions.
The cost of holding required capital is the difference between the required capital and the present value at the appropriate risk discount rate of the projected release of the required capital and investment earnings on the assets deemed to back the required capital.
Where the required capital is covered by policyholder assets, for example in the UK with-profit funds, there is no impact of cost of capital on shareholder value.
The assets regarded as covering the required capital are those that the operation deems appropriate.
The value of in-force covered business includes the capitalised value of profits and losses arising from subsidiary companies providing administration, investment management and other services to the extent that they relate to covered business.
This is referred to as the look through into service company expenses.
In addition, expenses arising in holding companies that relate directly to acquiring or maintaining covered business have been allowed for.
Where external companies provide services to the life and related businesses, their charges have been allowed for in the underlying projected cost base.
Risk discount rates Under the EEV methodology, a risk discount rate RDR is required to express a stream of expected future distributable profits as a single value at a particular date the present value.
It is the interest rate that an investment equal to the present value would have to earn in order to be able to replicate exactly the stream of future profits.
The RDR is a combination of a risk free rate to reect the time value of money plus a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years may differ from that assumed.
In particular, a risk margin is added to allow for the risk that expected additional returns on certain asset classes eg.
Risk discount rates for our life businesses have been calculated using a risk margin based upon a Group Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
The Group WACC is calculated using a gross risk free interest rate, an equity risk margin, a market assessed risk factor beta, and an allowance for the gearing impact of debt nancing including subordinated debt on a market value basis.
The market assessed risk factor captures the markets view of the effect of all types of risk on our business, including operational and other non-economic risk.
The RDR is only one component of the overall allowance for risk in EEV calculations.
Risk is also allowed for in the cost of holding statutory reserving margins, additional required capital and in the time value of options and guarantees.
Hence to derive the RDR the Group WACC is adjusted to reect the average level of required capital assumed to be held, and to reect the explicit valuation of the time value of options and guarantees.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 206 Financial statements continued Alternative method of reporting long-term business continued EEV methodology continued In order to derive risk discount rates for each of our life businesses, the adjusted Group WACC is expressed as a risk margin in excess of the gross risk free interest rate used in the WACC calculation as described above.
Business-specic discount rates are then calculated as the sum of this risk margin and the appropriate local gross risk free rate at the valuation date, based on returns on government bonds.
A common risk free rate, and hence a common RDR, is used for all of our businesses within the Eurozone.
Additional country-specic risk margins are applied to smaller businesses to reect additional economic, political and business-specic risk for example, risk margins ranging from 3.7% to 8.7% are applied to the Groups eastern European and Asian operations.
Within each business, a constant RDR has been applied in all future time periods and in each of the economic scenarios underlying the calculation of the time value of options and guarantees.
At each valuation date, the risk margin is reassessed based on current economic factors and is updated only if a significant change has occurred.
In particular, changes in risk prole arising from movements in asset mix are allowed for via the updated risk margin calculation.
Participating business Future regular bonuses on participating business are projected in a manner consistent with current bonus rates and expected future returns on assets deemed to back the policies.
For with-profit funds in the UK and Ireland, for the purpose of recognising the value of the estate, it is assumed that terminal bonuses are increased to exhaust all of the assets in the fund over the future lifetime of the in-force with-profit policies.
However, under stochastic modelling there may be some extreme economic scenarios when the total assets in the Groups with-profit funds are not sufficient to pay all policyholder claims.
The average additional shareholder cost arising from this shortfall has been included in the time value of options and guarantees.
For profit sharing business in continental Europe, where policy benets and shareholder value depend on the timing of realising gains, apportionment of unrealised gains between policyholders benets and shareholders reect contractual requirements as well as existing practice.
Where under certain economic scenarios additional shareholder injections are required to meet policyholder payments, the average additional cost has been included in the time value of options and guarantees.
Consolidation adjustments The effect of transactions between our life companies such as loans and reinsurance arrangements has been included in results split by territory in a consistent manner.
No elimination is required on consolidation.
As the EEV methodology incorporates the impact of profits and losses arising from subsidiary companies providing administration, investment management and other services to the Groups life companies, the equivalent profits and losses have been removed from the relevant segment non insurance or fund management and are instead included within the results of life and related businesses.
In addition, the underlying basis of calculation for these profits has changed from the IFRS basis to the EEV basis.
The capitalised value of the future profits and losses from such service companies are included in the embedded value and new business contribution calculations for the relevant territory, but the net assets representing historical profits and other amounts remain under non-insurance or fund management.
In order to reconcile the profits arising in the financial period within each segment with the assets on the opening and closing balance sheets, a transfer of IFRS profits from life and related business to the appropriate segment is deemed to occur.
An equivalent approach has been adopted for expenses within our holding companies.
Components of life EEV return The life EEV return comprises the following components: new business contribution written during the period including value added between the point of sale and end of the period: the profit from existing business equal to: the expected return on the value of the in-force covered business at the beginning of the period, experience variances caused by the differences between the actual experience during the period and expected experience based on the operating assumptions used to calculate the start of year value, the impact of changes in operating assumptions including risk-margins: the expected investment return on the shareholders' net worth, based upon assumptions applying at the start of the year: investment return variances caused by differences between the actual return in the period and the expected return based on economic assumptions used to calculate the start of year value: and the impact of changes in economic assumptions in the period.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 207 Components of life EEV return continued The life EEV operating return comprises the first three of these components and is calculated using economic assumptions as at the start of the year and operating demographic, expenses and tax assumptions as at the end of the year.

New business contribution The following tables set out the premium volumes and contribution from new business written by the life and related businesses, consistent with the denition of new business set out on page 204.
The contribution generated by new business written during the period is the present value of the projected stream of after tax distributable profit from that business.
New business contribution before tax is calculated by grossing up the contribution after tax at the full corporation tax rate for UK business and at appropriate rates of tax for other countries.
New business contribution has been calculated using the same economic assumptions as those used to determine the embedded value as at the start of the year and operating assumptions used to determine the embedded value as at the end of the year, and is rolled forward to the end of the financial period.
New business contribution is shown before and after the effect of required capital, calculated on the same basis as for in-force covered business.
New business sales are expressed on two bases: annual premium equivalent APE and the present value of future new business premiums PVNBP.
The PVNBP calculation is equal to total single premium sales received in the year plus the discounted value of regular premiums expected to be received over the term of the new contracts, and is expressed at the point of sale.
The premium volumes and projection assumptions used to calculate the present value of regular premiums for each product are the same as those used to calculate new business contribution, so the components of the new business margin are on a consistent basis.
United Kingdom APE has been restated to include NUER APE volumes of 37 million 2004: 48 million.
New business margin represents the ratio of new business contribution before the effect of required capital to PVNBP, expressed as a percentage.

The movement comprises an increase of 557 million in relation to new business written, a reduction of 415 million in relation to in-force business and a reduction of 56 million in relation to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The reduction in the in-force required capital includes a release of 245 million arising from the restructure of the UK nonprofit funds and a release of 295 million arising from the reduction in the level of required capital for UK annuities.
The underlying increase in the in-force required capital of 125 million which reects the effect of the reduction in long-term interest rates, which has increased statutory reserves, and therefore capital requirements and has more than off-set the reduction in capital in respect of business run-off.

Mortality experience continues to be better than assumed across most of our businesses, and particularly for protection business in the UK, AFER and unit-linked business in France and group business in the Netherlands.
Lapse experience in the UK has been worse than assumed and mainly relates to bonds and pension business.
In Ireland, the adverse persistency has mainly arisen on unitlinked pensions business.
In the UK, other experience profits includes better than assumed default experience on corporate bonds and commercial mortgages.
Mortality assumptions have been revised in the Netherlands following the publication of new annuitant mortality tables used for group business.
In the UK, the adverse lapse assumption change reects a more prudent allowance for future persistency experience in the UK following recent experience.
In Ireland, the lapse assumption change mainly relates to unit-linked pension business.
Lapse assumption changes in the Netherlands largely relate to group business in the intermediary division.
Other operating assumption changes in the UK primarily relate to the change in annuitant required capital to 150% of required minimum margins which results in a 110 million one-off benefit.
In France other operating assumptions represent an allowance for further tax benets arising from dividends from subsidiaries.
In the Netherlands, they reect a variety of changes including increased annual management fees on unit-linked contracts, favourable change in asset mix, and the reduction of future guaranteed returns on group pensions business in Belgium.
In Poland it was previously assumed that the introduction of new individual pension products would lead to significant conversion of existing policies.
The prudent allowance made for this is no longer required.

Maintenance expenses in the UK reect the benefit of cost saving initiatives undertaken.
Exceptional expenses in the UK reect costs of 65 million for the restructuring of the business services division and one-off project costs of 88 million associated with the pace of regulatory change.
Mortality experience across our major businesses continues to be better than our assumptions for protection and annuity business in the UK and protection business in continental Europe.
Lapse experience in the UK has been adverse and mainly relates to bonds, protection schemes and pension products.
In the UK, other experience profits include 29 million of profits arising from better than assumed default experience on corporate bonds and commercial mortgages.
Maintenance expense assumption changes in the UK reect the benefit of cost saving initiatives coming through.
The UK and the Netherlands include capitalised additional future project expenses.
Adverse lapse assumption changes in the UK relates to unitised with-profit bonds and unit-linked bonds.
In Ireland, lapse assumption changes have been made on unit-linked pensions business following recent experience.
Other operating assumptions in the Netherlands relates to positive changes in asset mix and tax reecting, in part, the fact that the embedded value of Delta Lloyd was previously assessed using a blended average tax rate of 25%, which is below the local corporation tax rate.
The calculation has been rened to tax all future profits at the full corporation tax rate at the beginning of the year of 34.5% and to allow explicitly for the tax benefit arising from investing in the 5% holdings investments in Dutch companies where at least 5% of the share capital is owned, on which all investment income is tax free.
This change results in a 53 million one-off benefit.
France includes the benefit of tax assumption changes.
France has historically recorded favourable tax operating experience as a result of better than assumed tax on dividend income.
Previously the tax assumptions had been set at full corporation tax for all future profits, whereas in fact dividend income from subsidiaries is tax exempt.
In 2004, the calculation has been rened such that the future tax benefit arising from dividend from subsidiaries has now been recognised.
This change results in a 39 million benefit.

In the Netherlands, this relates mainly to maturity guarantees on unit-linked products and interest rate guarantees on traditional individual and Group profit sharing business.
The TVOG has increased over the year to 303 million primarily due to the allowance included in new business contribution of 31 million.
Also included is an increase of 15 million due to the 40 basis points fall in bond yields in continental Europe during 2005, which have largely been offset by the favourable impacts of investment returns and exchange rates.

The same margins are applied on a consistent basis across the Group to gross risk free yields to obtain investment return assumptions for ordinary shares and property and to produce risk discount rates.
Additional country-specic risk margins are applied to smaller businesses to reect additional economic, political and business specic risks, which result in the application of risk margins ranging from 3.7% to 8.7% in our eastern European and Asian business operations.
Expense ination is derived as a xed margin above a local measure of long-term price ination.
Risk free rates and price ination have been harmonised across territories within the euro currency zone, except for expense ination in Ireland where significant differences remain.
Required capital is shown as a multiple of the EU statutory minimum solvency margin.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 215 Principal economic assumptions deterministic calculations continued Investment return assumptions are generally derived by major product class, based on hypothecating the assets at the valuation date.
Future assumed reinvestment rates are consistent with implied market returns at 31 December 2006.
Rates have been derived using rates from the current yield curve at a duration based on the term of the liabilities, or directly from forward yield curves where considered appropriate.
Assumptions about future investment mix are consistent with long-term plans.
In most cases, the investment mix is assumed to continue unchanged throughout the projection period.
The changes in assumptions between reporting dates reect the actual movements in risk free yields in the UK, the Eurozone and other territories.
Future returns on corporate xed interest investments are calculated from prospective yields less an adjustment for credit risk.
Required capital in the United Kingdom is 150% EU minimum for Norwich Union Annuity Limited and 100% for other companies.
Required capital in Spain is 125% EU minimum for Aviva Vida y Pensiones and 110% for bancassurance companies.
Other economic assumptions Required capital relating to with-profit business is assumed to be covered by the surplus within the with-profit funds and no effect has been attributed to shareholders.
Bonus rates on participating business have been set at levels consistent with the economic assumptions and Avivas medium-term bonus plans.
The distribution of profit between policyholders and shareholders within the with-profit funds assumes that the shareholder interest in conventional with-profit business in the UK and Ireland continues at the current rate of one ninth of the cost of bonus.
Principal economic assumptions stochastic calculations The time value of options and guarantees calculation allows for expected management and policyholder actions in response to varying future investment conditions.
The management actions modelled include changes to asset mix and bonus rates.
Modelled policyholder actions are described under Other assumptions.
This section describes the models used to generate future investment simulations, and gives some sample statistics for the simulations used.
Two separate models have been used, for the UK businesses and for the Europe excluding UK and International businesses, as each of these models better reect the characteristics of the businesses.
United Kingdom Model Overall asset returns have been generated assuming that the portfolio total return has a lognormal distribution.
The mean and standard deviation of the overall asset return have been calculated using the evolving asset mix of the fund and assumptions over the mean and standard deviation of each asset class, together with correlations between them.
Asset Classes The significant asset classes for UK participating business are equities, property and long-term xed rate bonds.
The most significant assumption is the distribution of future long-term interest rates, since this is the most important factor in the cost of guaranteed annuity options.
Summary Statistics The following table sets out the means and standard deviations StDev of future returns at 31 December 2005 for the three most significant asset classes.
Interest rates are assumed to have a lognormal distribution with an annualised standard deviation of 13% p. a. for the natural logarithm of the interest rate.
Means have been calculated by accumulating a unit investment for the required number of years in each simulation, averaging the accumulation across all simulations, and converting the result to an equivalent annual rate by taking the nth root of the average accumulation minus 1.
Standard deviations have been calculated by accumulating a unit investment for the required number of years in each simulation, taking the natural logarithm of the result, calculating the variance of this statistic, dividing by the projection period n years and taking the square root.
This makes the result comparable to implied volatilities quoted in investment markets.
Depending on the duration of the portfolio For the UK, the statistics are the same over all projection horizons.
Assumptions are also required for correlations between asset classes.
These have been set based on an assessment of historical data.
Returns for corporate xed interest investments in each scenario are equal to the return on Government bonds plus a xed additional amount, based on current spreads less a margin for credit risk.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 217 Principal economic assumptions deterministic calculations continued Europe excluding UK and International Model Government nominal interest rates are generated by a model that projects a full yield curve at annual intervals.
The model assumes that the logarithm of the short rate follows a mean reverting process subject to two normally distributed random shocks.
This ensures that nominal interest rates are always positive, the distribution of future interest rates remains credible, and the model can be calibrated to give a good t to the initial yield curve.
The total annual return on equities is calculated as the return on one-year bonds plus an excess return.
The excess return is assumed to have a lognormal distribution.
The model also generates property total returns and real yield curves, although these are not significant asset classes for Aviva outside the UK.
Asset Classes The most important assets are xed rate bonds of various durations.
In some businesses equities are also an important asset class.
Summary Statistics The following table sets out the means and standard deviations of future euro returns at 31 December 2005 for the three most significant asset classes: equities, short-term bonds dened to be of one-year duration and long-term bonds dened to be 10-year zero coupon bonds.
In the accumulation of 10-year bonds, it is assumed that these are held for one-year, sold as 9-year bonds then the proceeds are reinvested in 10-year bonds, although in practice businesses follow more complex asset strategies or tend to adopt a buy and hold strategy.
Correlations between asset classes have been set using the same approach as described for the UK.
Other assumptions Taxation Current tax legislation and rates have been assumed to continue unaltered, except where changes in future tax rates have been announced.
Demographic assumptions Assumed future mortality, morbidity and lapse rates have been derived from an analysis of Avivas recent operating experience.
Where appropriate, surrender and option take up rate assumptions that vary according to the investment scenario under consideration have been used in the calculation of the time value of options and guarantees, based on our assessment of likely policyholder behaviour in different investment scenarios.
Expense assumptions Management expenses and operating expenses of holding companies attributed to life and related businesses have been included in the EEV calculations and split between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business, the maintenance of business in-force and project expenses.
Future expense assumptions include an allowance for maintenance expenses and a proportion of recurring project expenses.
Certain expenses of an exceptional nature, when they occur, are identied separately and are generally charged as incurred.
No future productivity gains have been anticipated.
Where subsidiary companies provide administration, investment management or other services to businesses included in the European Embedded Value calculations, the value of profits or losses arising from these services have been included in the embedded value and new business contribution.
Other It has been assumed that there will be no changes to the methods and bases used to calculate the statutory technical provisions and current surrender values, except where driven by varying future investment conditions under stochastic economic scenarios.

In addition, other factors can have a material impact, such as the nature of the options and guarantees, as well as the types of investments held.
The interest rate sensitivity will vary signicantly by territory, depending on the type of business written: for example, where non-profit business is well matched by backing assets, the favourable impact of reducing the risk discount rate is the dominant factor.
Sensitivities will also vary according to the current economic assumptions, mainly due to the impact of changes to both the intrinsic cost and time value of options and guarantees.
Options and guarantees are the main reason for the asymmetry of the sensitivities where the guarantee impacts to different extents under the different scenarios.
This can be seen in the sensitivity of a 1% movement in the interest rate for the Netherlands, where there is a significant amount of business with investment return guarantees.
The reduction of 40 basis points to the assumed pre-tax investment returns at 31 December 2005 has signicantly increased this sensitivity, reecting the level of the guarantees relative to the interest rate assumption.
Sensitivities to a 1% movement in the equity property return will only impact the value of the in-force covered business, whereas a 10% movement in equity property values may impact both the net worth and the value of in-force, depending on the allocation of assets.

Following a review of the Individual Capital Assessment results in the third quarter of 2005, Aviva concluded that the appropriate level of capital required to support the risks for this business is equivalent to 150% 2004: 200% of the EU required minimum margins RMM, notwithstanding the prudent margins incorporated in the technical provisions.
This brings the required capital used to report business performance closer in line with the economic capital required to support the business.
Changing the assumption of the required capital backing annuities to 100%, increases the reported value of new business contribution reported after the effect of required capital for 2005 by 13 million and increases the embedded value by 90 million, as shown on page 219.
Sensitivity analysis non-economic assumptions The tables below show the sensitivity of the embedded value as at 31 December 2005 and the new business contribution before the effect of required capital for 2005 to the following changes in non-economic assumptions: 10% decrease in maintenance expenses a 10% sensitivity on a base expense assumption of 10 pa would represent an expense assumption of 9 pa. Where there is a look through into service company expenses, the fee charged by the service company is unchanged while the underlying expense decreases: 10% decrease in lapse rates a 10% sensitivity on a base assumption of 5% pa would represent a lapse rate of 4.5% pa : 10% decrease in both mortality and morbidity rates.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 221 Sensitivity analysis non-economic assumptions continued No future management actions are modelled in reaction to the changing non-economic assumptions.
In each sensitivity calculation, all other assumptions remain unchanged.

Different products will be more or less sensitive to the change, and impacts may partially offset.
