Notes to the Company Financial Statements 31 December 2005 1 Accounting policies The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain fixed assets, and comply with applicable UK accounting standards.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the forward contract rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
Profits and losses of overseas subsidiaries and associated companies are translated into Sterling at the weighted average rates of exchange for the year.
Exchange differences on the opening net assets and results for the year, together with the exchange movements on related foreign currency loans, are dealt with through reserves.
Other exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Except for freehold land which is not depreciated, the cost or valuation of tangible fixed assets is depreciated using a straight line basis over their expected useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold land and buildings the lesser of 50 years and the period of the lease Plant and equipment between 3 and 10 years Revaluation of properties The group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of FRS 15 Tangible fixed assets and retained the book amounts of certain freehold properties which were revalued prior to implementation of that standard.
Where depreciation charges are increased following a revaluation, an amount equal to the increase is transferred annually from the revaluation reserve to the profit and loss account as a movement on reserves.
On the disposal or recognition of a provision for impairment of a revalued fixed asset, any related balance remaining in the revaluation reserve is also transferred to the profit and loss account as a movement on reserves.
Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
Dividends Dividends are accrued where declared and unpaid at the balance sheet date.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Company Financial Statements 72 1 Accounting policies continued Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the groups balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the profit and loss account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments The company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements.
The company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives, as set out in note 10.
Net borrowings Net borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents together with short and long term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect of related derivative instruments irrespective of whether they qualify for hedge accounting.
Pension funding The costs of contributions to the groups pension schemes and of augmenting existing pensions are charged to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the expected period of benefits from employees service.
The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the group, in separate trusteeadministered funds.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

The special item represents the revaluation of US Dollar loan notes from the rate of the related cross currency swaps to the year end rate, together with the transitional adjustment required to reflect movements in fair value caused by variations in interest rates, and subsequent amortisation thereof, to the extent that these constituted effective hedges under pre FRS 26 UK GAAP.
10 Financial instruments The companys treasury function operates procedures designed to reduce or eliminate financial risk and ensure that funds are available for current and future needs.
The policies are approved by the Board and the use of financial instruments is strictly controlled.
Yule Catto & Co plcs policy is to finance itself using a mixture of equity and debt instruments.
The companys principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The company also uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the companys operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the companys policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the companys financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk The company finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, loan notes and bank borrowings.
The company borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile in order to manage the companys exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Company Financial Statements 76 10 Financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk The company uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are predominantly denominated in Euros.
Profit translation exposures are not hedged.
The company hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The companys policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
Consequently, there are no material currency exposures to disclose 2004 none.
Liquidity risk The objective of the company is to meet financial commitments as and when they fall due.
The Board closely monitors liquidity through monthly management accounts.
At the year end, Yule Catto & Co plc had the following principal facilities: A committed syndicated bank revolving credit facility of 60 million which expires in November 2009.
This credit facility was negotiated in November 2004.
Unsecured loan notes totalling approximately 175 million raised from the US private placement market in 1999 and 2004.
With maturity between 2008 and 2016, these loan notes provide the groups long term requirements.

Impact on profit and loss account Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts amounting to 2,420,691 have been charged to the income statement in the year 2004 260,095.
Hedge accounting The company has a number of cross currency and interest rate swaps that are used to reduce the exposure to interest rate and currency risk.
These swaps are fully effective at eliminating the risks they address and as such were accounted for as hedges under previous UK GAAP.
The company has reviewed the requirements necessary to permit the application of hedge accounting under FRS 26.
It has concluded that the costs involved in meeting these requirements cannot be justified and therefore FRS 26 hedge accounting will not be applied.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments to which hedge accounting is not applied are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
FRS 26 exemption FRS 26 includes an exemption not to restate comparatives.
If this exemption were to be taken, the comparative information in the 2005 financial statements would be presented on the existing UK GAAP basis and would not be restated in line with FRS 26.
To present a consistent treatment in each period, Yule Catto has decided not to take this exemption.
Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the Company Financial Statements 77 Notes to the Company Financial Statements 31 December 2005 continued 10 Financial instruments continued Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the groups financial liabilities.
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flow at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The carrying amount of short term borrowings approximates to book value.
Interest rate risk profile Financial liabilities After taking into account the various interest rate and currency swaps entered into by the company the currency and interest rate exposure of the company as at 31 December 2005 was: Floating rate Fixed rate Total Floating rate Fixed rate Total borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings 2005 2005 2005 2004 2004 2004 000 000 000 000 000 000 Sterling 19,301 155,000 174,301 69,456 170,000 239,456 US Dollar 2,687 2,687 2,465 2,465 Euro 1,485 16,518 15,033 8,450 25,486 17,036 20,503 171,518 192,021 63,471 195,486 258,957 Cash and cash equivalents 1,318 165 Net borrowings underlying performance 190,703 258,792 The effective interest rate for the year was 6.5% 2004 6.2%.

16 Guarantees and other financial commitments The company has given guarantees amounting to 13,218,000 2004 13,815,000 in respect of bank and other facilities of subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The company has, in the normal course of business, entered into guarantees and counter-indemnities in respect of performance bonds, relating to the contracts of subsidiaries.
17 Pension commitments The group participates in a funded Scheme with both a defined benefit and defined contribution section the Yule Catto Group Retirement Benefit Scheme.
The Schemes defined benefit section was closed to new members with effect from 31 December 1998 and with effect from 1 January 1999 a defined contribution section was introduced and is open to all eligible group employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the companies concerned.
The pension charge for the year for the company amounted to 641,000 2004 539,000.
In accordance with FRS 17, the company will account for its contributions to the Defined Benefit scheme as if it were a Defined Contribution scheme because it is not possible to identify the companys share of the assets and liabilities in the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The latest actuarial valuation of the Scheme prepared for the purposes of making transitional disclosure in accordance with FRS 17 show a net pension liability of 57,600,000 at 31 December 2005.
FRS 17 disclosure Due to the application of IAS 19 to the group financial statements, resulting in changes to the required disclosures at group level, the disclosure requirements of FRS 17 for the group have been included below.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 6 April 2003 and updated to 31 December 2004 by a qualified actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2005 2004 2003 Rate of increase in salaries 3.50% 3.60% 3.50% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.50% 2.50% 2.50% Discount rate 4.90% 5.40% 5.50% Inflation assumption 2.50% 2.60% 2.50% The fair value of the assets in the scheme, the present value of the liabilities in the scheme and the expected rate of return at each balance sheet date were: 2005 2005 2004 2004 2003 2003 % 000 % 000 % 000 Equities 7.50 135,200 7.75 110,300 7.75 98,000 Bonds 4.63 31,800 5.13 27,600 5.25 22,600 Cash 4.00 700 4.00 900 4.00 800 Total fair value of assets 167,700 138,800 121,400 Present value of scheme liabilities 225,000 203,800 191,100 Deficit in the scheme 57,300 65,000 69,700 Related deferred tax asset 3,600 Net pension liability 57,300 65,000 66,100 The contribution rate for 2005 was 37.6% of pensionable earnings and the agreed contribution for next year is 37.9% of pensionable earnings.
The deferred tax asset has been revised for 2003 and 2004 followings further analysis of the recoverability of the tax asset within the group.
As a consequence the related deferred tax asset has been written down in both 2004 and 2003, reflecting the conclusion that this asset is not recoverable.
The impact is a reduction in deferred tax asset of 18.7 million in 2004 and 17.3 million in 2003.
In addition, the actuary has revised the calculation of the deficit at 31 December 2004 from 62.2 million to 65.0 million.
