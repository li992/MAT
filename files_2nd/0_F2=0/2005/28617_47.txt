Financial risk management The Group enters into contracts involving financial instruments during the normal course of its business in order to maximise interest earned on the Groups available liquidity.
Such financial instruments, which are primarily term deposits and certificates of deposit, are not held for trading purposes.
In addition, certain financial instruments such as market debtors and creditors arise directly from the Groups operations.
The Groups overall strategy and policies for monitoring and management of financial risk are set by the board of directors.
The Treasury Department, reporting through the Banking Committee to the Board, has principal responsibility for investing surplus liquidity and for monitoring exposure to market risk which includes interest rate risk and currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
All procedures and delegated authorities are documented in a Group Treasury Manual, and policy documents are in place to cover the management and monitoring of each type of risk.
Operational, reputational and legal risks are actively monitored by the Risk Management Committee which works with divisional management to identify and grade the different risks to which the business and support areas are exposed.
Active steps are taken to mitigate or control risks wherever practicable.

Financial risk management continued Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Interest rate risk is addressed by managing the mismatch between the Groups interest bearing and non-interest bearing assets and liabilities.
The Groups interest rate exposure is broadly reflected in the interest rate repricing table below.
The table shows the consolidated repricing profile of the Groups assets and liabilities, stated at their carrying amounts, as at the year end and therefore provides an indication of the sensitivity of the Groups earnings to interest rate movements.
Also shown are the weighted average effective interest rates for interest bearing monetary financial instruments at the year end.

The potential total profit or loss is calculated on the basis of the average number of days to repricing of the interest bearing liabilities compared with the period to repricing on a corresponding amount of interest bearing assets.
At 31 December 2005, Rathbone Investment Management Limited had 464.9 million 2004: 391.8 million of sterling liabilities averaging 8 days 2004: 2 days to repricing which were matched by sterling assets averaging 65 days 2004: 85 days to repricing, creating an exposure of 57 days 2004: 83 days.
This represented a total potential profit or loss of 726,000 2004: 892,000 at 31 December 2005 for a 1% decrease or increase in interest rates.
The impact of the groups forward rate agreements is to reduce this exposure by 25,000 2004: 50,000.
Currency risk The Group monitors its currency exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business on a daily basis and significant exposures are managed through the use of spot contracts so as to reduce any currency exposure to a minimal amount.
The Group is also subject to a structural currency exposure on its net investments in overseas subsidiaries primarily in Switzerland and the British Virgin Islands.

Financial risk management continued The table below summarises the Groups exposure to foreign currency exchange risk at 31 December.
Included in the table are the Groups assets and liabilities, at carrying amounts, categorised by currency.
com Report and accounts 2005 Page 77 Credit risk The Group takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due.
Significant changes in the economy or in the health of a particular sector could result in losses that are different from those that the Group has provided for at the balance sheet date.
The Group structures the levels of credit risk it undertakes by placing limits on the amount of risk accepted in relation to borrowers or groups of borrowers and to geographical and industry segments.
It is the Groups policy to place funds generated internally and from banking clients with a range of high quality financial institutions.
Investments are spread to avoid excessive exposure to any individual counterparty.
Loans made to clients are fully secured against clients assets that are held by Group companies.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through regular analysis of the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to meet repayment obligations and by changing the lending limits where appropriate.
Liquidity risk The Treasury Department has primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with the Groups liquidity policy, which requires that the Bank maintains a surplus of immediately realisable assets over its liabilities such that all known and potential cash obligations can be met.
Liquidity mismatches are monitored on a daily basis against the liquidity limits set by the Banking Committee and the FSAs liquidity mismatch guidelines.
Liquidity risk is primarily managed by holding marketable instruments which are realisable at short notice.
The table below analyses the Groups financial assets and liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to contractual maturity date.
