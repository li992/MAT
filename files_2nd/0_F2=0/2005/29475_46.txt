PENSION ARRANGEMENTS The total cost of employer contributions to defined contribution personal pension plans for SJPCs employees during the year was 2.0 million 2004: 2.0 million.
Employer contributions to the defined contribution section of the occupational pension scheme, which is operated for SJPCs senior employees, for the year totalled 0.4 million 2004: 0.3 million.
The defined benefits section of the occupational scheme is closed to new members and has no active members.
Accordingly there have been no employer contributions during the year.
The residual liabilities to the current and deferred pensioners have been matched by purchased annuities both immediate and deferred from insurance companies and therefore no surplus or deficit will arise.
