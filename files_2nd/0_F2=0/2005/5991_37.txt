22 Financial instruments a Financial Risks The principal financial risks to the group are interest rate and exchange rate uctuation risks.
Throughout the year the group has used its long-term borrowing facility, on which interest is paid at rates variable with LIBOR, as its principal source of borrowings.
All of the groups other borrowings are of a short-term nature and the groups policy is to only use them as such.
At the year end 96% of the groups net bank borrowings were drawn under the long-term facility.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge the interest rate risk on a proportion of the groups borrowings.
There were no significant unrealised gains or losses on such transactions at the year end.
The remittances of the groups overseas subsidiaries in Hong Kong and US dollars provide a natural hedge against part of the groups foreign currency purchasing requirements in the UK.
In addition, the group enters into forward exchange contracts for the purchase of foreign currencies, based on forecast requirements, to minimise short term exposure to exchange rate uctuations.
At 31 March 2005 there were contracts outstanding totalling 13.8m 2004: 19.9m.
There were no significant unrealised gains or losses at the year end.
b Financial assets The group has no financial assets other than cash at bank and in hand which is deposited at short-term bank rates.
There is no material difference at either 31 March 2005 or 31 March 2004 between the book values and the fair values of the groups financial assets.
