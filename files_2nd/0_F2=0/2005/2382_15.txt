Notes on financial statements continued 4 Discontinued operations BP announced on 7 October 2005 its intention to sell Innovene, its olefins, derivatives and refining group, to INEOS.
The transaction became unconditional on 9 December 2005 on receipt of European Commission clearance and was completed on 16 December 2005.
The transaction included all Innovenes manufacturing sites, markets and technologies.
The equity-accounted investments in China and Malaysia that were part of the Olefins and Derivatives business remain with BP and are included within Other businesses and corporate.
The Innovene operations represented a separate major line of business for BP.
As a result of the sale, these operations have been treated as discontinued operations for the year ended 31 December 2005.
A single amount is shown on the face of the income statement comprising the post-tax result of discontinued operations and the post-tax loss recognized on the remeasurement to fair value less costs to sell and on disposal of the discontinued operation.
That is, the income and expenses of Innovene are reported separately from the continuing operations of the BP group.
The table below provides further detail of the amount shown on the income statement.
The income statements for prior periods have been restated to conform to this style of presentation.
In the cash flow statement, the cash provided by the operating activities of Innovene has been separated from that of the rest of the group and reported as a single line item.
Gross proceeds received amounted to $8,477 million.
There were selling costs of $120 million and initial closing adjustments of $43 million.
The proceeds are subject to final closing adjustments.
The remeasurement to fair value less costs to sell resulted in a loss of $591 million before tax.
The originally announced transaction value of $9,000 million has been reduced by the value of certain liabilities transferred to INEOS and certain assets retained by BP on closing.
