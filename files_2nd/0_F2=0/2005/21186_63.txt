Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 164 Financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 42 Pension obligations a Introduction The Group operates a large number of pension schemes around the world, whose members receive benets on either a dened benefit basis generally related to final salary or a dened contribution basis.
The only material dened benefit schemes are in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada and Ireland and, of these, the main United Kingdom scheme is by far the largest.
The assets of the main United Kingdom, Irish and Canadian schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds and, in the Netherlands, the main scheme is held in a separate foundation which invests in the life funds of the Group.
An actuarial report has been submitted for each of the dened benefit schemes within the last three years, using appropriate methods for the respective countries on local funding bases.
In the United Kingdom, the Group operates one main pension scheme, the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme.
New entrants join the dened contribution section of the scheme, as the dened benefit section is closed to new employees.
For funding purposes, the scheme was valued as at an effective date of 1 April 2005, on a market value basis using the Projected Unit Method.
The employing companies contributions to the dened benefit section of the scheme throughout 2005 were 29% of employees pensionable salaries together with the cost of redundancies during the year and an additional payment of 51 million.
As this section of the scheme is closed to new entrants and the contribution rate is determined using the projected unit method, it is expected that the percentage cost of providing future service benets will increase as the membership ages.
The employers contribution rate for 2006 has therefore been increased to 35% of pensionable salaries expected to be 119 million.
The Group has also decided to make further contributions of 540 million into this and the RAC schemes over the next two years.
The contribution rates for members of the dened contribution section throughout 2005 were 8% of pensionable salaries, together with further contributions up to 4% where members contribute, and the cost of the death-in-service benets.
These contribution rates are unchanged for 2006.
The acquisition of RAC plc in May 2005 has resulted in the main RAC scheme now being included in the UK disclosures that follow.
A one-off payment of 160 million for deficit funding was made into that scheme during the year, which together with the 540 million allocated above, will bring total additional contributions into the two schemes to 700 million.
Disclosures under the amendment to IAS 19 issued in December 2004 for the material schemes in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada and Ireland are provided in the following pages.
Total pension costs for these schemes have been calculated under IAS 19.
Excluding the deficit funding discussed above, total employer contributions for these schemes in 2006 are expected to be 259 million.
b Charges to the income statement The total pension costs of the Groups dened benefit and dened contribution schemes were: 2005 2004 m m UK dened benefit schemes 141 106 UK dened contribution schemes 33 31 Overseas dened benefit schemes 17 52 Overseas dened contribution schemes 14 16 205 205 There were no significant contributions outstanding or prepaid as at either 31 December 2005 or 2004.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 165 42 Pension obligations continued c Details of the material dened benefit schemes i The valuation used for accounting under IAS 19 has been based on the most recent full actuarial valuations, updated to take account of that standards requirements in order to assess the liabilities of the material schemes at 31 December 2005.
The updating was made by actuaries in each country who, other than the actuary of the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme and Dutch arrangements, were independent of the Group.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at 31 December 2005.
The details for the material dened benefit schemes are shown below.
Where schemes provide both dened benefit and dened contribution pensions, the assets and liabilities shown exclude those relating to dened contribution pensions.
UK Netherlands Canada Ireland 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 Date of most recent actuarial valuation 1.4.
The discount rate is the assumption that has the largest impact on the value of the liabilities.
A 1% increase in this rate would reduce the liabilities by 1.7 billion.
The UK schemes are by far the most material to the Group.
The post-retirement mortality base table used for these schemes is PA92 calendar year 2006 with a one-year age rating deduction schemes, which is considered appropriate based on the mortality experience of the schemes.
In addition, post-retirement mortality improvements are allowed for through a reduction to the discount rate of 30 basis points which is considered a best estimate.
However, the extent of future improvements in longevity is subject to considerable uncertainty and judgement is required in setting this assumption.
Increasing the allowance by 10 basis points to a 40 basis point reduction to the discount rate would increase the schemes liabilities by 150 million.
The expected returns are developed in conjunction with external advisers and take into account both current market expectations of future returns, where available, and historical returns.

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in the statement of recognised income and expenses since 1 January 2004 the date of transition to IFRS is 692 million at 31 December 2005 2004: 145 million.

Where the investment and insurance policies are in segregated funds with specic asset allocations, they are included in the appropriate line in the table above, otherwise they appear in Other.
The Dutch insurance policies comprise virtually all the assets in each of the first three lines of the relevant column above, whilst the UK policies are included in Other.
These insurance policies, totalling 875 million 2004: 813 million are considered non-transferable under the terms of IAS 19 and so have been treated as other obligations to staff pension schemes within provisions see note 41.
Excluding these policies, the total fair value of scheme assets is 7,334 million 2004 : 5,473 million and the total IAS 19 obligations to the schemes are therefore 2,346 million 2004: 1,706 million.

In the United Kingdom, the value of the liabilities has increased due to lower corporate bond yields, which are used to set the valuation discount rate, a higher assumed ination rate and a strengthening to the post-retirement mortality future improvements allowed for in the basis.
The increase in scheme assets is primarily due to an improvement in equity and bond values since the previous year end, together with deficit contribution payments made by the employing companies.
The deficit has further increased by 313 million as a result of the acquisition of the RAC group in May 2005.
