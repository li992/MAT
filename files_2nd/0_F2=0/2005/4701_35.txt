The larger plans are generally of the dened benefit type and are funded by payments to separately administered funds or insurance companies.
The principal plans are in the United Kingdom, Ireland, United States and Canada.
All valuations were performed by independent actuaries using the projected unit method to determine pension costs.
There are also a number of dened contribution plans and other post employment liabilities which are included in the gures given below.
The group also operates a number of plans, primarily in the United States, which provide employees with post employment benets in respect of medical costs.
The plans are generally unfunded.
The most recent full valuations of the significant dened benefit post employment plans were carried out as follows: United Kingdom on 31 March 2003: United States on 31 December 2004: and Ireland on 31 December 2003.
The measurement dates used to calculate the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are the respective balance sheet dates.

The assumptions used to calculate the profit and loss charge credit for the year to 30 June are based on the assumptions disclosed as at the previous 30 June.

The expected long term rates of return for equities have been determined by reference to government bond rates minimum risk rates in the countries in which the plans are based.
To reect the additional risks associated with equities, expected long term rates of return on equities include a risk premium of 3.25% per year as at 30 June 2005 2004 3.25%: 2003 3% in excess of the expected return from government bonds.
These risk premiums are long term assumptions and were set after taking actuarial advice and considering the assumptions used by other FTSE 100 companies.
The expected long term rates of return for other assets are determined in a similar way, i. e. by using an appropriate risk premium relative to government bonds in the relevant country.
The groups investment strategy for its funded post employment plans is decided locally by Diageo and, if relevant, the trustees of the plan, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements.
The groups objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in excess of the return on the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specic allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the target rate of return.
Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention being that this will result in the ongoing cost to the group of the post employment plans being lower over the long term and be within acceptable boundaries of risk.
Each investment strategy is also designed to control investment risk by managing allocations to asset classes, geographical exposures and individual stock exposures.
For the United Kingdom pension fund the policy is to invest approximately 85% of the assets in equities, 5% in bonds and 10% in property.
For the principal Irish pension scheme the policy is to invest approximately 70% of the assets in equities, 20% in bonds and 10% in property.
