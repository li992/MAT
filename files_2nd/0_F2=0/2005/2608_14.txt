Burberry Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 47 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Basis of preparation Burberry Group is a luxury goods manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific: licensing activity is also carried out, principally in Japan.
All of the companies, which comprise the Burberry Group, are owned by Burberry Group plc the Company directly or indirectly.
The financial information has been prepared by consolidating the historical financial information for each of the companies that comprise Burberry Group from applicable individual financial returns of these companies for the years to 31 March 2005 and 2004.
Burberry Group reorganisation Immediately prior to the flotation on the London Stock Exchange in July 2002, a reorganisation of Burberry Group took place resulting in Burberry Group directly owning all Burberry Group companies.
Prior to this, a number of Burberry Group entities and certain Burberry-related assets and liabilities together the Net Assets were held underneath GUS group companies although Burberry Group indirectly controlled them and had the economic rights to, and was exposed to the risks in, the Net Assets.
The Net Assets were accounted for as quasi-subsidiaries in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 5 Reporting the substance of transactions and were thus consolidated as if their legal ownership rested with Burberry Group.
The reorganisation involved the acquisition by Burberry Group of the legal ownership of the Net Assets and the disposal to GUS group of those assets and liabilities which did not form part of the Burberry Group post-flotation.
Burberry Group financed this reorganisation using loans from GUS group: such loans were repaid by a rights issue of Ordinary Share capital to GUS group, by loan repayment out of the proceeds of the Companys flotation on the London Stock Exchange and by the waiver of the remaining debt by GUS group.
These transactions created a premium on the legal acquisition of the Net Assets of 704.1m the Premium.
The accounting treatment required by Schedule 4A to the Companies Act 1985 would recognise the Premium as goodwill.
However, the directors consider that, in substance, the Premium represents the value that has been transferred outside of Burberry Group as a result of these transactions.
In effect, Burberry Group made a payment to GUS group for assets that it already controlled prior to the reorganisation.
Consequently, in order to meet the overriding requirement of the Companies Act 1985 to show a true and fair view, the Premium has been treated as a distribution to GUS group out of the consolidated reserves of Burberry Group the Deemed distribution.
The directors consider that it is not meaningful to quantify the effects of this departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
As a result of the Deemed distribution, a net deficit arose on the accumulated profit and loss account in the Burberry Group consolidated balance sheet.
In order to eliminate this deficit on consolidation an other reserve of 704.1m was created in the Companys own balance sheet by the transfer of this sum from the share premium account, following High Court approval of the capital reduction, shortly before the admission of the Companys Ordinary Shares to trading by the London Stock Exchange.
This other reserve was reclassified as distributable, and included in the profit and loss account reserve, when all the Companys creditors in existence on 17 July 2002 the date of approval of the capital reduction were settled in full, on 31 December 2003.
2 Accounting policies The consolidated financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified by the revaluation of certain fixed assets, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the UK and the Companies Act 1985.
The principal accounting policies, which have been consistently applied, are: a Turnover Turnover, which is stated excluding VAT and other sales taxes, is the amount receivable for goods supplied less returns, trade discounts and allowances and royalties receivable.
Wholesale sales are recognised when goods are despatched to trade customers, with provisions made for expected returns and allowances as necessary.
Retail sales, returns and allowances are reflected at the dates of transactions with consumers, in addition provisions are made for expected returns as necessary.
Royalty receivable from licensees is accrued as earned on the basis of the terms of the relevant royalty agreement, which is typically on the basis of production volumes.
b Intangible fixed assets Goodwill For acquisitions of companies or businesses made on or after 1 April 1998, goodwill being the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is capitalised as an intangible fixed asset.
Fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets and liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that date.
Adjustments are also made to bring the accounting policies of acquired businesses into alignment with those of Burberry Group.
Goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1 April 1998 was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition.
On the disposal of a business, any goodwill previously written off against reserves in Burberry Group is included in the profit or loss on disposal.
48 Burberry Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2 Accounting policies continued b Intangible fixed assets continued Goodwill on acquisitions after 1 April 1998 is capitalised and amortised by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic life, not exceeding 20 years, taking into account the nature of the business acquired and other competitive considerations.
The useful economic life of goodwill arising is determined on a case-by-case basis.
Impairment reviews are performed if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Trademarks and other intellectual property The cost of securing and renewing trademarks and other intellectual property is capitalised as an intangible fixed asset and amortised by equal annual instalments over its useful economic life, typically ten years.
The useful economic life of trademarks and other intellectual property is determined on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreement.
c Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or revalued amount where relevant, less depreciation.
Depreciation Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated to write off the cost or revalued amount, less residual value, of the assets in equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives at the following rates: Land Not depreciated Freehold buildings Up to 50 years Leaseholds less than 50 years expired Over the unexpired term of the lease Plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 3 8 years Retail fixtures and fittings 2 5 years Office equipment 5 years Computer software and equipment 3 5 years Lease premiums Amounts paid to acquire the rights to a lease Lease Premiums are written off in equal annual instalments over the life of the lease or to the next rental review.
Valuations Burberry Group has adopted a policy of not revaluing properties as permitted under Financial Reporting Standard 15 Tangible Fixed Assets.
Previously revalued properties are included at their valuation at 31 March 1996, less depreciation.
Impairment Impairment reviews are undertaken when performance trends or changes in circumstances suggest that the net book value of a fixed asset is not fully recoverable.
Profit loss on disposal of fixed assets Profits and losses on disposal of tangible fixed assets represent the difference between the net proceeds and net book value at the date of sale.
Disposals are accounted for when the relevant transaction becomes unconditional.
d Investments in group companies Investments held by the Company are carried at cost less amounts written off in respect of impairment.
When investments are fully or partially hedged by means of foreign currency borrowings, the hedged proportion of those investments is retranslated at the relevant exchange rate and the resulting exchange difference taken to reserves along with the matching exchange difference on the foreign currency borrowings.
e Stock Stock and work in progress are valued on a first-in-first-out basis at the lower of cost including an appropriate proportion of production overhead and net realisable value.
Provision is made to reduce cost to no more than net realisable value having regard to the age and condition of stock, as well as its anticipated saleability.
f Deferred tax Deferred taxation is recognised as a liability or asset if transactions have occurred at the balance sheet date that give rise to an obligation to pay more taxation in future, or a right to pay less taxation in future.
An asset is not recognised to the extent that the realisation of economic benefits in the future is uncertain.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
Deferred tax would be provided where remittance is anticipated and is expected to result in a charge to taxation.
Burberry Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 49 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2 Accounting policies continued g Pension costs The pension costs in the consolidated financial statements are determined in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits.
GUS defined benefit schemes Eligible employees of Burberry Group participate in a number of GUS defined benefit schemes throughout the world: the principal defined benefit schemes are in the UK.
The assets covering these arrangements are held in independently administered funds.
The cost of providing defined pension benefits to participating Burberry employees is charged to the profit and loss account of Burberry Group over the anticipated period of employment, in accordance with recommendations made by independent qualified actuaries.
Variation from regular cost is allocated over the expected remaining service lines of current scheme members.
Any difference between the cumulative amounts charged against profit and contributions paid is included as an asset or liability as appropriate in the balance sheet.
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit schemes represents Burberrys share of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and part service costs.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in intervening years.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2004 by independent, qualified actuaries, using the projected unit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly to equity through the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Defined contribution schemes Burberry Group eligible employees also participate in GUS group defined contribution pension schemes, the principal one being in the UK with its assets held in an independently administered fund.
The cost of providing these benefits to participating Burberry employees is recognised in the profit and loss account of Burberry Group and comprises the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the year.
h Share schemes Incentive plans The fair market value of the shares at the date of the grant, less any consideration receivable from the participating Burberry employee, is charged to the profit and loss account.
Where awards are contingent upon future events other than continued employment, an assessment of the likelihood of these conditions being achieved is made at the end of each reporting period and an appropriate accrual made over the period to which the participating Burberry employees performance relates.
Where awards are not contingent upon future events a full accrual is made immediately in the profit and loss account.
Save As You Earn scheme GUS plc operates a Save As You Earn scheme in which certain UK employees of Burberry Group participate that allows for the grant of GUS plc ordinary shares at a discount to the market price at the date of the grant.
Burberry Group has adopted the provision of the revised UITF Abstract 17 Employee Share Schemes concerning the recognition of the cost of employee share incentive schemes.
The cost of Employee Share Schemes is charged to the profit and loss account using the quoted market price of the shares at the date of the grant less the exercise price of the share options granted.
The charge is accrued over the performance period of the awards.
i Foreign currency translation Translation of the results of overseas businesses The results of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
The assets and liabilities of such undertakings are translated at year end exchange rates.
Differences arising on the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiary companies, and on the translation of their results, are taken to reserves and are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The principal exchange rates used were as follows: Average Closing Year to 31 March As at 31 March 2005 2004 2005 2004 Euro 1.47 1.44 1.45 1.50 US dollar 1.85 1.70 1.88 1.84 Hong Kong dollar 14.40 13.20 14.69 14.31 Korean won 2,041 2,016 1,920 2,106 The average exchange rate achieved by Burberry Group on its Yen royalty income, taking into account its use of Yen forward sale contracts on a monthly basis approximately 12 months in advance of royalty receipts, was Yen 184.3: 1 in the year to 31 March 2005 2004: Yen 182.3: 1.
50 Burberry Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2 Accounting policies continued i Foreign currency translation continued Transactions in foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the forward contract rate where hedged.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies which are held at year end are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date or at the forward contract rate where specifically hedged.
Exchange differences on monetary items are taken to the profit and loss account except where they relate to intercompany loans hedging investments in overseas subsidiaries of Burberry Group, in which case such differences including attributable taxation are taken directly to reserves and limited to the foreign currency movement on the underlying investment.
j Financial instruments Burberry Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates arising on certain trading transactions.
The principal derivative instruments used are forward currency contracts taken out to hedge certain future royalty receivables and product purchases.
Gains and losses on such forward currency contracts are recognised in the profit and loss account at the same date as the underlying transaction.
The financial instruments used and managed by Burberry Group consist primarily of cash and forward currency contracts used to hedge currency exposures on trading transactions.
Burberry Group has taken advantage of the exemption available under Financial Reporting Standard 13 Derivatives and Financial Instruments, in respect of short term debtors and creditors, and details in respect of these balances are excluded from the required disclosures, other than within the currency risk disclosure.
k Operating leases The Burberry Group is both a lessee and lessor of property.
Gross rental income and expenditure in respect of operating leases are recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the leases.
Certain rental expense is determined on the basis of turnover achieved in specific retail locations and is accrued for on that basis.
l Related party transactions Financial Reporting Standard 8 Related Party Disclosures FRS 8, requires the disclosure of the details of material transactions between the reporting entity and related parties.
Burberry Group has taken advantage of an exemption under FRS 8 not to disclose transactions between Burberry Group companies, which eliminate on consolidation.
3 Changes in accounting policy and presentation The results for the year to 31 March 2004 have been restated following the adoption of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts and UITF Abstract 17 Employee Share Schemes.
Impact of adopting FRS 17 Retirement Benefits FRS 17 Following the actuarial valuation of the GUS defined benefit pension scheme as at 31 March 2004 it has become possible to identify the liabilities that arise from Burberry employees who participate in the scheme.
This valuation was completed in January 2005 and Burberry Group has decided to adopt FRS 17.
The allocation of assets held, in an independently administered fund, have been allocated in proportion to the liabilities arising and the net impact is recorded in pension obligations.
The impact of adopting FRS 17 on the profit and loss account for the year to 31 March 2005 is not material.
Previously the Group accounted for pension costs under SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The impact of the above treatment is to: a Reduce accruals and provisions by 0.9m as at 31 March 2004: b Increase pension obligations by 2.0m as at 31 March 2004: c Increase operating profit by 1.4m for the year to 31 March 2004: d Increase interest and similar income by 0.1m for the year to 31 March 2004: and e Reduce the profit and loss reserve account by 1.4m as at 31 March 2004.
Impact of adopting UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts UITF 38 Shares held by the Burberry Group plc ESOP Trust and the Burberry Group Share Incentive Plan the Burberry Group ESOPs, previously shown in the balance sheet as fixed asset investments, are now required to be shown as a deduction from Shareholders Funds.
The consideration paid and the related allocations of these shares to employees, are included as an adjustment to the profit and loss reserve account.
The impact of the treatment for the Group is to: a Reduce fixed asset investments by 8.7m as at 31 March 2004: b Reduce accruals and deferred income by 2.4m as at 31 March 2004: and c Reduce the profit and loss reserve account by 6.3m as at 31 March 2004.
Burberry Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 51 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3 Changes in accounting policy and presentation continued Impact of adopting UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts continued There is no impact on the profit and loss account as a result of adopting UITF 38 in either the current or comparative year.
The consolidated cash flow statement has been restated to reflect the reallocation of the cash payments relating to the purchase of shares from Capital expenditure and financial investment to Financing.
The impact of the treatment for the Company is to: a Reduce fixed asset investments by 8.7m as at 31 March 2004: and b Reduce the profit and loss reserve account by 8.7m as at 31 March 2004.
The impact of adopting UITF Abstract 17 Employee Share Schemes The Group has also adopted the provision of the revised UITF Abstract 17 Employee Share Schemes concerning the recognition of the cost of employee share incentive schemes.
The cost of Employee Share Schemes is now charged to the profit and loss account using the quoted market price of the shares at the date of the grant less the exercise price of the share options granted.
Previously the amount charged was calculated with reference to the cost of own shares.
There is no material effect on profit before taxation in either the current or the prior periods.

Accordingly, the directors do not consider that an analysis of the profit and loss account within the Wholesale and Retail business would be meaningful.

However, as this will be offset by an increase in share capital and share premium, there will be no net impact on Burberry Groups consolidated Shareholders Funds.
Cumulative goodwill charged to reserves on acquisition before 1 April 1998 is 0.1m 2004: 0.1m.
Investment in own shares The cost of own shares held in the Burberry Group ESOPs has been offset against the profit and loss reserve account as the amounts paid reduce the profits available for distribution by the Burberry Group and the Company.
As at 31 March 2005 the amounts offset against this reserve account are 19.0m 2004: 12.1m.

These shares are held to meet the share option award obligations arising on the 2004 RSP, the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002, the Burberry Group plc Co-investment Plan and All Employee Share Plans.

Under certain turnover leases there are no minimums and therefore no financial commitment is included in the table above.
As a result, the amounts charged to the profit and loss account may be materially higher than the financial commitment at the prior year end.
30 Capital commitments Capital commitments contracted but not provided for by Burberry Group as at 31 March 2005 amounted to 9.7m 2004: 14.2m.
Contracted capital commitments represent contracts entered into by the year end and major capital expenditure projects where activity has commenced by the year end.
31 Contingent liabilities Since 31 March 2004 the following changes to contingent liabilities have occurred: In the year to 31 March 2002, the Group received an invoice for 0.5m in respect of construction works at the Bond Street site from its former lessor.
The Burberry Group notified the other party that it was seeking recovery of certain costs incurred because of the late delivery of the store structure.
During the year this matter was settled and the Burberry Group made a payment of 0.5m.
The Group was named as one of approximately 100 defendants in a class action in California, US, which alleges that employees job application processes violated the Californian Labor Code.
This action has been settled for less than 0.1m.
Other contingent liabilities reported at 31 March 2004 remain unchanged and were: Under the GUS group UK tax payment arrangements, the Group is and will remain jointly and severally liable for any GUS liability attributable to the period of Burberry Groups membership of this payment scheme.
Burberry Groups membership of this scheme was terminated with effect from 31 March 2002.
Burberry Spain S. A. is liable for certain salary and social security contributions left unpaid by its sole contractors where the amounts are attributable to the period in which subcontracting activity is undertaken on behalf of Burberry Spain S. A.
It is not feasible to estimate the amount of contingent liability, but such expense has been minimal in prior years.
The Group has received a claim from the liquidator of Creation Cent Mille SA CCM a former licensee of Burberry Group, seeking to set aside the termination of the licence agreement between Burberry Limited and CCM.
Burberry Group believes this claim is without merit and has continued to vigorously defend itself.
Burberry Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 71 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 32 Financial risk management Burberry Groups policies are as follows: Liquidity and treasury management Burberry Groups management seeks to reduce financial risk and to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
Burberry Groups treasury function does not operate as a profit centre and transacts only in relation to the underlying business requirements.
Currency risk management Burberry Groups management has monitored the desirability of hedging the profits and net assets of overseas subsidiaries when translated into Sterling for reporting purposes.
It has not entered into any specific transactions for this purpose.
Burberry Groups profit and loss account is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency.
To reduce exposure to currency fluctuations, Burberry Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward exchange contracts where appropriate.
Burberry Groups principal foreign currency denominated transactions arise from royalty income and the sale and purchase of overseas sourced products.
In the UK, Burberry Group manages these exposures by the use of Yen and Euro forward exchange contracts for a period of 12 months in advance.
In addition, Burberry Groups overseas subsidiaries hedge the foreign currency element of their product purchases on a seasonal basis.
The hedging activity involves the use of spot and forward currency instruments.
a Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of Burberry Groups financial assets and financial liabilities: Book and fair value as at 31 March 2005 2004 m m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations: Investment 0.1 0.1 Cash at bank and in hand 62.4 42.6 Short term deposits 107.5 116.1 Total financial assets 170.0 158.8 Overdrafts 0.8 Other financial liabilities see note 32 d 41.0 39.6 Total financial liabilities 41.0 40.4 Total net financial investments 129.0 118.4 2005 2004 m m Derivative financial instruments held to manage the currency profile: Forward foreign currency contracts Book value Fair value 5.7 3.6 Fair value methods and assumptions Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
The principal assumptions are: i The fair value of short term deposits, loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
ii The fair value of foreign currency contracts is based on a comparison of the contractual and year end spot exchange rates.

Currently, Burberry Group is not permitting new entrants to the GUS defined benefit pension scheme.
The GUS scheme has rules which specify the benefits to be paid and is financed accordingly, with assets being held in independently administered funds.
A full actuarial valuation of the GUS scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2004 by independent qualified actuaries, Watson Wyatt LLP, using the projected unit method.
As a result of the 31 March 2004 valuation it has become possible to separately identify the underlying assets and liabilities which relate to the Burberry Group and so FRS 17 Retirement Benefits has been adopted during the year with comparative data restated accordingly, see note 3.
As at 31 March 2005 there were 64 2004: 80 Burberry Group employees in the scheme and Burberry Group contributions represented approximately 7.7% 2004: 7.2% of total employer contributions to the scheme.
Burberry has been contributing 17.9% 2004: 17.9% in respect of members in the main benefit section.
During the year to 31 March 2005 GUS made a special contribution to the scheme of 26.2m 2004: 30.0m in order to fund the shortfall disclosed by the interim valuation on the ongoing actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes.
Burberry Groups share of this contribution is estimated at 2.0m 2004: 2.3m.
The deficit for the GUS group defined benefit pension scheme as a whole, on the basis set out below, was approximately 6.6m as at 31 March 2005 2004: 47.9m, after allowing for the 26.2m 2004: 30.0m special contribution paid in March 2005 and before allowing for deferred tax.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of the Burberry Group portion of the GUS group defined benefit pension scheme are the same as these used for the whole GUS group defined benefit pension scheme and are: As at 31 March 2005 2004 2003 Rate of inflation 2.9% 2.8% 2.5% Rate of salary increases 4.7% 4.6% 4.3% Rate of increase for pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.9% 2.8% 2.5% Discount rate 5.4% 5.5% 5.5% Burberry Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 77
