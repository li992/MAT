Notes to the consolidated financial statements 37 Reconciliation of the consolidated balance sheets from UK GAAP to IFRS continued Deferred tax Under UK GAAP, the subsequent recognition of deferred tax assets not originally recognised at the time of an acquisition was recorded as a deferred tax asset and a tax credit in the consolidated income statement.
Under IFRS, subsequent recognition also gives rise to a reduction in goodwill and a corresponding operating expense in the consolidated income statement.
Under UK GAAP, deferred tax assets are classified as debtors and deferred tax liabilities are classified as provisions in the consolidated balance sheet excluding retirement benefits.
Under IFRS, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented separately as non current assets and non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
At 1 January 2004 under IFRS, deferred tax assets of 22m are reclassified from current assets to non current assets.
The impact of retirement benefit obligation adjustments increases deferred tax assets by 5m and the impact of all other adjustments increases goodwill by 1m and net deferred tax assets by 1m.
At 31 December 2004 under IFRS, due to the subsequent recognition of deferred tax assets not originally recognised at the time of an acquisition, goodwill reduces by 9m.
Deferred tax assets of 36m are reclassified from current assets to non current assets.
The impact of retirement benefit obligation adjustments increases deferred tax assets by 5m.
The impact of all other adjustments increases goodwill by 2m and increases net deferred tax assets by 2m.
Acquisitions Under UK GAAP, fair value adjustments to assets and liabilities were permitted up to the end of the year following the year of the acquisition and recognised in the year when the adjustments were made.
Under IFRS, fair value adjustments to assets and liabilities are permitted up to one year following the acquisition and are recognised retrospectively in the consolidated financial statements.
At 1 January 2004 under IFRS, net assets reduce by 10m due to 2004 fair value adjustments on 2003 acquisitions.
There was no IFRS impact in respect of acquisitions at 31 December 2004.
Other At 1 January 2004 under IFRS, other adjustments include an 8m increase in property, plant and equipment and in borrowings with respect to the reclassification of a lease and a 4m increase in other payables due to the reclassification of certain employee benefits.
At 31 December 2004 under IFRS, other adjustments include 8m of exchange losses transferred to other reserves from retained earnings.
