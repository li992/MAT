Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 93 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards a The Group has adopted International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005.
In order to show comparative balances, the year ended 31 December 2004 is also shown under IFRS.
The date of transition to IFRS is 1 January 2004.
In general, a company is required to determine its IFRS accounting policies and apply these retrospectively to determine its opening balance sheet under IFRS.
However, International Financial Reporting Standard 1, First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS 1 allows a number of exemptions to this general principle upon adoption of IFRS.
The Group has taken advantage of the following transitional arrangements.
Business combinations The Group has elected not to apply retrospectively the provisions of IFRS 3, Business Combinations, to business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004.
At the date of transition, no adjustment was made between UK GAAP and IFRS for any historical business combination.
Cumulative translation differences The Group has elected that the cumulative translation differences of foreign operations were deemed to be zero at the transition date to IFRS.
Equity compensation plans The Group has elected not to apply the provisions of IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, to options and awards granted on or before 7 November 2002 which had not vested by 1 January 2005.
Employee benets All cumulative actuarial gains and losses on the Groups dened benefit pension schemes have been recognised in equity at the transition date.
Comparatives The Group has not taken advantage of the exemption within IFRS 1 that allows comparative information presented in the first year of adoption of IFRS not to comply with IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts.
Estimates Where estimates had previously been made under UK GAAP, consistent estimates after adjustments to reect any difference in accounting policies have been made for the same date on transition to IFRS ie judgements affecting the Groups opening balance sheet have not been revisited for the benefit of hindsight.
Held for sale The requirements of International Financial Reporting Standard 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, have been applied prospectively from 1 January 2005.
Transitional provisions The Group has elected to disclose only five years of data in its loss development tables, as permitted by IFRS 4 in the year of adoption of IFRS.
This will be increased in each succeeding additional year, until the full ten years of information is included.

Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 98 Financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards continued iii Notes to the analysis of adjustments to the balance sheets as at 1 January and 31 December 2004 as a result of the transition to IFRS The UK GAAP balance sheet has been presented in a format consistent with IFRS.
The only significant change in heading is that the Fund for Future Appropriations is now renamed the Unallocated Divisible Surplus.
The basis for the material adjustments between UK GAAP and IFRS is as follows: 1 Investment valuation The adjustments in respect of investment valuation arise from the following: 1 January 31 December 2004 2004 m m Increase in valuation of debt securities 1,718 2,459 Change in valuation of certain mortgages 113 119 Other sundry adjustments 23 21 1,854 2,599 The principal changes are discussed further below: a Debt securities Under UK GAAP, equity securities and unit trusts are carried at current value.
Debt and other xed income securities are carried at current value, with the exception of many non-linked long-term business debt securities and xed income securities, which are carried at amortised cost.
As a result of applying IAS 39, the Group now carries all investments in debt and equity securities at fair value.
The change in valuation of debt securities from amortised cost to fair value increases the valuation of investments by 1,718 million at 1 January 2004 and 2,459 million at 31 December 2004.
This change in the valuation of debt securities is largely offset by corresponding movements in the unallocated divisible surplus and technical liabilities.
The net impact on shareholders funds at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 is to increase them by 191 million and 284 million respectively.
b Commercial mortgages backing certain annuity business Under IFRS, the Group has chosen to move certain of its commercial mortgage portfolio to an active fair valuation basis in accordance with IAS39, which has increased the value of investments by 113 million at 1 January 2004 and 119 million at 31 December 2004.
The annuity liabilities which are backed by these assets have been correspondingly revalued, with the result that there is an insignicant impact on shareholders funds at either date.
c Revaluation reserve Under IFRS, certain investment gains are recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity, whereas under UK GAAP they would be included in retained earnings.
Separate revaluation reserves are created for: Changes in the fair value of securities classied as available for sale: Changes in the value of owner-occupied property: Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and from borrowings designated as hedges of such items: and Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ow hedges.
The amounts included in the above reserves are, where appropriate, net of deferred tax and impairment losses.
The above requirements have resulted in transfers from retained earnings into separate revaluation reserves of 543 million and 736 million at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 respectively.
2 Insurance changes The impact on shareholders funds of insurance changes is as follows: 1 January 31 December 2004 2004 m m Derecognition of claims equalisation provision 364 388 Change in the value of reinsurance treaties 48 34 Application of an active liability valuation basis in the Netherlands 7 52 Change in value of non-participating investment contracts and other sundry items 67 136 242 166 The principal changes to the Groups insurance accounting upon transition to IFRS are discussed further below.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 99 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards continued a Product classication IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, requires all products issued to be classied for accounting purposes as either insurance or investment contracts, depending on whether significant insurance risk exists.
In the case of a life contract, insurance risk exists if the amount payable on death differs from the amount payable if the policyholder survives.
The Group has deemed insurance risk to be significant if the difference exceeds 5% of the policy value, although the classication would be similar if a 10% test had been used.
Following a detailed review, 61% of life policy reserves on an modied statutory solvency basis MSSB at 31 December 2003 31 December 2004: 59% have been classied as insurance and 24% at both dates have been classied as participating investment contracts being those investment contracts containing a discretionary participating feature as dened within IFRS 4.
Both classes will continue to be accounted for under the Groups existing accounting policies.
The remaining 15% 31 December 2004: 17% have been classied as non-participating investment contracts and therefore are required to be accounted for under IAS 39 and IAS 18, Revenue.
Virtually all our general insurance products are classied as insurance.
This product classication change has led to technical provisions being allocated between insurance and investment contracts.
This has resulted in 57,445 million and 69,555 million of liabilities at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 respectively being classied as investment contracts.
b Equalisation provision An equalisation provision is recorded in the balance sheets of individual general insurance companies in the United Kingdom and in a limited number of other countries, to eliminate or reduce the volatility in incurred claims arising from exceptional levels of claims in certain classes of business.
The provision is required by law even though no actual liability exists at the balance sheet date and is included in the UK GAAP consolidated balance sheet.
The annual change in the equalisation provision is recorded in the UK GAAP profit and loss account.
Under IFRS, no equalisation provision is recorded, as no actual liability exists at the balance sheet date.
There are increases of 364 million and 388 million in shareholders funds at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 respectively as a result of the removal of this provision.
c Reinsurance treaties Following a full review of all our reinsurance contracts, a small number of the Groups long-term reinsurance treaties have been revalued under IFRS, leading to reductions in the value of reinsurance assets of 134 million and 108 million at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 respectively.
The majority of these changes relate to participating contracts and so these value changes principally affect the unallocated divisible surplus rather than shareholders funds.
d Application of an active liability valuation basis in the Netherlands The conversion to IFRS has been a particular issue in the Dutch industry where, traditionally, both bond investments and associated insurance liabilities have been held at amortised cost.
IAS 39 requires bonds to be held at fair value and hence, to prevent an equity mis-match, the Group has chosen to move to a more active liability valuation basis for its insurance liabilities within the Netherlands.
As a result of this change, gross liabilities increased by 41 million and 213 million at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 respectively.
Having applied an active basis for valuing liabilities on a traditional gross and individual savings business, the amounts representing undistributed gains on investments backing these products which were previously booked to the fund for future appropriations under UK GAAP of 34 million at 1 January 2004 and 161 million at 31 December 2004 have been released to equity.
e Non-participating investment contracts and other sundry items The liability for those contracts classied as non-participating investment contracts is valued in accordance with IAS 39.
The majority of the Groups contracts classied as non-participating investment contracts are unit-linked contracts and have been valued at fair value.
For unit-linked contracts, the fair value liability is deemed to equal the current unit fund value, plus positive non-unit reserves if required on a fair value basis.
This replaces the reserve held under UK GAAP which equals the unit fund value plus any positive or negative non-unit reserves determined on the local valuation basis, and which differs from that required on a fair value basis.
In addition to the change in liability valuation, the accounting for deferred acquisition costs has been revised in accordance with IAS 18.
This restricts the types of acquisition costs that can be deferred, leading to a reduction in deferred acquisition costs as compared to UK GAAP.
The net impact on shareholders funds of the above changes and of other sundry items is a reduction of 67 million at 1 January 2004 and of 136 million at 31 December 2004.
In addition to the above, IFRS now requires that any front end fees received on non-participating investment contracts are included within an explicit deferred income reserve within creditors.
Under UK GAAP, any deferred acquisition cost asset created would have been net of these fees.
This has led to increases in Other assets and Other liabilities of 100 million and 114 million at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 respectively.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 100 Financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards continued 3 Employee benets a Pensions Under the Groups UK GAAP pension policy, as set out in Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24, Accounting for Pension Costs SSAP 24, the cost of providing pension benets is expensed using actuarial valuation methods which give a substantially even charge over the expected service lives of employees, and results in either a prepayment or an accrual to the extent that this charge does not equate to the cash contributions made into the schemes.
Under IAS 19, Employee Benets, the projected benefit obligation is matched against the fair value of the underlying assets and other unrecognised actuarial gains and losses in determining the pension expense for the year.
Any pension asset or obligation must be recorded in the balance sheet.
Aviva has not applied the corridor approach to valuing pension deficits.
This change in accounting has resulted in the removal of the Groups SSAP 24 balances, a net debtor of 251 million after allowing for deferred tax, at 1 January 2004 31 December 2004: 279 million and the recognition of a deficit of 583 million 31 December 2004: 630 million, net of deferred tax, valued in accordance with IAS 19.
This gives an overall impact on shareholders funds of 834 million at 1 January 2004 and 909 million at 31 December 2004.
The Group has assumed that substantially all of the pension deficit will fall to be borne by the shareholders.
This is particularly relevant to the UK pension scheme deficit, which forms the majority of the deficit recognised by the Group.
Costs, including pension costs, are charged to the UK Life companies and with-profit funds on the basis of a pre-determined Management Services Agreement MSA.
As reported at the time of the conversion to EEV, where similar assumptions have been made in connection with deficit funding, under the MSA, NU Life Services Limited can renegotiate the terms relating to the recharging of the costs to the UK with-profit fund in 2008, subject to regulatory approval.
In evaluating the impact on IFRS, Aviva has not sought to pre-empt the outcome of this renegotiation.
Any changes to the recharges in respect of the pension deficit will be credited to equity in the period agreement is obtained.
In some countries, the pension schemes have invested in the Groups long-term business funds.
IAS 19 requires the liquidity of the schemes assets to be considered and, if these are deemed non-transferable, the presentation of the total obligation to the schemes must include these amounts.
Accordingly, insurance liabilities have been reduced by 715 million at 1 January 2004 813 million at 31 December 2004 and provisions increased by the same amounts, to reect this disclosure.
There is no impact on equity or income arising from this presentation.
There are a number of adjustments impacting the Groups Provisions line.
However, the most significant adjustment relates to the recognition of the pension obligations as shown in the table below: 1 January 31 December 2004 2004 m m Provisions as stated under UK GAAP 336 340 Less: SSAP 24 pension obligation 78 63 deficit in the staff pension schemes 838 893 Other obligations to staff pension schemes insurance policies issued by Group companies 715 813 Total IAS 19 obligations to staff pension schemes 1,553 1,706 Adjustments to other provisions arising under IFRS 111 142 Provisions as stated under IFRS 1,922 2,125 b Equity compensation plans Under UK GAAP, the costs of awards to employees under equity compensation plans, other than the Save As You Earn plans, are recognised immediately if they are not conditional on performance criteria.
If the award is conditional upon future performance criteria, the cost is recognised over the period to which the employees service relates.
The minimum cost for the award is the difference between the fair value of the shares at the date of grant less any contribution required from employee or exercise price.
The cost is based on a reasonable expectation of the extent that the performance criteria will be met.
Any subsequent changes in that expectation are reected in the income statement as necessary.
Under IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, compensation costs for equity compensation plans that were granted after 7 November 2002, but had not yet vested at 1 January 2005, are determined based on the fair value of the share-based compensation at grant date, which is recognised in the income statement over the period of the expected life of the share-based instrument.
This change in accounting has not resulted in any material changes to the balance sheets at 1 January 2004 or 31 December 2004.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 101 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards continued 4 Goodwill and intangibles Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising before 1 January 1998 was eliminated against shareholders funds and was not subsequently reinstated.
Goodwill previously written off to shareholders funds is taken back through the profit and loss account when calculating the profit or loss in the event of any subsequent disposal of the underlying investment.
Under UK GAAP for acquisitions subsequent to 1997, goodwill arising on acquisition is carried on the balance sheet and amortised in the consolidated profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, not exceeding 20 years.
Under IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, goodwill is no longer amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually.
Any goodwill previously amortised prior to the date of transition 1 January 2004 or, for goodwill arising before 1 January 1998, eliminated against shareholders funds has not been reinstated.
Amortisation charged in 2004 under UK GAAP is not charged to profit under IFRS to the extent that it does not relate to an impairment, and hence shareholders funds increase upon conversion to IFRS.
In addition, negative goodwill of 40 million at 1 January 2004 and 37 million at 31 December 2004, previously recognised under UK GAAP, is included directly in retained earnings.
IFRS 3, Business combinations, requires that intangible assets such as customer lists, which can be separately identied and valued, must be recognised separately in the balance sheet.
The Group has applied IFRS 3 to acquisitions since 1 January 2004, which has resulted in 65 million of goodwill being reclassied as intangibles upon conversion to IFRS.
5 Dividend recognition Under UK GAAP, dividends are accrued in the period to which they relate, regardless of when they are declared and approved.
Under IAS 10, Events after the Balance Sheet Date, shareholders dividends are accrued only when declared and appropriately approved.
This has increased shareholders funds by 344 million at 1 January 2004 and 364 million at 31 December 2004.
6 Deferred tax Under UK GAAP, provision is made for deferred tax assets and liabilities, using the liability method, arising from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in a tax computation.
No provision is made for tax that might arise on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries unless a binding arrangement for distribution exists.
Deferred tax is recognised as a liability or asset if the transactions or events that give the entity an obligation to pay more tax in future or a right to pay less tax in future have occurred by the balance sheet date.
The Group policy is to discount its deferred tax balances.
Under IAS 12, Income tax, deferred tax is provided under the liability method for all relevant temporary differences, being the difference between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its value for tax purposes.
IAS 12 does not require all temporary differences to be provided for.
In particular, the Group does not provide for deferred tax on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of the distribution and the temporary difference created is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses and other deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be utilised against the unused tax losses and credits.
Discounting is prohibited under IAS 12.
The changes to deferred tax arise from the removal of discounting, changes to the valuation of the Groups assets and liabilities under IFRS and presentational changes to disclosure of tax assets and liabilities.
The main net increases in deferred tax that reduce shareholders funds are: 1 January 31 December 2004 2004 m m Reversal of discounting the total discounting applied to UK GAAP deferred tax liabilities at 1 January 2004 was 151 million 31 December 2004: 277 million, of which 110 million 31 December 2004: 215 million relates to non-life and shareholders interests 110 215 Deferred tax impact of the removal of the equalisation provision 108 117 Deferred tax impact of other changes to technical provisions, valuation of investments and other sundry adjustments 133 10 Net decrease to shareholders funds 351 322 Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 102 Financial statements continued Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards continued 7 Borrowings and cash IFRS requires a number of presentational changes to borrowings and cash.
The most significant change is that the linked presentation can no longer be adopted for the Groups borrowing securitised on certain of its mortgage portfolios.
This increases borrowings and investments by 3,143 million at 1 January 2004 and 5,110 million at 31 December 2004.
The equity impact of 37 million at 1 January 2004 and 26 million at 31 December 2004 relates to the application of the fair value option to the mortgages of the UK equity release business, the loan notes which are securitised upon them and backing derivatives, which more appropriately reects the commercial substance of this business.
This has increased borrowings by 90 million at 1 January 2004 and 97 million at 31 December 2004.
Additionally, 3,307 million of the Groups investments at 1 January 2004 31 December 2004: 8,792 million meet the denition of cash equivalents and so have been reclassied to this heading in the consolidated balance sheets.
8 FRS 27 Life Assurance In December 2004, the UKs Accounting Standards Board ASB issued Financial Reporting Standard 27, Life Assurance FRS 27.
In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding MoU signed by the Group along with other major insurance companies, the Association of British Insurers ABI and the ASB, the Group has adopted FRS 27 in its 2004 IFRS balance sheet.
FRS 27 requires insurance companies to measure their liabilities on with-profit business, on a realistic basis ie the FSAs denition of a realistic valuation.
The use of the realistic basis to measure liabilities for with-profit business does not impact reported profits, as an offsetting adjustment is made to the unallocated divisible surplus.
9 Other items The other changes that arise as a result of the transition to IFRS are principally reclassications and presentational changes.
The total effect of the other changes to shareholders funds is 71 million at 1 January 2004 and 77 million at 31 December 2004. i Assets held to cover linked liabilities of 40,665 million at 1 January 2004 and 51,144 million at 31 December 2004 are no longer disclosed in a single line but have been reported in the various asset classications.
Of this amount, assets of 3,343 million at 1 January 2004 and 4,965 million at 31 December 2004 have been netted off technical liabilities, reducing the gross assets and investment contract liabilities of the Group.
There is no impact on profit or shareholders funds as a result of this change.
ii The assets and liabilities of the banking business are no longer disclosed entirely in other debtors and other creditors but have been reported in the appropriate balance sheet classications.
iii Owner-occupied properties have been reclassied from investment property to property and equipment.
We continue to hold these properties at fair value.
iv Mutual funds have been consolidated where these vehicles meet the denition of a subsidiary.
This has resulted in an increase in gross assets of 1,606 million at 1 January 2004 and 2,247 million at 31 December 2004, representing the part of the funds owned by third parties.
This third party interest is recorded in the line net assets attributable to unitholders within liabilities.
The consolidation of mutual funds has no impact on shareholders funds or profit after tax.

Under UK GAAP, certain of the Groups bonds were held at amortised cost.
This change in valuation of debt securities resulted in a 2,459 million increase in the valuation of securities at 31 December 2004.
Most of this change was offset by corresponding movements in the unallocated divisible surplus and technical liabilities.
However, there was a residual uplift which resulted in a positive increase in the Groups shareholders funds, and the year-on-year movement in respect of those investments classied as at fair value through profit and loss account is reported as an increased profit in the 2004 income statement.
In addition, changes to investment accounting have resulted in 67 million of investment gains being reclassied from short-term uctuations to the life operating profit.
2 Insurance changes Insurance changes consist of: The removal of the claims equalisation provision, improving profit before tax by 23 million but with no impact on operating profit: The revaluation of liabilities and deferred acquisition costs on those contracts classied as non-participating investment contracts, reducing operating profit by 91 million: The revaluation of certain life reinsurance treaties, increasing operating profit by 14 million: Other sundry changes to our general insurance business reserves, increasing operating profit in 2004 by 5 million.
Of these changes, the most significant impact occurs on our UK Life business, where profit falls by 90 million as a result of the adoption of IAS 39.
On the basis of 2004 gross written premiums, 44% of our total life business within the UK is classied as non-participating investment contracts and includes unit-linked bonds and unit-linked pension contracts.
IAS 39 reduces the level of deferred acquisition costs that can be recognised, as well as requiring the removal from technical provisions of positive or negative non-unit reserves determined on the local valuation basis held over and above the unit fund value.
The effect of these changes is that the profits on a non-participating investment contract will arise later in the contract term under IFRS than under UK GAAP.
Aviva plc 2005 Financial statements 105 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards continued The overall impact on annual profits arising from this accounting change is dependent upon levels of new business, product mixes, the ageing prole of the existing in-force business and reserving policies.
Additional new business strain under IFRS would be expected to be mitigated by the emergence of higher IFRS basis profits of the in-force book of business.
Until mid-2003, unit-linked bond business sold by Norwich Union in the UK contained a guaranteed minimum death benefit, and hence contained significant insurance risk, and accordingly, as permitted by IFRS Phase 1, the UK GAAP basis profit prole has been retained.
After mid-2003, this benefit was removed and business written since this time has been classied as non-participating investment business.
The existing in-force business is therefore small and profits are insufficient to offset the new business strain.
A significant conversion effect on profit therefore arises.
This reduction in profit is no more than a timing adjustment.
Avivas main value measure remains European embedded value and the profit arising on this basis is unaffected by this technical accounting change.
3 Employee benets The overall impact of adopting IAS 19, Employee benets, and IFRS 2, Share based compensation, has been to increase costs by 48 million in 2004.
This partly reects the fact that IAS 19 has used a more current actuarial valuation to measure the ongoing pension service cost.
The charge under UK GAAP was based on the SSAP 24 valuation which, as disclosed in the 2004 Annual Report and Accounts, was last updated for financial reporting purposes in April 2002.
4 Goodwill Goodwill is no longer amortised under IFRS but is subject to annual impairment review.
Impairment charges of 41 million were incurred in 2004, relating to sundry small overseas businesses, which had been fully reected within the UK GAAP amortisation charge of 120 million.
No additional impairment arose as a result of the transition to IFRS.
A further 169 million credit arises to profit before tax, as goodwill previously charged directly to reserves was deducted from profit upon disposal of subsidiaries under UK GAAP.
Under IFRS no such deduction is required.
This change has no impact on operating profit or shareholders funds.
5 Policyholder tax Operating profit before tax has fallen relative to the UK GAAP result by 93 million as a result of a change in the allocation of the tax charged to the life funds between policyholders and shareholders.
This presentational change has no impact on operating profit after tax or the tax suffered by the life funds but merely represents how the tax charge is presented in the financial statements.
The increase in tax costs charged to operating profit arises principally in the UK, but has been partly offset by a change in allocation in the Netherlands, where all tax is now deemed to be shareholder tax.
It is a feature of the UK tax regime that the tax attributable to life business operations is a single charge in respect of policyholder income and shareholder profits.
Under UK GAAP, the difficulty of allocating this charge between policyholders and shareholders is generally acknowledged and hence, under UK GAAP, the total tax charge is deducted from life operating profit in the long-term technical account, the net result of which is then grossed up at the effective shareholder tax rate.
Traditionally, Aviva has grossed up at 30% which represents its view of the long-term effective rate.
We remain of the view that this will be the rate suffered by shareholders over the longer term.
Under IFRS, all taxation must be reported within the taxation line.
The profit before this total tax would present a misleading picture of the Groups profit as i much of the policyholder tax is in the with-profits funds where the unallocated divisible surplus is adjusted on a net of tax basis: ii the cost of policyholder tax is priced into the relevant products: and iii the level of tax will vary on an annual basis in line with the investment return on assets backing the long-term funds.
The UK industry has therefore agreed that it is appropriate to adopt an income statement presentation which depicts profit before tax attributable to the shareholders.
This requires an allocation of the total tax charge between policyholders and shareholders, with the policyholder charge being offset against operating profit.
There is no universal view on how this allocation should be performed.
Aviva has taken the view that the IFRS conceptual framework does not permit companies to use notional allocation or gross-up methods.
Instead, the allocation to policyholder tax should reect the actual tax payable at policyholder rates, including deferred tax.
Aviva has therefore developed a conceptual methodology to achieve this consistently year-on-year.
In 2004, the level of tax attributed to the shareholders was reduced by the following arrangement.
The 1.5 billion of capital injected into the life funds on the demutualisation of Norwich Union in 1997 had the effect that future distributions up to that amount by Norwich Union Life and Pensions are treated as already having suffered some shareholder tax.
In 2004, a substantial proportion of the companys shareholders surplus was sheltered by this arrangement and this has the impact of lowering the actual tax paid at shareholder rates.
This is a genuine benefit to shareholders and resulted in higher profit after tax.
This tax benefit has a nite capacity and will at some point be exhausted, such that over the long-term there will be an increase in shareholder tax rates back towards 30%.
The use of this capacity is dependent on the level of distributions made by Norwich Union Life & Pensions.
The impact of this is that operating profit before tax falls relative to the UK GAAP result, as the actual shareholder rate suffered in the UK in 2004 was lower than 30%.
It should be noted that, from an EEV perspective, an asset representing this tax benefit is already established and so 30% remains as an appropriate shareholder tax rate for this business.
