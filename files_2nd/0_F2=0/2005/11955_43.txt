On 1 July 2005 options over 2,069,047 ordinary shares of 25p were granted pursuant to the 1998 Pendragon Sharesave Scheme at an exercise price of 302p per share.
The grants of share options under the 1999 Schemes prescribed an earnings per share performance criterion.
It is a pre condition to the exercise of grants made under the 1999 Schemes that the growth in the company's earnings per share over the prescribed three year period must exceed by at least 3 per cent per annum compound the annual rate of inflation as shown by the RPI Index.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised in the year was 314.8 pence 2004 : 252.2 pence.
The vesting conditions attaching to the 1999 Pendragon Sharesave schemes are that the option holder must be employed by the group on the date of exercise.
67 27 Employee benefits continued All options are settled by physical delivery of shares.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the weighted average fair value of the options at the date of grant is 30 pence 2004: 22 pence.
The Black-Scholes model is run for each individual share option scheme and employee share save schemes.
The inputs into the model for options granted in the year are as follows: 2005 2004 Weighted average share price pence 302.0 293.0 Weighted average exercise price pence 302.0 301.0 Expected volatility % 31.7 30.9 Expected life years 4.1 5.0 Risk free rate % 4.0 4.8 Expected dividend yield % 5.1 5.5 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the group's share price over the corresponding historical period.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of exercise restrictions and team member turnover.
The group recognised total expense of 0.4m 2004 : 0.3m related to equity-settled share based payment transactions.
Pension obligations Pendragon PLC operates six pension schemes, three of which have defined contribution sections in addition to defined benefit sections.
The asset values shown do not include those of the defined contribution sections.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in excess of a 'corridor' which is equal to 10% of the greater of the value of the assets and liabilities at the beginning of the year in question.
The excess actuarial gains and losses are spread over the average remaining service lives of employees.
Actuarial gains and losses consist of differences between actual and expected returns on scheme assets during the year, experience losses on scheme liabilites and the impact of any changes in assumptions.
