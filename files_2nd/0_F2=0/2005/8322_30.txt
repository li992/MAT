Benefits granted have been developed to reflect local practice and may be provided through defined benefit or defined contribution schemes.
The main defined benefit plans are in the UK and Australia: UK: The majority of pensions for UK employees are funded through the industry-wide scheme, the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme ESPS, which is a defined benefit scheme with assets invested in separate trustee administered funds.
The ESPS is divided into sections, and the International Power Group of the ESPS was opened to members on 1 April 2002 and employees past service rights were transferred into the Group later that year.
The majority of employees taken on in First Hydro, as part of the acquisition of the EME portfolio, are members of another section of the ESPS, the Edison Mission Energy Group.
The liabilities and costs shown in the disclosures for the UK schemes are based on the most recent actuarial valuations at 31 March 2004.
The results of these valuations have been updated to 31 December 2005 by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19.
AUSTRALIA: Employees at Hazelwood and Loy Yang B participate in a standard Australian superannuation fund called Equipsuper.
This plan provides benefits primarily for employees in the electricity, gas and water industry, and was developed from the scheme sponsored by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria.
Employees at Synergen participate in the Electricity Industry Superannuation Scheme.
The liabilities and costs shown in the disclosures for the Australian schemes are based on the most recent actuarial valuations at 30 June 2005.
The Group operates a number of other defined benefit schemes for employees of its businesses in other countries.
Full actuarial valuations of these schemes have been carried out within the last three years and results have been updated to 31 December 2005 by independent qualified actuaries.
The liabilities and costs for IAS 19 were determined using the projected unit credit method.
The Group has decided to recognise gains and losses through the income statement over the expected working lifetime of active employees to the extent that gains or losses are in excess of the corridor 10% of the greater of the defined benefit obligation and the plan assets.
The charge for 2005 in respect of defined contribution plans was 3 million 2004: 1 million.
The Group used the following assumptions to calculate the scheme liabilities under IAS 19: 31 December 2005 31 December 2004 31 December 2003 Financial assumptions UK Australia UK Australia UK Australia %% %% % % Discount rate 4.7 4.6 5.3 4.5 5.4 7.5 Rate of increase in salaries 4.4 4.0 4.4 4.0 4.3 4.0 Inflation rate 2.9 3.0 2.9 3.0 2.8 3.0 Increase to deferred benefits during deferment 2.9 n a 3.0 n a 2.9 n a Increases to pensions payments 2.9 n a 2.9 n a 2.9 n a Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 93 The amount recorded in the income statement in relation to the defined benefit pension plans for the year ended 31 December 2005 was as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2005 2004 m m Amounts charged to profit from operations Current service cost 9 5 Expected return on schemes assets 11 7 Interest on schemes liabilities 9 6 Curtailment cost 1 Total operating charge 7 5 The assets in the schemes and expected rates of return weighted averages were: 31 December 2005 31 December 2004 31 December 2003 UK Australia UK Australia UK Australia Long-term rate of return expected: %% %% %% Equities 7.1 7.5 7.5 7.3 7.8 7.6 Bonds 4.4 5.0 4.9 4.8 5.1 4.8 Other 6.0 5.9 6.0 5.5 6.6 6.1 Total long-term rate of return expected 6.6 6.7 7.0 6.5 7.4 6.7 The expected rates of return reflect the Groups best estimate of the investment returns that will be earned on each asset class.
These returns are based on advice provided by independent qualified actuaries.
