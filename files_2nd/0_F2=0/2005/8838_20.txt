138,003 LTRP options were granted during the year, 2,885 LTRP options were exercised during the year and 59,428 LTRP options lapsed during the year.
Long Term Incentive Scheme The Group introduced a Long Term Incentive Scheme 'LTIS' during the year.
Under this Scheme, the executive directors but not the Chairman and other key senior executives are awarded shares dependent upon the achievement of performance targets established by the Remuneration Committee.
The performance measures for the first cycle are operating profit, return on capital employed and growth in the company's share price.
The awards are in the form of restricted shares and are deferred for two years from the award date.
On the assumption that 2005 actual performance levels are repeated in each of the next two years, 6,378,346 shares are potentially issuable under the scheme.
Further details of the LTIS are provided in the Directors' Remuneration Report.

As permitted under IFRS, the Group has used proportional consolidation to consolidate its joint ventures.
Under this method, the Group includes its share of each joint venture's income, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows on a line by line basis in the consolidated financial statements.
The Group has presented the proportional consolidation of the joint ventures as a separate column in the UK GAAP to IFRS reconciliations.
Shareholders' equity is not impacted by the adoption of proportional consolidation.
b Share based charges Under UK GAAP, charges for share based payments are based on the intrinsic value of share options awarded at the grant date.
Under IFRS, the charge is based on the fair value of the share options awarded at the grant date.
The fair value is calculated using option pricing models and applies to all options granted after 7 November 2002 and not vested at 1 January 2005.
The adjustment for the year ended 31 December 2004 is US$1.7m.
c Other intangible assets Purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised on acquisition and amortised over their useful life.
On the acquisition of a business, any intangible asset that may exist separately from goodwill and that meets the recognition criteria under IFRS should be recognised and amortised over its useful economic life.
Under IFRS, the recognition criteria for intangible assets may result in the recognition of more intangible assets than under UK GAAP.
On transition to IFRS, US$2.7m of intangible assets have been recognised on acquisitions made in 2004.
These intangible assets had a useful economic life of less than one year and as a result were fully amortised during 2004.
A charge of US$2.7m was booked for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Additionally, computer software, which was previously included in property plant and equipment under UK GAAP, has been reclassified under other intangible assets as required by IFRS.
US$2.1m was reclassified in the opening balance sheet note that this adjustment was not made in the opening balance sheet provided with the interim accounts.
US$6.3m was reclassified in the balance sheet at 31 December 2004.
Amortisation on this software is added back to operating profit for the calculation of EBITA.
There is no impact on EBITDA as the amortisation was previously treated as depreciation.
Software amortisation for the year to December 2004 was US$2.0m.
d Goodwill Under UK GAAP, goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life.
Under IFRS 3, goodwill is not amortised but subject to an annual impairment review.
Goodwill amortisation of US$16.9m booked in 2004 under UK GAAP has been reversed and goodwill is carried at 1 January 2004 levels.
e Tax Under UK GAAP, the provision for deferred tax is based on a timing difference approach, whereas under IFRS a temporary difference approach is used.
Consequently, accounting under IFRS may result in the provision of additional deferred tax.
Due to the reversal of the goodwill amortisation charge for 2004 mentioned at d above, the book value of goodwill has increased.
There has been no change in the underyling tax basis of the goodwill in those countries where amortisation is tax deductible and therefore additional deferred tax arises on the increase in the temporary difference.
Additional deferred tax of US$1.9m has been provided for the year ended December 2004.
John Wood Group PLC 103 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2005 36 Reconciliation of net assets and profit under UK GAAP to IFRS continued f Deferred tax relating to retirement benefit liabilities Under UK GAAP, the deferred tax assets in respect of retirement benefit liabilities are netted against the liabilities.
Under IFRS the deferred tax relating to retirement benefit liabilities is split out and shown separately on the face of the balance sheet.
The deferred tax asset at 1 January 2004 amounted to US$8.2m and at 31 December 2004 US$10.2m.
g Dividends Under UK GAAP, proposed dividends are recognised at the balance sheet date.
IFRS requires that dividends should not be recognised as a liability or charged to equity until they have been declared.
As a result, the dividends accrued at 31 December 2003 US$10.4m and 31 December 2004 US$11.1m under UK GAAP have been reversed and only dividends paid in the year recognised in the financial statements.
h Cash flow statement The Group cash flow statement has been prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The changes to the Group's cash flows that were previously presented under UK GAAP are mainly presentational although the proportional consolidation of joint ventures results in the Group's share of its joint venture cash flows being included on a line by line basis.
"Under IFRS, the cash flow statement presents ""cash and cash equivalents"" which includes short-term deposits."
In the UK GAAP cash flow statement the movement in short-term deposits was shown separately from the movement in cash.

Sir Ian Wood, Director Allister G Langlands, Director 108 John Wood Group PLC Notes to the Company financial statements for the year to 31 December 2005 Accounting policies The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom.
A summary of the principal accounting policies which have been consistently applied, is set out below.
Changes in accounting policies The Company has adopted FRS 20, Share-based payment, FRS 21, Events after the balance sheet date, FRS 23, The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, FRS 25, Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation, FRS 26, Financial instruments: Measurement, and FRS 28, Corresponding amounts, in these financial statements.
The adoption of each of these standards represents a change in accounting policy and comparative figures have been restated accordingly except where the exemption to restate comparatives has been taken in accordance with FRS 25 and FRS 26.
Details of the effect of the prior year adjustments are given in note 8.
Reporting currency The Companys transactions are primarily US dollar denominated and the principal functional currency is the US dollar.
The following sterling to US dollar exchange rates have been used in the preparation of these accounts:- Average rate Closing rate 1 US$ 1 US$ Year ended 31 December 2004 1.8310 1.9199 Year ended 31 December 2005 1.8170 1.7168 Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are included in the balance sheet of the Company at cost less any provision for impairment.
Impairment The Company performs impairment reviews in respect of fixed asset investments whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount of an asset, which is the higher of the assets net realisable value and its value in use, is less than its carrying amount.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date, with the following exceptions:- provision is made for gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets only where, at the balance sheet date, there is a commitment to dispose of the replacement assets.
provision is made for the tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been declared or there is a binding commitment.
on the basis of all available evidence deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
John Wood Group PLC 109 Notes to the Company financial statements for the year to 31 December 2005 Accounting policies Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction or, where forward contracts have been arranged, at the contractual rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet dates or at a contractual rate if applicable and any exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
The directors consider it appropriate to record sterling denominated equity share capital in the accounts of John Wood Group PLC at the exchange rate ruling on the date it was raised.
Financial instruments The Company accounting policy for financial instruments is consistent with the Group accounting policy as presented in the notes to the Group financial statements with the exception of the policy on net investment hedges which does not apply to the Company.
The Companys financial risk management policy is consistent with the Groups financial risk management policy outlined in note 18 to the Group financial statements.
Operating leases As lessee Payments made under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Use of estimates The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Employee share ownership trusts The Company is deemed to have control of the assets, liabilities, income and costs of its employee share ownership trusts ESOP trusts.
They have therefore been included in the financial statements of the Company.
Under UITF 38 the cost of shares held by the ESOP trusts is deducted from shareholders funds.
Share based charges The Company has a number of share schemes as detailed in the Group accounting policies and notes 21 and 22 to the Group financial statements.
Details relating to the calculation of share based charges are provided in note 21 to the Group financial statements.
In respect of the Company, the charge is shown as an increase in the Companys investments, as the employees to which the charge relates are employed by subsidiary companies.
