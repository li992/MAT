EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Pension arrangements The Group operates various funded pension schemes which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
The most signi cant funds are described below.
United Kingdom The Group operates a pension scheme the Millennium & Copthorne Pension Plan for its UK employees which was set up in 1993.
The scheme is a funded fide ned bene t arrangement with different categories of membership.
The Trustees of the Plan have appointed The Frank Russell Company and Legal and General Investment Management Limited as the investment managers of the Plan.
The assets of the Plan are held separately from those of the Group.
Scheme costs are charged so as to spread the cost of providing the scheme bene ts over the average remaining service lives of the employees concerned.
The contributions required are determined by a quali ed actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a quali ed independent actuary as at 6 April 2005 and this has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2005.
The contributions of the Group were 20.6% of pensionable salary 2004: 20.6%.
The contributions of employees were from 3% to 5% 2004: 3% to 5% of pensionable salary.
As the fide ned bene t section is closed to new entrants, the current service cost, as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.
The assumptions which have the most signi cant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to mortality, the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
The expected average remaining working lifetime of the members was calculated to be 8 years.
Korea The Group operates a fide ned bene t pension plan for its employees.
The contributions required are determined by an external quali ed actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2005.
The contributions of the Group were 13% 2004: 11.7% of the employees earnings.
The assumptions which have the most signi cant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and rate of increase in salaries.
