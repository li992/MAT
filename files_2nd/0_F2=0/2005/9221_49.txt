Defined benefit plans The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The major schemes are defined benefit funds, with assets held separately from those of the Group.
Although the Group is responsible for the operation of these arrangements, professional advisors are appointed to run them.
The most significant pension scheme is the Hilton Group Pension Plan, which is a final-salary pension plan for UK employees.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Hilton Group Pension Plan was carried out with an effective date of 1 July 2005.
The latest actuarial valuations of the other principal funded defined benefit schemes were carried out in 2005.
The Group has no significant exposure to any other retirement obligations.
The results of the actuarial valuations were updated to the accounting date by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with IAS 19.
The value of the defined benefit obligation and current service cost has been measured using the projected unit credit method, as required by IAS 19.
Some of the Groups schemes are closed to new members and using this method will, in isolation, lead to the current service cost for these schemes increasing as their members approach retirement.
As part of the agreement for the sale of Hilton International, HHC have committed to fund at least 50% of the IAS 19 deficit of the Hilton Group Pension Plan.
Hilton International will make this payment after completion.
Following completion a mirror scheme will be set up for the employees of the Hotel business who are active members at the date of completion and other beneficiaries of the Plan.
HHC will become the principal employer of the mirror scheme.
The assets and liabilities of the Plan which are attributable to the hotels business will be transferred to the mirror scheme including a proportionate share of those liabilities associated with transferring employees who are directly employed by Hilton Group plc, which shall include a proportionate share of deferred pensioner and pensioner members.
The mirror scheme will also receive a transfer of assets and liabilities in respect of 50% of the orphans and unallocated members of the Plan.
