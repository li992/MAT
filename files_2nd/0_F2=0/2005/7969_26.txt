Inchcape plc Annual report and accounts 2005 103 Notes to the accounts As at 31 December 2005 1 Prior year adjustment and impact of new standards The adoption of FRS 21 has resulted in an increase in shareholders funds of 20.3m at 1 January 2004 due to the reversal of the final dividend proposed at 31 December 2003.
Under the previous standard, SSAP 17 Post Balance Sheet Events, proposed dividends were recognised as an adjusting post balance sheet event.
Under FRS 21 a dividend is only recognised when the shareholders right to receive the payment is established, which in the case of the final dividend is not until they have been approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
FRS 20 requires that equity settled share-based payment transactions should be recognised at their fair value at the date of grant and in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the vesting period based on an estimate of the number of shares.
The corresponding entry is made to shareholders funds and the adoption of FRS 20 has resulted in no change in shareholders funds other than a decrease of 0.3m at 1 January 2004, reflecting the tax impact of the change in accounting policy.
