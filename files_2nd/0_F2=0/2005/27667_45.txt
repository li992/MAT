As described in note 1 Accounting Policies, these vary significantly between geographies and are therefore discussed separately below.
Africa In the calculation of liabilities, provision has been made for: the best estimate of future experience, as described below: plus the compulsory margins as set out in the Actuarial Society of South Africa professional guidance notes: plus discretionary margins reflecting mainly the excess of capital charges over the compulsory investment margin of 0.25% for policies that are valued prospectively.
These discretionary margins cause capital charges to be included in operating profits as they are charged and ensure that profits are released appropriately over the term of each policy.
Other discretionary margins, mainly held to cover: mortality and investment return margins for Group Schemes funeral policies, due to the additional risk associated with this business, and to ensure that profit is released appropriately over the term of the policies: expense margins in the pricing basis for Employee Benefits with-profit annuities: profit margins on Employee Benefits Platinum and non-profit annuities to ensure that profit is released appropriately over the life policies: mortality margins on Individual Business life policies, accidental death supplementary benefits and disability supplementary benefits, due to uncertainty about future experience: interest margins on certain Individual Business non-profit annuities, due to the inability to fully match assets liabilities as a result of the limited availability of long-dated bonds: and interest margins on Employee Benefits PHI claims in payment due to the limited availability of CPI-linked bonds and long-dated bonds and the high rate of change in the portfolio high volume of new claimants and terminations.
Liabilities include provisions to meet financial options and guarantees, and make due allowance for potential lapses and surrenders, based on levels recently experienced.
Mortality and disability rates assumed are consistent with Old Mutuals recent experience, or expected future experience if this would result in a higher liability.
In particular, allowance has been made for the expected deterioration in assured lives experience due to HIV AIDS, and for the expected improvement in annuitant mortality.
The future gross investment returns by major asset categories and expense inflation excluding margins assumed for South Africa assurance business are as follows: At At 31 December 31 December 2005 2004 Fixed interest securities 8.0% Cash 6.0% Equities 11.5% Properties 9.5% Future expense inflation 5.0% 8.0% Investment return assumption was not split by asset class an aggregate gross investment return of 11.0% was assumed for 31 December 2004.
7% for Individual Business administered on old platforms and 6% for Group Schemes business.
For non-profit annuities, liabilities are determined by calculating the present value of projected future benefits and expenses, valued using current fixed-interest yield based on the bond yield curve at the valuation date.
Assumptions are based upon recent experience as analysed in the following investigations: Business Unit Type of investigation Period of investigation Individual business Flexi business mortality 2001 to 2002 Conventional business mortality 1999 to 2000 Annuitant mortality 2001 to 2002 Dread disease 2000 to 2002 Disability 2000 to 2002 Persistency 2003 Group schemes Mortality 2004 Persistency 2005 Employee benefits Annuitant mortality July 2000 to June 2003 Group assurance Ongoing for the purpose of setting scheme rates All Expenses Reviewed on an annual basis Old Mutual plc 134 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 22 INSURANCE CONTRACT PROVISIONS AND RELATED REINSURANCE continued There were some benefit improvements and various changes to valuation assumptions.
These largely offset each other, resulting in a net reduction in the value of insurance contract provisions of 3 million as at 31 December 2005, with a corresponding increase in net profit of the same amount.
The main changes were as follows: Benefit improvements: A reserve of 66 million has been established for the effect of the minimum paid-up and surrender value bases that were announced in the Statement of Intent by the Long-term Insurance Industry and the Minister of Finance on 12 December 2005.
The provision for the effect of the SA Life Industry SA Life Statement of Intent on minimum surrender and paid-up values has been calculated assuming future surrender and paid-up sales will be similar to recent experience.
Provision has been made for the cover on certain Group Schemes funeral plans to be increased or extended, to improve value for money, leading to an increase in liabilities of 20 million.
Assumption changes: The change in the expense inflation assumptions reduced the value of liabilities by 58 million.
The provision for future maintenance expenses for certain products was reduced based on the results of the most recent expense investigation, reducing the value of liabilities by 24 million.
Greenlight decrement assumption changes resulted in a reduction in liabilities of 17 million.
Group Schemes reviewable funeral plans are now valued for the full contract term.
This, together with a reduction in assumed future premium increases for other funeral plans led to a reduction in the value of liabilities of 14 million.
Shareholder-funded investment guarantee reserves were increased by 14 million due to modelling changes.
The change in the investment return valuation assumptions has resulted in an increase in the value of liabilities of 10 million.
North America Insurance contract provisions and DAC balances for traditional insurance products with fixed premiums and benefits measured according to FAS 60 under US GAAP are calculated using mortality, lapse, expense and discount assumptions as at inception of the contract.
These assumptions are determined based on managements best estimate, reflecting actual and expected experience, and also include provision for adverse deviation.
The assumptions are locked in as of the date of issue, and are revised only where liability adequacy testing based on current best estimate assumptions results in loss recognition.
For insurance products with flexible premiums or benefits measured according to FAS 97 under US GAAP, the account value is held as the base insurance contract provision, and the assumptions below are therefore not applicable.
DAC balances, and additional reserves held for items including lapse guarantees, persistency bonuses and gains followed by losses, utilise best estimate assumptions as of the valuation date.
Mortality rates vary by gender and issue age: lapse rates vary by issue age and duration.
Reserves for life contingent payout annuities are accumulated using the effective interest rate, which is the rate that discounts future liability cash flows back to the gross premium less transaction costs.
All other FAS 60 products use a discount rate based on best estimate of future yields at policy inception.
Best estimate assumptions as of December 2005 reflect recent experience as analysed in the following investigations: Assumption Period of investigation Mortality rates assurance 1994 to 2005 Mortality rates annuities 2003 Lapse rates 2003 and 2005 Expenses 2005 At 31 December 2005, there was no change to assumptions as a result of the liability adequacy testing performed.
