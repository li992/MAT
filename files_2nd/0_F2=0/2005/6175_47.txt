Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that fully reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to MLT.
The growth rates are based on independent local industry growth forecasts.
MLT prepares cash flow forecasts for the next five years derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows from MLT is 7%.
