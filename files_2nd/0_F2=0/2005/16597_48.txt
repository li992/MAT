Financial instruments The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are commodity price risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised overleaf.
VENTURE PRODUCTION PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 81 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Commodity price risk To manage commodity price risk and deliver stability to the investment programme the Groups policy is to allow hedging of commodity price exposure up to 50% of its oil and gas production in the UK.
In exceptional circumstances, and only with the prior approval of the Board, up to 75% of such production may be hedged.
Hedges have been put in place with a variety of providers.
Foreign currency risk In general, the Groups revenues in crude oil sales are denominated in US dollars while its gas sales revenues are denominated in pounds sterling.
Where possible, the Groups policy is to reduce significant exposures to movements in foreign currency exchange rates through hedging foreign currency exposure for up to 50% of forecast net US dollar revenues.
The Group hedge accounts for these forward contracts and thus changes in the forward contract fair values are initially booked to the cash flow reserve in equity and then reverse in the income statement over the term of the contracts.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings and convertible bonds.
Group policy permits fixing of interest rates on borrowings up to a maximum of 100 million.
The Group borrows at rates of interest, which are fixed in advance for periods of between one month and six months.
At 31 December 2005, approximately 86% 2004: 100% of the Groups borrowings were at floating rates.
Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and planned developments.
This includes a review of the Groups borrowing base annually.
Credit risk The Groups credit risk primarily relates to its trade receivables.
The Groups major customers are typically large companies which have strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and, generally does not require collateral from its customers.
