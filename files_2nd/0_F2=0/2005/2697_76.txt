The cost of providing shares awarded and expected to vest under employee share plans is accrued over the performance period of the plans.
During 2005, the Company received 38 million on the issue of shares in respect of the exercise of options awarded under various share option plans.
Employees paid 37 million to the Company for the issue of these shares and the balance of 1 million comprised contributions from an employee share trust funded by subsidiary undertakings.
The other reserve represents an unrealised gain following an internal reorganisation.
As this becomes distributable, a transfer is made to retained profits.
Prior year adjustment The prior year adjustment relates to the implementation of FRS 17, FRS 20 and FRS 21.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 23, FRS 25 and FRS 26 have been applied prospectively without the need for full restatement of comparatives.
The adoption of FRS 17 has resulted in the derecognition of the 2 million pension asset recorded on the 2004 opening balance sheet under SSAP 24.
As the Company accounts for defined benefit plans as if they were defined contribution schemes, there is no impact on the profit and loss account arising from the adoption of FRS 17 2004: nil.
The adoption of FRS 20 has resulted in an increase in staff costs of 4 million 2004: 6 million.
No restatement of opening reserves is required because there is a corresponding credit to reserves in 2004.
The adoption of FRS 21 has resulted in an increase in shareholders funds of 177 million at 3 January 2005 due to the write back of the dividend proposed at 2 January 2005.
Share based payments The Company recognised total expenses of 7 million 2004: 9 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.
Full details of the share option plans are included in the Directors Remuneration Report in the Group consolidated financial statements.
The BSRP is available to a group of senior executives including the Executive Directors.

Also during the period, matching awards were made over 380,922 shares 2004: 368,090.
The fair value of the shares under the plan is based on the market price of the Companys ordinary shares on the date of the award.
Where the awards do not attract dividends during the vesting period, the market price is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid during the expected life of the awards.
Awards made under this scheme are classified as equity settled.
The expense recognised in respect of these awards was 2 million 2004: 3 million.
Certain senior executives including the Executive Directors are granted a conditional award of shares under the LTIP.
The expense recognised in respect of these awards was 2 million 2004: 2 million.
