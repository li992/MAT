As a consequence of the exchange control arrangements in place in South Africa and other relevant African territories, dividends to shareholders on the branch registers in those countries or in the case of Namibia, the Namibian section of the principal register are settled through Dividend Access Trusts established for that purpose.
The directors have recommended a 2005 final dividend of 3.65p per share which, subject to being approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 10 May 2006, will be paid to shareholders on the register at the close of business on the record date for the dividend.
No provision has been recognised in respect of this dividend.
