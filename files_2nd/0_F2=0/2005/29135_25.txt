At 31 March 2005 the Company had surplus management expenses of 44 million 2004 38 million of which 880,000 was of a revenue nature which have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
This is because the Company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of the deductible expenses of that future period and, accordingly, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing surplus expenses.
