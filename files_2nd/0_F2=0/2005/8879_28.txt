Notes to the Company Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 35.
Significant Accounting Policies The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
As permitted by that Act, the separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Applicable Accounting Standards.
No profit and loss account is presented as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Of the Group profit for the year, 96,835,000 2004 - 35,524,000 is dealt with in the financial statements of the parent company.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain fixed assets.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed asset balances are shown at valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, excluding land, at varying rates calculated to write-off cost over the useful lives.
The principal rates employed are: Heritable and freehold property excluding land 2.5% on written down value Leasehold land and buildings equal annual instalments over lease term Other plant and machinery 15% on written down value 6.67%, 10%, 20%, 25% and 33% straight line basis Motor vehicles 25% straight line basis Investments Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
Listed investments are shown at current market valuation.
Upward revaluations are credited to the revaluation reserve.
Downward revaluations in excess of any previous upward revaluations are taken to the Profit and Loss Account.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value as follows: Cost incurred in bringing materials to their present location and condition comprises: a raw materials and goods for resale at purchase cost on a first-in first-out basis: and b work in progress at cost of direct materials, labour and certain overheads.
Net realisable value comprises selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Borrowings Interest-bearing loans and bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premia payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are charged to the Profit and Loss Account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Profit and Loss Account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which such assets can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Profit and Loss Account, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Share-based payments The Company issues equity settled share-based benefits to certain employees.
These share-based payments are measured at their fair value at the date of grant and the fair value of expected shares is expensed to the Profit and Loss Account on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes model, as amended to take account of the Directors best estimate of probable share vesting and exercise.
Dividends Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recorded as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved.
In the Companys financial statements, dividends receivable from subsidiaries are recognised as assets in the period in which the dividends are approved.
The policies described above relating to share-based payments and dividends represent a change in the policies previously applied.
Accordingly, the prior year balance sheet has been restated.
The effect of this is shown in note 45.
