FUTURE ENDOWMENT COMPLAINTS The operating exceptional charge of 10.0m is the estimated costs and redress payments in respect of endowment complaints that are anticipated to be received in the future as described more fully in notes 27 and 32.
Given its size, this charge has been treated as an operating exceptional item.
REGULATORY REVIEW OF STRUCTURED CAPITAL AT RISK PRODUCTS The operating exceptional charge of 2.8m is the estimated costs and redress payments arising from the reassessment of the past conclusions reached on complaints received in respect of sales of structured capital at risk products.
This reassessment forms part of a regulatory review which is described more fully in notes 27 and 32.
These costs have been treated as an operating exceptional charge given their size and because the majority of sales were made before Misys acquired the relevant member network.
FORMER NETWORK MEMBER REVIEW In the prior year an operating exceptional item of 8.0m was charged to the profit and loss account representing the estimated additional costs and redress payments associated with a regulatory review of one former network member of Sesame Limited formerly Kestrel Financial Management Limited.
During the year Sesame and the FSA have reached agreement on how this review 53 should proceed and this work is well advanced.
As a result the estimated additional costs, including an FSA fine of 0.3m, and redress payments associated with the review have been recalculated resulting in a credit of 3.9m in the current year.
There was a cash outflow of 0.2m 2004: nil in respect of the operating exceptional items in the year.
NON OPERATING EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS In the current year a non operating exceptional charge of 2.7m has been made in relation to the impairment of the assets of AssureWeb Limited which was disposed of on 7 July 2005.
There was no cash outflow in respect of this item in the year.
In the prior year a profit on the disposal and part disposal of operations of 0.4m was made relating to the disposal of the Misys Securities Trading Systems and certain parts of the Misys Asset Management Systems businesses and the part disposal of AssureWeb Limited.
The cash inflow on these items in the year was 0.2m 2004: 18.7m, net of expenses and cash disposed of with the businesses.

EXCEPTIONAL TAX CREDIT IN RESPECT OF PRIOR YEARS During the prior year there was a 14.6m tax credit arising on the resolution of certain issues that had been subject to overseas tax audits.
The tax credit reflected both the release of overseas current tax liabilities of 9.5m, and the establishment of 5.1m of deferred tax assets relating to future tax deductions.

The range of economic lives used for accounting purposes is in line with the asset lives typically used internationally by IT product companies for these types of acquisitions, which the Directors believe to be the most appropriate periods.
Goodwill capitalised on acquisitions totalled 4.2m in the year in respect of the current year acquisition, with 0.7m amortisation being charged in relation to this acquisition.
CURRENT YEAR ACQUISITION Within Banking, the Group acquired IDOM Consulting UK Limited on 14 August 2004 for a maximum consideration, including acquisition expenses, of 6.4m.
Consideration of 4.9m has been recognised, resulting in goodwill of 4.2m.
The consideration is payable in three instalments, and is conditional upon the Company achieving defined performance milestones by 31 May 2006.
At the balance sheet date it has not been possible to determine the full extent to which this consideration will become payable and thus only that consideration which has been determinable has been recognised.
The acquisition has contributed turnover of 1.1m and an operating profit of 0.1m in the current year and has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
The fair value table overleaf contains provisional numbers which will be finalised in the 2006 financial statements when further information is available.

In January 2002 all the earlier agreements were terminated by mutual consent.
They were commuted into a new three year Transaction Processing Agreement TPA and related Warrant Agreement over two million warrants, vesting over a three year period, effectively settling all amounts outstanding under earlier trading arrangements.

In addition the Group had benefited from a short term $250m credit facility that had been negotiated during the year to 31 May 2004.
During the current year the Eurobond and the existing bank loans were repaid and redeemed in full.
They were replaced by loans drawn down against a new $850m revolving credit facility negotiated with a syndicate of banks.
Misys plc Notes to the financial statements continued 26 Creditors falling due after more than one year continued BANK LOANS The bank loans drawn down under the facility comprise 252.4m denominated in US dollars and 65.0m in sterling.
At the year end the dollar loan bore interest at 3.71% and the sterling loans bore interest at an average of 5.6%.
All bank loans are unsecured.
The facility was first drawn on 14 March 2005 and has a maximum maturity of five years.
Facility arrangement fees of 1.3m were included in the original carrying value of net debt.
The amounts in the balance sheet have been stated net of unamortised facility arrangement fees of 1.2m.
These costs are allocated to the profit and loss account over the expected term of the facility.
The facility is guaranteed by Misys plc and certain other companies within the Group.
The Group is subject to certain financial covenants on its bank borrowings: these include a minimum ratio of operating profit, before depreciation and goodwill amortisation, to net interest: and a maximum ratio of net debt to operating profit, before depreciation and goodwill amortisation.
LISTED BONDS The five year Eurobond was a 750m, fixed rate bond issued by Misys International Finance Limited and listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
The bond bore interest at 6.37%, but the net funding raised was converted into floating rate US dollar denominated debt through a series of interest rate and currency swaps.
JPMorgan Europe Limited contracted to subscribe on maturity of the bond or on its earlier redemption up to 750m for an issue of up to 750 million 1 preference shares by Misys International Finance Limited.
JPMorgan Europe Limited sold its rights and obligations with regard to these preference shares to Interval Limited, a company that is independent of the Group.
Misys International SA, a wholly owned subsidiary within the Group, paid 370m as an initial payment to Cordon Limited a wholly owned subsidiary of Interval Limited.
This figure represented the discounted price which was supplemented by a further payment of 232m on maturity redemption of the bond, for the rights to the preference shares noted above.
At 31 May 2004 Misys Finance Limited, also a wholly owned subsidiary within the Group, had a balance of 45m deposited with 64 Interval Limited at an interest rate of 4.63%.
Issue costs of 7.7m were included in the original carrying value of the debt, these had been fully amortised during the course of the prior year.

The lapse provisions are mostly recoverable from members and are shown gross of the recoverable element, with the corresponding entry of 31.8m 2004: 21.3m held within other debtors.
REGULATORY REVIEWS AND COMPLAINTS Regulatory reviews and complaints provisions principally comprise amounts in respect of a specific review relating to a former network member, the costs arising from the initial stages of a regulatory review of structured capital at risk sales, the estimated costs arising from both received and future endowment complaints and the FSAVC and pensions review processes.
These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next four years and are partly recoverable from members and through insurance cover.
The amounts are shown gross of the estimated recoverable element 16.1m 2004: 3.1m which is included within other debtors.
As a result the net provision is 18.8m 2004: 9.0m.
The net amounts charged to the profit and loss account in the year in respect of regulatory reviews and complaints were 7.9m 2004: 10.0m including 8.9m 2004: 8.0m recognised as operating exceptional items note 2.
The final cost of settling these complaints is uncertain and depends upon the proportion of complaints ultimately proved to be valid, the redress cost on each policy, which in turn is dependent upon the performance of investment markets, and the administrative 65 cost of handling the complaints.
The recoverability of these costs will depend on whether the Sesame or member insurance policy responds, and if so, what level of excess will apply and the ability of Sesame to recover costs from members, many of whom are no longer part of the network.
In establishing the year end provision, assumptions have been made regarding each of these based on recent actual experience.
As a result the actual cost may differ from that for which provision has been made.
No allowance has been made for any future regulatory action by the FSA.
FUTURE ENDOWMENT COMPLAINTS During the year, along with the rest of the industry, Sesame has experienced a significant increase in the volume of complaints from consumers about advice given by IFAs regarding the sales of endowment policies.
This is due to increased consumer awareness, poor stock market performance over the life of the policies and action taken by the majority of product providers to crystallise their liabilities with regard to past endowment complaints.
Given the levels of endowment complaints currently being received, the increasing rate at which these are being upheld and the expectation that the volumes of future complaints will be significant, a provision has been made for the Directors best estimate of the costs associated with complaints that will be received in the future with respect to past sales of endowments.
Assets have been recognised with respect to the estimated recoveries from professional indemnity insurance and the network members who gave the original advice.
The net provision established for future endowment complaints at 31 May 2005, and included within the regulatory reviews and complaints provision, was 10.0m 2004: nil.
The charge in respect of this provision has been disclosed as an operating exceptional item given its size note 2.
In calculating this figure significant judgement has been applied in estimating the volume of future endowment complaints, particularly where Sesame does not have records of the total number of endowment sales made prior to the acquisition by Misys of the networks involved.
In addition, the volume and pattern of future endowment complaints will in part depend on future actions by product providers and the performance of investment markets.
The effect of the significant uncertainties around the potential volume of future endowment complaints is compounded by the uncertainties surrounding the calculation of ultimate redress costs described above.
As a result the final cost of future endowment complaints, which includes the administrative costs of handling these complaints, could be greater or less than that for which provision has been made.
OTHER PROVISIONS Contingent consideration is non interest bearing and is payable in cash.
The property provisions comprise the net present value of the estimated future costs of vacant and sublet properties and the excess over market value for occupied properties of subsidiaries acquired in previous years.
The provision relating to vacant and sublet properties is expected to be utilised on average over the next eight years, and the excess over market value provision over the next seven years.
Included in other provisions are amounts primarily in respect of litigation and non property related onerous contracts.

com 30 Post retirement benefits Group DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEMES The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes covering the majority of its employees.
The costs of these pension schemes were 12.9m 2004: 9.4m and are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at either the beginning or the end of the financial year.
DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES In 2003 04 the active members of the UK final salary scheme ceased to accrue benefits on the basis of their final salary during the year.
Thereafter the benefits of the active members accrue on a money purchase defined contribution basis.
As a result of this change, the final salary benefits of all members have crystallised and a one-off curtailment gain of 2.3m was credited to operating profit in the prior year.
The Group also made special payments in the prior year of 5.9m to address the deficit in the scheme.
In addition, the Group operates a number of other smaller defined benefit arrangements.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 31 May 2002: the assumptions of which have been updated to 31 May 2005 by qualified independent actuaries.
The full triennial actuarial valuation of the UK scheme as at 31 May 2005 is currently in progress, the results of which will be reflected in the 2006 Annual Report.
The last full triennial actuarial valuations of the other Group schemes were carried out on a number of different dates: these have been updated to 31 May 2005 by qualified independent actuaries.

These financial liabilities are non interest bearing, denominated in sterling and expected to crystallise within the next four years.
com 31 Financial instruments continued Floating rate liabilities comprise bank loans and loan notes and bear interest at rates linked to UK and US LIBOR or UK base rates, depending on the denomination of the loan.
Included in the prior year floating rate liabilities was debt raised under the listed bond and 40.0m drawn down under a revolving US dollar credit facility.
Fixed rate liabilities comprise property provisions and finance leases.
The liabilities on which no interest is paid comprise non interest bearing contingent consideration and property provisions.
These financial liabilities are disclosed in notes 24, 26 and 27.
Details of the Groups undrawn borrowing facilities at 31 May 2005 are given in note 26.
FINANCIAL ASSETS Financial assets primarily comprise cash deposits and fixed asset investments.
Cash which bears interest at nominal rates comprises 26.8m 2004: 29.0m denominated in sterling, 15.5m 2004: 8.4m in US dollars, 6.6m 2004: 15.2m in euros and 7.0m 2004: 6.2m in other currencies.
Cash deposits of 45.7m 2004: 48.2m denominated in sterling, accrue interest at rates based on LIBOR.
These deposits are restricted from access by the Group and are primarily held within Sesame.
All remaining cash is available on demand.
Fixed asset investments of 4.1m 2004: 3.5m primarily comprise contractual rights to receive financial assets from participating in US and European Technology Funds which are non interest bearing.
Full details of these assets are given in note 19.
In addition, the Group has a sterling financial asset of 13.8m 2004: 7.1m in respect of a debtor falling due in more than one year, this primarily relates to non interest bearing amounts recoverable from members in the IFA network and are expected to be recovered within the next four years note 22.
FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the Groups financial instruments.
The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidated sale, excluding accrued interest.
Market values, where available, have been used.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates with the exception of fixed asset investments.
Short term financial instruments are assumed to have a fair value equal to book value.
The book value is the amount recorded in the balance sheet.
Forward foreign currency contracts have been shown at fair value, based on the market price of comparable derivative financial 69 instruments at the balance sheet date.
No market measure readily exists by which to assess the fair value of the Groups investments, primarily in the US and European Technology Funds, and future cash flows cannot be predicted.
As a result, a fair value cannot be established and therefore it has been assumed that their fair value is equal to book value.
The fair value of the WebMD warrants held at 31 May 2004 note 23 was established using the Black Scholes model.

Misys plc Notes to the financial statements continued 31 Financial instruments continued CURRENCY EXPOSURES To ensure compliance with the Groups treasury policy, as explained in the Financial review, the Groups practice is to hedge currency exposures using forward foreign currency contracts.
All the material assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operation involved are hedged using forward foreign currency contracts.
Exceptions to this are foreign currency borrowings treated as a hedge against foreign net investments, and in the prior year the initial payment of 370m made by Misys International SA MISA to Cordon Limited in 2002 note 26, the functional currency of MISA being US dollars.
Accordingly, the Group has no material currency exposures requiring disclosure.
HEDGES Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
All the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions.
The table below shows the extent to which the Group has off balance sheet unrecognised and on balance sheet deferred gains and losses in respect of forward foreign currency contracts used as hedges at the end of the year.
It also shows the amount of such gains and losses which have been included in the profit and loss account for the year and those which are expected to be included in next years or later profit and loss accounts.
Under the Groups accounting policy, foreign currency assets and liabilities which are hedged using forward foreign currency contracts are translated at the forward contract rate inherent in the contracts.
Consequently, the carrying value of the relevant asset or liability effectively includes the gain or loss on the hedging instrument.
Such gains and losses are treated as deferred for the purpose of the table below.
UNRECOGNISED DEFERRED all figures in millions Gains Losses Total Gains Losses Total At 1 June 2004 0.8 0.3 0.5 2.9 2.2 0.7 Less that arising in prior year recognised in the year to 31 May 2005 0.8 0.3 0.5 2.9 2.2 0.7 Arising in the year to 31 May 2005 not recognised at 31 May 2005 0.4 0.5 0.1 0.4 1.0 0.6 70 At 31 May 2005 0.4 0.5 0.1 0.4 1.0 0.6 At 31 May 2005 analysed as: Expected to be recognised within one year 0.4 0.5 0.1 0.4 1.0 0.6 Expected to be recognised in more than one year In addition to the amounts disclosed in the above table, as at 31 May 2004 the Group had unrecognised gains of 1.9m in respect of cross currency swaps.
There were no such swaps in place as at 31 May 2005.
32 Contingent liabilities Within Sesame, the regulatory requirements governing the IFA network business receive significant attention.
Compliance with these regulations is subject to a process of ongoing review and appraisal by both the FSA and the Directors.
Provision is made for the costs arising from specific regulatory reviews as well as from complaints from consumers, both received and anticipated, where these can be reliably estimated as set out in note 27.
In common with other companies in the sector a thematic review of Sesames and its predecessor networks past sales of structured capital at risk products was carried out by the FSA during the year.
As a result of the review Sesame agreed to reassess the conclusions reached on historic complaints received, review promotional material and carry out a review of the suitability of a sample of sales selected from the general population of sales of structured capital at risk products made by its network members.
The reassessment of the complaints received to date is at an advanced stage.
Based on the results of this work to date a charge of 2.8m 2004: nil has been recorded during the year.
The charge has been disclosed as an operating exceptional item note 2 given its size and the fact that the majority of the sales were made before Misys acquired the relevant member network.
The review of promotional material is at an early stage.
Sesame has recently provided the FSA with the preliminary findings of the review and, on the basis of this review, it is likely that a further more detailed review of some element of the full population of sales will be necessary.
The extent of any further review is not known and will be subject to agreement with the FSA.
com 32 Contingent liabilities continued At present, it is not possible to estimate the costs of review or redress that may be incurred as a result of any further review work, including that in respect of promotional material that may be required.
As a result no provision has been made for this potential liability.
Further review work is likely to result in additional provisions being made which themselves may be material.
Contingent liabilities that are quantifiable comprise property rental guarantees arising in the normal course of business, amounting to 8.5m 2004: 7.3m.
The Company has entered into a netting arrangement with its bankers, under which the Companys liabilities may be offset by the funds of other Group undertakings.
The Directors are of the opinion that this arrangement does not have a material impact on the results and financial position of the Company.
The Groups subsidiaries and the Company can be parties to legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
Whilst the outcome of current outstanding actions and claims remains uncertain, it is expected that they will be resolved without a material impact on the Groups financial position.
