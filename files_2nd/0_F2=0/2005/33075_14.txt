Useful information for shareholders DIVIDENDS An interim dividend in respect of each financial year is normally declared by United Utilities in November December for payment in the following February.
Since 2003, the final dividend in respect of the financial year has been recommended by directors in May June and paid in August, following approval by shareholders in July.
Previously, the final dividend was paid in October.
The following table sets out the dividends paid on ordinary and A shares in respect of the past five financial years, excluding any associated UK tax credit in respect of such dividends.

The first tranche of proceeds, received during September 2003, raised 501.2 million net of costs from the issuing of A shares.
The second tranche of proceeds is expected to be received in June 2005, reecting the subscription for further A shares.
All A shares will then be consolidated and reclassied as ordinary shares on the basis of one ordinary share for two A shares.
The first dividend for which the initial A shares ranked was the 2003 04 interim dividend.
The amount of this dividend is 50 per cent of that paid on an ordinary share.
In the table below, dividends per ordinary share and per ADS for periods prior to the rights issue have been re-presented for comparative purposes to take account of the bonus element of the first stage of the rights issue.
The factor applied to dividends for the periods prior to the rights issue is 0.9072, calculated using 576.0 pence per ordinary share, this being the closing price on 25 July 2003, the last business day prior to the announcement of the rights issue.

iii The exchange rate at the date the 2005 final dividend will be paid is assumed to be 1.00 $1.89.
Future dividends will depend upon the companys earnings, financial condition and other factors.
Interim and final dividends paid in the past are not necessarily indicative of future interim and final dividends, or the future relationships between them.
A person resident in the UK for tax purposes who receives a dividend from United Utilities is generally entitled to a tax credit, currently at a rate of one-ninth of the net dividend or ten per cent of the sum of the net dividend and the associated UK tax credit.
For further information, see the Taxation section on page 101.
Cash dividends are paid by United Utilities in pounds sterling.
Exchange rate uctuations will affect the US dollar amounts received by owners of the ADSs on the conversion by the Depositary of such cash dividends paid.
In addition, uctuations in the exchange rate between pounds sterling and US dollars will affect the US equivalent of the quoted pound sterling price of ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange, and as a result are likely to affect the market price of ADSs in the US.

MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES United Utilities PLC was incorporated on 1 April 1989 and registered with the Registrar of Companies in England and Wales number 2366616.
The memorandum of association of the company provides that its principal objects are, among other things, to be a holding company and to carry on business as a general commercial company and to carry on any trade or business or activity of any nature which may seem to the directors to be capable of being conveniently or advantageously carried on.
Directors A director of the company shall not vote, and shall not be counted in the quorum, in relation to any resolution of the directors or of a committee of the directors on any resolution concerning any contract, arrangement, transaction or any proposal whatsoever to which the company is or is to be a party and in which he has, directly or indirectly, any material interest other than, inter alia, as a shareholder of the company.
So far as the legislation allows, the directors may exercise all the companys powers to borrow money: to mortgage or charge all or any of the companys undertaking, property present and future, and uncalled capital: to issue debentures and other securities: and to give security either outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability or obligation of the company or any third party.
Such powers can be amended by the sanction of a special resolution.
A director shall be capable of being appointed or re-elected a director despite having attained the age of 70 or any other age and shall not be required to retire by reason of his having attained any particular age and section 293 of the UK Companies Act 1985 the Companies Act relating to the appointment and retirement as directors of persons who are aged 70 or over shall not apply.
A director shall not be required to hold any shares in the company.
The articles provide for directors to retire from ofce and seek re-election by the companys shareholders in various circumstances.
A director appointed by the board must retire at the next annual general meeting of the company following his appointment.
A non-executive director who has served as a director of the company for a continuous period of nine years or more must retire from ofce at each following annual general meeting.
Ordinarily each director must retire at the third annual general meeting following his appointment or last reappointment by the shareholders of the company.
In addition, at each annual general meeting one third of the directors or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three, the number nearest to but not exceeding one third must retire from ofce by rotation.
In determining the number and the identity of the directors required to retire by rotation, those directors required to retire as a result of their initial appointment by the board and non-executive directors retiring under the nine year provision, are not taken into account.
In each case, the retiring directors may offer themselves for reappointment by the companys shareholders at the meeting at which they are required to retire.
Shares The holders of shares of the company are entitled to the profits of the company available for distribution and resolved to be distributed, in proportion to the number of shares held by them and the amounts paid up or credited as paid up on such shares.
With the sanction of an ordinary resolution of the company, the directors may offer any holders of shares the right to elect to receive further shares, credited as fully paid, instead of cash in respect of the whole or part of any dividend.
All dividends unclaimed for a period of 12 years after having been declared shall if the board so resolves be forfeited and shall cease to be owed by the company.
The holders of the A shares shall be entitled, contemporaneously with any payment of dividend to the holders of ordinary shares, to be paid rateably with the holders of ordinary shares a dividend for each A share which is equal to one-half of the dividend to be paid to the holder of an ordinary share.
If the company is wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a special resolution of the company and any other sanction required by law, divide among the members in specie the whole or any part of the assets of the company and may, for that purpose, value any assets and determine how the division shall be carried out as between the members or different classes of members.
Any such division may be otherwise than in accordance with the existing rights of the members but, if any division is resolved otherwise than in accordance with such rights, the members shall have the same right of dissent and consequential rights as if such resolution were a special resolution passed pursuant to section 110 of the Insolvency Act 1986.
The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of the assets in trustees on such trusts for the benefit of the members as he, with the like sanction, shall determine, but no member shall be compelled to accept any assets on which there is a liability.
The holders of the A shares shall be entitled to share rateably with the holders of the ordinary shares in the distribution of profits or assets if any to the holders of ordinary shares on the basis of a distribution with respect to each A share which is equal to one-half of the distribution to the holder of an ordinary share.
All substantive resolutions put to a vote at a general meeting shall be decided on a poll.
All other resolutions shall be decided on a show of hands.
Every holder of ordinary shares present in person shall on a show of hands have one vote, and every holder of ordinary shares present in person or by proxy shall on a poll have one vote for every ordinary share of which he is the holder.
The chairman of a general meeting has absolute discretion in determining whether a resolution is a substantive resolution or another resolution and his decision shall be final.
If a shareholder has been given notice in accordance with section 212 of the Companies Act and has failed to provide the necessary information in accordance with the statutory timeframes, the shareholder shall not be entitled to exercise their right to vote at the meeting: a further restriction exists should a call or any other sum due and payable by the shareholder remain unpaid.
The holders of A shares are entitled to receive notice of any general meeting of the company and to attend, speak or vote at such general meeting on the same basis as the holder of ordinary shares provided that each holder of A shares on a poll shall have only one vote for every two A shares held.
Section 80 of the Companies Act provides that, to allot any relevant securities as dened in the Companies Act and which includes, with certain exceptions, shares and securities convertible into shares, the directors require authorisation which may be given in the articles of association or by ordinary resolution of shareholders stating the maximum amount which may be allotted and the date on which the authority will expire being not more than five years from the date of such authority.
Shareholders have rights of pre-emption in respect of the allotment of equity securities as dened in the Companies Act and which includes, with certain exceptions, shares and securities convertible into shares which are, or are to be, paid up in cash, although these pre-emptive rights can be displaced or modied by a special resolution of the shareholders or under the articles of association.
The authority given by such a special resolution can last for five years.
In practice, a company whose shares are publicly traded is unlikely to receive shareholder consent for the disapplication of pre-emptive rights in respect of shares representing more than five per cent of its existing issued ordinary share capital.
100 United Utilities Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Subject to the exceptions referred to below, if a holding of any class or classes of shares or any interest in them other than certain exempt interests reaches three per cent of the aggregate nominal value of the issued voting share capital or, in the case of the companys share capital being divided into different classes, issued voting shares comprised in the relevant class, the shareholder whether foreign or domestic must notify the company of the interest within two business days of the acquisition taking the holding over three per cent and of any subsequent increase or decrease in the extent of that interest.
There are less stringent requirements for certain categories of interests in shares non-material interests, for example, interests held by managers of certain collective investment schemes.
Non-material interests need only be disclosed when the aggregate of those interests and other interests other than exempt interests reaches a threshold of ten per cent of the aggregate nominal value of the share capital concerned.
The Companies Act gives a public company power to require persons whom it believes to be, or to have been within the previous three years, interested in its voting shares, to disclose prescribed particulars of those interests.
Failure to supply the information required is an offence and may lead to disenfranchisement of the relevant shares and a prohibition on their transfer and on dividend and other payments in respect of them and the issue of additional shares in respect thereof.
Under the Rules Governing Substantial Acquisitions of shares, where a person or company acquires 15 per cent or more of the voting rights of a listed company or where an acquisition increases their holding of shares or rights over shares which would amount to an increase in voting rights by a whole percentage point, notication must be given to the company and the London Stock Exchange no later than noon on the business day following the date of acquisition.
General meetings 21 clear days written notice is required to be given to shareholders for an annual general meeting or an extraordinary general meeting where a special resolution is to be proposed.
Ordinarily, only 14 clear days notice is required for an extraordinary general meeting.
An annual general meeting can be held at shorter notice provided that all the shareholders entitled to attend and vote agree: and, in the case of an extraordinary general meeting, if shareholders holding 95 per cent in nominal value entitled to attend and vote agree.
If a shareholder is unable to attend the general meeting they are entitled to appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf and a corporate body is entitled to appoint a corporate representative to vote on its behalf.
Not more than 15 months shall elapse between one annual general meeting and the next.
In addition to the directors, a member or members holding not less than one-tenth of the paid-up capital can require that a general meeting be convened.
There are no limitations imposed by UK law or the companys memorandum and articles of association which restrict the right of non-UK resident or non-UK citizen owners, as opposed to UK resident or citizen owners, to hold shares in the company or to exercise any voting rights.
However, shareholders with a registered address outside the UK are not entitled to receive notice from the company, including notices of general meetings, unless they have given the company an address in the UK to which such notices may be sent.
All shares of the same share class rank pari passu.
TAXATION The following is a summary of the principal US federal and UK tax considerations that are likely to be material to the ownership and disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs by a holder that is a resident of the US for the purposes of the income tax convention which was signed on behalf of the US and the UK on 24 July 2001 and entered into force on 31 March 2003 the Treaty or, in the circumstances described below, the previous income tax convention between the US and the UK the Old Treaty and in either case is fully eligible for benets thereunder an eligible US holder and satisfies the three conditions set out below.
The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a holder of ordinary shares or ADSs.
In particular, the summary deals only with eligible US holders which hold ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets, and does not address the tax treatment of investors which are subject to special tax rules, such as banks, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, persons that elect mark-to-market treatment, persons that hold ordinary shares or ADSs as part of an integrated investment including a straddle comprised of an ordinary share or ADS and one or more other positions, and persons that own, directly or indirectly, ten per cent or more of the voting stock of the company.
This summary is based on the Treaty, the Old Treaty and the tax laws of the US and the UK in effect on the date hereof, which are subject to change.
For taxes withheld at source, the Treaty is effective from 1 May 2003.
Holders should however note that any person that is or would have been entitled to greater benets under the Old Treaty than under the Treaty may be able to elect to have the provisions of the Old Treaty apply in their entirety for a period of twelve months from the date on which the Treaty would otherwise have effect.
Holders should consult their own tax advisers with respect to the implications in their own particular circumstances of the election, including the possible entitlement to a special US foreign tax credit described below under Taxation of dividends United States.
This summary applies to eligible US holders if they are: the beneficial owner of the ordinary shares or ADSs and of any dividends received: an individual citizen or resident of the United States, a US corporation, or otherwise subject to US federal income tax on a net income basis in respect of their shares or ADSs: and not also a resident of the United Kingdom for UK tax purposes and they do not hold ordinary shares or ADSs in connection with the conduct of a business through a permanent establishment or the performance of personal services through a xed base in the UK.
Special rules, including a limitation of benets provision, apply in limited circumstances under the Treaty to shares or ADSs owned by an investment or holding company.
This section does not discuss the treatment of such holders.
Holders should consult their own advisers regarding the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs in the light of their particular circumstances, including the effect of any state, local, or other national laws.
beneficial owners of ADSs will be treated as owners of the underlying shares for US federal income tax purposes and deposits and withdrawals of shares in exchange for ADSs will not result in the realisation of gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes.
Taxation of dividends United Kingdom There is no UK withholding tax on dividends.
A shareholder resident for UK tax purposes in the UK who receives a dividend from the company will generally be entitled to a tax credit equal to one-ninth of the dividend.
The Old Treaty allowed an eligible US holder to claim a similar tax credit from the UK Revenue.
However, it also provided for a notional UK withholding tax which, in the case of an eligible US holder that owned, directly or indirectly, less than ten per cent of the voting stock of the company, was set at 15 per cent of the aggregate of the dividend and the credit.
This meant that no amount was actually payable to such holders by the UK Revenue in respect of their tax credit entitlement.
The Treaty provides neither for the right to claim the credit nor for the notional withholding tax.
The result is that no eligible US holder will be entitled by virtue of the Treaty to an additional payment from the UK Revenue on receipt of a dividend from the company.
United Utilities Annual Report & Accounts 2005 101 Useful information for shareholders continued United States Eligible US holders must include dividends received in ordinary income on the date such a holder or ADS depositary received them.
The dividends will be treated as foreign source income.
Eligible US holders should determine the amount of dividend income by converting pounds sterling into US dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the date of such holders or the depositarys, in the case of ADSs receipt of the dividend.
Subject to certain exceptions for positions that are hedged or held for less than 61 days, an individual eligible US holder generally will be subject to US taxation at a maximum rate of 15 per cent in respect of qualied dividends received before 2009.
Dividends received with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs will be qualied dividends if United Utilities was not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, and is not, in the year in which the dividend is paid, a passive foreign investment company PFIC.
Based on United Utilities audited financial statements and relevant market data, United Utilities believes that it was not treated as a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes with respect to its 2003 or 2004 taxable year.
In addition, based on United Utilities audited financial statements and its current expectations regarding the value and nature of its assets, the sources and nature of its income, and relevant market data, United Utilities does not anticipate becoming a PFIC for its 2005 taxable year.
If an eligible US holder qualied for benets under the Old Treaty, then such holder may be eligible, subject to generally applicable limitations, to receive a special US foreign tax credit equal to one-ninth of the amount of certain cash dividends that such holder receives on the ordinary shares or ADSs, so long as such holder makes an election to include in income, as an additional notional dividend, an amount equal to the tax credit.
This foreign tax credit is generally only available with respect to dividends paid before 1 May 2003, unless such holder elects to apply the Old Treaty in its entirety for a period of 12 months from the effective date of the Treaty.
Taxation of capital gains United Kingdom Gain realised by an eligible US holder on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs will not be subject to UK taxation, provided that such shares are not held in connection with a UK branch or agency or in relation to a corporate holder a UK permanent establishment.
United States Gain realised on the sale, exchange or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs will be included in income for US tax purposes and will be long-term capital gain if the ordinary shares or ADSs were held for more than one year.
The net long-term capital gain recognised by an individual eligible US holder before 1 January 2009 generally is subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 15 per cent.
Backup withholding tax and information reporting Distributions made on ordinary shares and proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares or ADSs that are paid within the UK or through certain US-related financial intermediaries to US holders are subject to information reporting and may be subject to a backup US withholding tax unless, in general, the US holder complies with certain procedures or is a corporation or other person exempt from such withholding.
Holders that are not US persons generally are not subject to information reporting or backup withholding tax, but may be required to comply with applicable certication procedures to establish that they are not US persons in order to avoid the application of such information reporting requirements or backup withholding tax to payments received within the US or through certain US-related financial intermediaries.
Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax A transferee of ordinary shares will generally be required to pay UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax at a rate of 0.5 per cent of the consideration paid for the transfer.
However, no UK stamp duty should be payable on the transfer of an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS, provided that any instrument of transfer is executed and remains at all times outside the UK, and no UK stamp duty reserve tax should in any event be payable on an agreement to transfer an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS.
