NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 SEGMENTAL REPORTING Segmental information is presented in respect of the Groups geographical and product group segments.
The primary segment, geographical areas, is based on the Groups management and internal reporting structure.
The individual operations based in the countries within each geographic segment are considered to have similar operational risk and generate a similar level of financial return for the Group.
Inter-segment revenues are charged according to internally agreed pricing terms that are designed to be equivalent to an arms length basis, and have been consistently applied throughout 2004 and 2005.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated assets and liabilities comprises headquarter items that are not specifically attributable to one segment and there is no reasonable basis available to allocate them.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one accounting period.
Primary Segment by Geographical Areas For management purposes the Group is currently organised into three operating areas: Europe: North America, Australia and New Zealand NAA : and Developing Markets and geographical segmental information is presented on this basis.
Segment revenue is based on the geographic location of the Groups customers and segment assets are based on the geographic location of the assets.

c Share-based remuneration The Group has adopted the optional transitional arrangement permitted by IFRS 1 which allows companies previously disclosing the fair value charge to adopt IFRS 2 fully retrospectively to all options granted but not fully vested by the reporting date.
Accordingly all such share awards that were not fully vested as at 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004 are included in the tables below which analyse the IFRS charge for 2005 and 2004.
The Group has used the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value of one award on the date of the grant of the award.
25 Reckitt Benckiser Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Continued 4 EMPLOYEES CONTINUED Table 1: Fair value of awards with options outstanding at 31 December 2005 and 2004.
26 Reckitt Benckiser Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 4 EMPLOYEES CONTINUED c Share-based remuneration continued Notes Scope: Executive Share Awards including Share Options awarded under the 1999 Share Option Plan and Restricted Shares awarded under the Restricted Share Plan are awarded to the Top 400 Management Group.
Other Share Awards represent SAYE Schemes, offered to all staff within the relevant geographic area and a number of Executive Share Ownership Policy Plan SOPP awards.
Individual tranches of these awards are not material for detailed disclosure therefore have been aggregated in the table above.
Contractual Life: Executive Share Awards have a contractual life of ten years but vest according to EPS growth criteria over a three year period.
Accordingly, the cost is spread over the three years of the performance period.
Other share awards have contractual lives of either three, five or seven years.
Performance criteria: Executive Share Awards are subject to performance criteria based on compound average annual growth CAAG rates in earnings per share over the performance period.
Other Share Awards are generally not subject to any criteria other than the employees continued employment.
Executive Share Awards included in the above table vest as follows: CAAG of 6%: 40% of awards vest: 7% CAAG: 60%: 8% CAAG: 80%: 9% CAAG: 100%.
The assumptions made within the valuation calculation with respect to the achievement of performance criteria are based on the Directors expectations in light of the Groups business model and relevant published targets.
Under the terms of the Plans, early exercise is not permitted therefore the effect of early exercise is not incorporated into the calculation.
The calculation also assumes that there will be no leavers in the following year.
No material modifications have been made to the Plans in 2004 or 2005 for the purposes of the valuation.
Volatility: An estimate of future volatility is made with reference to historical volatility over a similar time period to the performance period or the contractual life as appropriate.
Historical volatility is calculated based on the annualised standard deviation of the Groups daily share price movement, being an approximation to the continuously compounded rate of return on the share.
Income statement charge: the income statement charge may not exactly equal one third of the total fair value included in the table above due to adjustments for in-year lapses or award revisions.
The weighted average share price for the year was 17.00 2004 14.44 d Pension and other post-retirement commitments The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees, which are principally of the funded type.
The Groups two most significant defined benefit pension schemes UK and US are both funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The Group also operates a number of other post-retirement schemes in certain countries.
The major scheme is in the US US retiree healthcare scheme, where salaried participants become eligible for retiree healthcare benefits after they reach a combined age and years of service rendered figure of 70, although the age must be a minimum of 55.
As at 31 December 2005 there were 2,816 2004 2,765 eligible retirees and 1,470 2004 1,517 current employees potentially eligible.
Pension costs for the year are as follows: 2005 2004 m m Defined contribution schemes 11 11 Defined benefit schemes net charge 14 11 Total pension costs recognised in the income statement Note 2 25 22 For the UK scheme, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2004 and updated at 31 December 2005.
For the US scheme, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 1 January 2005 and updated at 31 December 2005.
The projected unit valuation method was used for the UK and US scheme valuations.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries for the three major schemes as at 31 December 2005 were: 2005 2004 UK US US UK US US pension medical pension medical %%% %%% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.8 5.0 4.8 5.0 Rate of increase in pension payments and deferred pensions 2.8 2.8 Discount rate 4.8 5.5 5.5 5.3 5.8 5.8 Inflation assumption 2.8 4.0 2.8 4.0 Annual Medical cost inflation 10.5-4.5 10.5-4.5 Long-term expected rate of return on: Equities 7.4 10.8 7.8 10.0 Bonds 4.3 5.0 4.3 7.0 Other 5.9 6.1 The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
For the UK scheme the mortality assumptions were based on PMA92 and PFA92 tables, with allowance for projected improvements in mortality rates in 2004.
In addition, the net discount rate has been reduced by 0.25% to allow for further improvements in mortality.

30 Reckitt Benckiser Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 7 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic Basic Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company 2005 669m 2004 577m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period 2005 727,061,855 2004 714,855,797.
Diluted Diluted Earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The Company has three categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Executive options, Employee sharesave schemes and Convertible Capital Bonds.
The options only dilute earnings when they result in the issue of shares at a value below the market price of the share and when all performance criteria if applicable have been met.
As at 31 December 2005 there were 14.0m 2004 13.9m of Executive share options not included within the dilution because the contingent performance targets had not been met.
The reconciliation between profit for the year and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of the diluted earnings per share is set out below: 2005 2004 Profit for Earnings Profit for Earnings the year Average number per share the year Average number per share m of shares pence m of shares pence Profit attributable to shareholders 669 727,061,855 92.0 577 714,855,797 80.7 Dilution for Executive options outstanding 13,496,383 12,960,413 Dilution for Employee Sharesave Scheme options outstanding 726,783 937,121 Dilution for Convertible Capital Bonds outstanding 1,970,687 5 25,791,345 On a diluted basis 669 743,255,708 90.0 582 754,544,676 77.1 After the appropriate tax adjustment, the profit adjustment represents the coupon on Convertible Capital Bonds.
The Earnings per share impact reflects the effect of that profit adjustment and the assumption of the issue of shares on conversion of bonds.

The amount originally stated for brands represents the fair value at the date of acquisition of brands since 1985.
Other includes product registration and distribution rights.
The brands, goodwill and certain other intangibles are considered to have indefinite lives for the reasons noted in the Accounting Policies and accordingly are subject to an annual impairment review.

Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections based on historical operating results, short term budgets, medium term business plans and longer term extrapolation.
The long-term extrapolations assume a growth rate of no more than the long-term inflation assumption for the relevant markets range of 2% 6%.
A pre-tax discount rate of 11% 2004 11% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
A higher rate is used where appropriate to reflect specific risks associated with the relevant asset.

The reserves of subsidiary undertakings have generally been retained to finance their businesses.
The credit for invested share awards relates to amounts charged to the income statement under IFRS 2 and credited to reserves.
Reserves The merger reserve arose in 1999 following the combination of Reckitt & Colman plc and Benckiser N. V. to form Reckitt Benckiser plc.
This transaction was accounted for as a merger.
The equity element of Convertible Bonds recognises the compound nature of these instruments by including an element of their total value within equity.
This element has reduced to zero at 31 December 2005 following the final conversion of the bonds in March 2005 see Note 15.
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedge transactions that are extant at year end.
The capital redemption reserve is required to maintain the Groups capital following the Groups market purchases and subsequent cancellations of the Companys share capital.
The reserve consists of the nominal value of the shares purchased and cancelled see Note 20.
The foreign currency translation reserve contains the accumulated foreign exchange differences from the translation of the financial statements of the Groups foreign operations that are not considered integral to the operations of the parent company, arising when the Groups entities are consolidated.
The reserve also contains the translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net exposure in a foreign currency.

The Group has also adopted the transitional arrangement which allows companies that have previously disclosed the fair value charge to apply IFRS 2 retrospectively to all grants not vested at 1 January 2005.
This approach is encouraged by the standard and gives consistency across reporting periods.
As a result of the above, an incremental charge to net income of 11m has been included in 2004.
The Group has recognised a share award reserve within the profit and loss reserve in the balance sheet to reflect the cumulative charge under IFRS 2 in respect of outstanding share awards.
The deferred tax impact is a debit to deferred tax of 8m at 1 January 2004, a debit of 16m at 31 December 2004, and a 2m credit to the income statement for 2004. b IAS 19: Employee benefits The Group has adopted IAS 19 by recognising in full the surplus deficit on defined benefit schemes and other employee related liabilities in the Group balance sheet at the date of transition.
The Group has included movements in the surplus deficit within the income statement and statement of movement in equity as required by IFRS.
The Group has also adopted early the amendment to IAS 19 issued on 16 December 2004 allowing all actuarial gains and losses to be taken to the SORIE in the year in which they arise.
In reversing the SSAP 24 accounting treatment and adopting IAS 19, the Group balance sheet is credited with 84m being 109m less deferred tax of 25m at 1 January 2004 and 130m being 184m less deferred tax of 54m at 31 December 2004.
The impact on the income statement from reversing the SSAP 24 charge and including the IAS 19 charges is 2m in 2004, which is included within operating costs.
Actuarial losses of 76m less tax of 22m are shown in the statement of movement in equity.
c IAS 32: Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation IAS 32 requires that where financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, the components are classified separately on the balance sheet.
The Groups Convertible Capital Bond is such an instrument and accordingly 45m and 9m representing the split between debt and equity components has been reclassified from debt to equity in the balance sheets of 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 respectively.
These amounts are based on the fair value of the components on issue.
Additionally under IAS 32, the Groups 5% cumulative preference shares fall to be classified as debt in the balance sheet and the dividends classified as financial expense in the income statement.
Accordingly, a balance sheet adjustment of 5m is reflected at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004, while 0.2m is reclassified in the income statement from dividends to net financial income.
d IFRS 3: Business combinations IFRS prohibits the amortisation of goodwill, requiring at least annual impairment reviews to be undertaken.
Accordingly, goodwill balances at 1 January 2004 are no longer subject to amortisation, resulting in a credit to net operating expenses in 2004 of 4m 2m after tax and an equivalent debit to goodwill at 31 December 2004. e IAS 39: Financial instruments: recognition and measurement Under IAS 39 and IFRS 1, the Groups policy is to recognise the fair value of financial derivative instruments on the balance sheet with effect from 1 January 2004.
Accordingly, financial assets of 1m and financial liabilities of 3m have been recognised on the balance sheet as at 1 January 2004.
As at 31 December 2004, financial liabilities of 4m were recognised, resulting in a 2m 1m after tax charge to financial income in 2004. f IAS 17: Leases The Group has applied the requirements of IAS 17 to its leases and accordingly has reclassified certain leases from operating to finance leases to reflect the substance of the transaction according to IFRS.
The total amount of assets and liabilities added to the balance sheet in respect of finance leases is 10m each, at both 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004. g IAS 38: Intangible assets Computer software that is not an integral part of related hardware is classified as an intangible asset under IFRS, whereas such assets were classified under tangible assets under UK GAAP.
Reclassifications of 4m and 2m have been made between tangible and intangible assets at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 respectively.
h IAS 10: Events after the balance sheet date In accordance with IAS 10, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability in the financial statements, as there is no present obligation at the balance sheet date, as defined by IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Accordingly the final dividends for 2003 of 99m and for 2004 of 131m are fide-recognised in the balance sheets for 2003 and 2004 respectively.
Dividends Note 8 for 2004 are adjusted by 32m to reflect these timing adjustments.
i IAS 14: Segment reporting In accordance with IAS 14, the Group has defined its primary segment as geographical and its secondary segment as product group.
Analysis of net revenues and operating profit by geographical area primary segment and of net revenues by product group secondary segment are set out in Note 1.
47 Reckitt Benckiser Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS Continued 28 EXPLANATION OF ADJUSTMENTS FROM UK GAAP TO IFRS CONTINUED j IAS 7: Cash flow statements The Cash Flow Statement is presented in accordance with IAS 7.
The Groups cash and investments balances are not impacted by the change of accounting basis.
However, the Group has presented short-term investments separately from cash and cash equivalents as required by IAS 7.
Short-term investments represent those deposits with a maturity of over three months from inception.
The other adjustments do not impact the movement of cash in and out of the Group and so there are no material effects on the cash flow aside from the presentation format required by IAS 7. k IAS 12: Deferred tax Under IAS 12, deferred tax is recognised in respect of nearly all taxable temporary timing differences arising between the tax base and the book value of most balance sheet items.
The application of this principle may result in the recognition of additional temporary differences when compared to UK GAAP.
Accordingly the Group now recognises a net deferred tax liability of 122m at 1 January 2004, the date of transition.
This adjustment does not impact the income statement.
l Other adjustments Under IFRS, provisions are required to be analysed as those expected to be utilised within one year and after more than one year.
Accordingly, 4m are reclassified from non-current liabilities to current liabilities as at 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2005 respectively.
For presentational purposes, the minority interest has been reclassified to equity on the face of the balance sheet.
Taxation is provided on the conversion adjustments at the appropriate rate and is separately described above where material.
