Provision is made for the future rental cost of vacant property.
In calculating the provision required, account is taken of the duration of the lease and any recovery of cost achievable from subletting.
Property provisions occur principally in the USA and UK and relate to a variety of lease commitments.
The longest lease terms for each country are to 2014 and 2016 respectively.
Pension mis-selling provision In previous years provision has been made in respect of claims for compensation against a Group subsidiary arising from the mis-selling of pension advice and pension products.
The outstanding liability from this issue was satisfied during the year.
Litigation provisions The Group is subject to various claims and legal proceedings principally consisting of alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance reinsurance and consulting services.
A balance sheet provision is established in respect of such issues when it is probable that the liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated.
The Group analyses its litigation exposures based on available information, including external legal consultation where appropriate, to assess its potential liability.
Where appropriate the Group also provides for the cost of defending such matters.
Where a litigation provision has been made it is stated gross of any third party recovery.
"All such recoveries are included as ""other debtors"" within trade and other receivables."
At 31st December 2005, in connection with certain litigation matters, the Group's litigation provisions include an amount of 17.8 million 2004: 6.6 million to reflect this gross basis and the corresponding insurance recovery has been included within trade and other receivables.
