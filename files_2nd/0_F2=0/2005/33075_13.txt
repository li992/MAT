During the year ended 31 March 2004, the group announced a five-for-nine rights issue to raise a total of 1 billion, structured so that the proceeds are received in two stages.
On 26 August 2003, the rights issue was approved by shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting of United Utilities PLC, and authority was given for the issuance of up to 638,000,000 A shares of 50 pence each.
The first tranche of the proceeds, received during September 2003, raised 501.2 million net of costs from the issuing of 309,286,997 A shares.
The second tranche of proceeds is expected to be received in June 2005, reecting the subscription for further A shares.
All A shares will then be consolidated and reclassied as ordinary shares on the basis of one ordinary share for two A shares.
Basic and diluted earnings per share have been restated for all periods prior to the rights issue to reect the bonus element of the rights issue as required by FRS 14 Earnings per share.
The same adjustments are required under US GAAP.
The discontinued operations within the selected financial data relate to the sale of the energy supply business in August 2000.

2 Discontinued operations relate to the sale of the energy supply business in August 2000.
3 Exceptional items, which are disclosed separately under UK GAAP in accordance with FRS 3 Reporting financial performance, comprise: 1 2005 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Financial year $m m m m m m UK GAAP: Business restructuring 56.1 29.7 4.6 3.8 11.9 16.6 FRS 11 adjustment to carrying value of telecoms assets 25.5 profit on sale or termination of operations 8.5 4.5 4.3 34.0 profit on disposal of the energy supply business 191.2 profit loss on disposal of xed assets 7.7 4.1 2.4 39.9 21.1 2.7 4.7 11.9 174.6 Further details of exceptional items under UK GAAP are given on page 17.
United Utilities Annual Report & Accounts 2005 95 Information for shareholders Selected consolidated financial data continued 4 Operating profit from continuing operations before interest and tax is stated after the items from continuing operations scheduled below.
The following table sets out the US GAAP equivalent to UK GAAP exceptional items i. e. the restructuring charges, the profit on disposal of the energy supply business, the profit on sale or termination of operations, adjustment to the value of telecommunications assets, and the profit or loss on disposal of xed assets from continuing and discontinued operations: 1 2005 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Financial year $m m m m m m US GAAP Continuing operations: Business restructuring 60.1 31.8 2.4 3.8 11.9 16.6 profit on sale or termination of operations 5.9 3.1 4.3 4.3 Currency translation adjustment 6.8 41.3 profit loss on disposal of xed assets 7.7 4.1 2.4 46.5 24.6 0.5 14.9 53.2 16.6 Discontinued operations: profit on disposal of the energy supply business 167.0 167.0 The amount for profit or loss on disposal of xed assets is the same under UK and US GAAP, for the years ended 31 March 2005 and 2004, as are the profit on sale or termination of operations for the year ended 31 March 2004 and business restructuring for the years ended 31 March 2003, 2002 and 2001.
For business restructuring the increase under US GAAP of 2.1 million in the year ended 31 March 2005 and the reduction of 2.2 million in the year ended 31 March 2004 relate to costs being recognised in different accounting periods.
The profit on sale or termination of operations for the year ended 31 March 2005 reduced by 1.4 million under US GAAP, as the carrying value of goodwill, included in the profit and loss account as a realised cost of disposal, is higher under US GAAP as goodwill has not been amortised since adoption of SFAS 142 on 1 April 2002.
For the profit on sale or termination of operations in the year ended 31 March 2003, the reduction under US GAAP of 38.3 million related to the provision at 31 March 2002 that reected the groups share of net liabilities in IEBA, the Argentine utility.
In the year ended 31 March 2003, the group concluded it no longer had a participating interest and therefore ceased to account for the investment as a joint venture, with the resulting release of the 38.3 million share of liabilities included within provisions under UK GAAP.
Under US GAAP, no share of liabilities was recorded at 31 March 2002, as an investor should discontinue recording losses of an investment when the investment has been reduced to zero unless the investor has an obligation or commitment to fund these liabilities.
The currency translation adjustments under US GAAP relate to Argentina.
Under UK GAAP, currency translation adjustments on net borrowings used to finance foreign investments are taken to the statement of total recognised gains and losses to offset the foreign exchange exposure.
Under US GAAP, this offset is not available since the group elected not to designate derivative instruments as hedges.
In the year ended 31 March 2003, there was no currency translation adjustment resulting from the investment in IEBA, because the investment had been reduced to zero at 31 March 2002.
Under UK GAAP, the group performed an impairment review within its telecommunications business in accordance with FRS 11 in the year ended 31 March 2003.
This resulted in an exceptional adjustment to value of 25.5 million representing tangible assets of 14.6 million, definite-lived intangible assets of 8.6 million and goodwill of 2.3 million.
Under US GAAP, there was no indication of impairment of tangible or definite-lived intangible assets in the telecommunications business on an undiscounted cash ow basis in accordance with SFAS 144.
In addition, no impairment of goodwill under SFAS 142 was required.
The reduction under US GAAP of profit on disposal of the energy supply business in August 2000 of 24.2 million related to a 36.0 million difference in the onerous contract provisions released on disposal due to the application of discounting under UK GAAP offset by 11.8 million due to the lower carrying value of goodwill under US GAAP which had been amortised.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill had previously been written off to reserves, but on disposal it is included in the profit and loss account as a realised cost of disposal.
5 For the purposes of calculating the weighted average number of shares used in the earnings per share calculations, the A shares have been treated as part paid ordinary shares, two A shares being equivalent to one ordinary share.
The same treatment is required under US GAAP.
The adjustment factor applied to the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares is based on the consideration received from the first stage of the rights issue.
The adjustment factor is 0.9176, calculated using 531.5 pence per ordinary share, being the closing price on 26 August 2003, the date of approval of the rights issue at the extraordinary general meeting.
The adjustment factor of 0.9176 is calculated as follows: Theoretical ex-rights fair value per share 487.70 0.9176 Fair value per share immediately before exercise of rights 531.5 The theoretical ex-rights fair value per share is calculated as follows: Fair value of all outstanding shares Total amount received from exercise of rights Number of shares outstanding before exercise Number of shares issued in the exercise 556.8 million ordinary shares x 531.5 pence 309.3 million A shares x 165 pence 487.70 556.8 million ordinary shares 309.3 million A shares The A shares have been treated as part paid ordinary shares, two A shares being equivalent to one ordinary share.
96 United Utilities Annual Report & Accounts 2005 6 Calculated based on a ratio of two ordinary shares to one ADS.
7 The first dividend for which the initial A shares ranked was the 2003 04 interim dividend: the amount of the A share dividend is 50 per cent of that paid on an ordinary share.
8 Dividends per ordinary share for periods prior to the rights issue have been re-presented for comparative purposes to take account of the bonus element of the first stage of the rights issue.
The factor applied to the prior period dividend per share is 0.9072, calculated using 576.0 pence per ordinary share, the closing price on 25 July 2003, the last business day prior to the announcement of the rights issue.
9 For the purposes of calculating basic earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue under US GAAP is the same as under UK GAAP.
10 For the purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to xed charges, earnings consists of profit on ordinary activities from continuing operations before tax, before adjustment for minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries and profits or losses from joint ventures plus xed charges, and amortisation of capitalised interest less capitalised interest and minority interests.
Fixed charges consists of interest expensed and capitalised plus amortised premiums, discounts and capitalised expenses related to indebtedness and the interest portion in rent expense.
11 Net leverage is dened as net debt loans and related derivatives, finance leases and overdrafts less cash at bank and in hand and managed funds and short-term investments as a percentage of net debt plus equity shareholders funds.
Net debt is a UK GAAP measure, required by FRS 1 Revised Cash ow statements, but is considered a non-GAAP measure for the purpose of US GAAP as discussed on page 15.
12 The difference between group turnover in 2005, 2004 and 2003 under US GAAP of 2,249.4 million, 2,051.4 million and 1,837.9 million respectively, and group turnover under UK GAAP of 2,253.9 million, 2,060.0 million and 1,878.8 million respectively, is due to the revenue recognition difference between UK and US GAAP of 4.5 million 2004: 8.6 million, 2003: 40.9 million as shown in note 37 k of the summary of differences between UK and US GAAP.
13 Net income and shareholders equity under US GAAP have been restated to reect the translation of loans at spot rates instead of the contract rates in the hedging derivatives, with a consequential impact on taxes.
This resulted in the following increase decrease in the amounts previously reported: 2004 2003 2002 Financial year ended 31 March m m m Net interest payable 139.7 31.2 83.1 Tax charge on ordinary activities 41.9 9.4 24.9 2004 2003 2002 At 31 March m m m Long-term obligations 25.4 114.3 83.1 Current liabilities 7.6 34.3 24.9 Shareholders equity 17.8 80.0 58.2 # 14 Adjusted basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing adjusted profit for the year by the adjusted weighted average number of shares in issue.
The adjusted profit for the year excludes deferred tax, exceptional items, discontinued operations and goodwill amortisation.
This adjusted measure has been presented to provide a better understanding of the trading position of the group and a better comparison of annual results.
For additional information on the reasons for these adjustments and a detailed calculation under UK GAAP, see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
Disclosure of adjusted earnings per share is expressly permitted under UK GAAP.
The adjusted weighted average number of shares has been restated for all periods prior to the rights issue using an adjustment factor based on the consideration received from the first stage of the rights issue and assumed proceeds from the second stage, which are due to be received in June 2005.
The adjustment factor is 0.8646 calculated using 531.5 pence per ordinary share, being the closing price on 26 August 2003, the date of approval of the rights issue at the extraordinary general meeting.
This measure has been included to reect the full bonus element of the rights issue which arose at the first stage, as demonstrated by the movement in the share price following the approval of the rights issue at the extraordinary general meeting.
The adjustment factor of 0.8646 is calculated as follows: Theoretical ex-rights fair value per share 459.54 0.8646 Fair value per share immediately before exercise of rights 531.5 The theoretical ex-rights fair value per share is calculated as follows: Fair value of all outstanding shares Total amount received from exercise of rights Number of shares outstanding before exercise Number of shares issued in the exercise 556.8 million ordinary shares x 531.5 pence 309.3 million ordinary shares x 330 pence 459.54 556.8 million ordinary shares 309.3 million ordinary shares Based on consideration received from the first stage of the rights issue 165 pence per A share plus anticipated proceeds from the second stage 165 pence for a further A share.
