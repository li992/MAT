Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
The following is an analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset: 2005 2004 million million Deferred tax liabilities 123.6 108.4 Deferred tax assets 9.2 7.8 Net deferred tax liability 114.4 100.6 The Group did not recognise deferred income tax assets of 2.6 million 2004 2.9 million in respect of tax losses amounting to 7.5 million 2004 8.2 million that can be carried forward against future profits.
This is because there are no current forecasts for profits against which those losses could be utilised.
33 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates several pension arrangements: the Groups pension cost included within profit from operations was 15.8 million 2004 12.6 million, being 8.7 million 2004 5.7 million in respect of its defined benefit pension arrangements and 7.1 million 2004 6.9 million in respect of its defined contribution arrangements.
The Groups pension cost in respect of its defined benefit pension arrangements included within finance costs was 0.6 million 2004 1.0 million.
UK scheme The Group operates a principal UK pension scheme which has two plans: the UK Benefit Plan which is a funded defined benefit arrangement, and the UK Contribution Plan, which is a funded defined contribution arrangement.
Both plans are administered by an independent company and their assets are held under trust separately from those of the Group.
The pension costs in respect of the UK benefit plan are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent firm of actuaries.
The most recent actuarial valuation used for this purpose was carried out as at 1 January 2003.
This has been updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19, in order to assess the liabilities at 31 December 2005.
Following the valuation, it was agreed to adopt an employer contribution rate of 10.9% of pensionable pay, effective from 1 January 2004.
In addition annual payments of 5.5 million were agreed for 2003, 2004 and 2005 and further annual payments of 4.3 million for the subsequent 11 years.
Previously, the rate payable had been 13.3% of pensionable pay since 1 January 2001.
94 Alliance UniChem Plc Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 33 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED Other schemes The Group also sponsors a number of defined benefit plans outside of the UK, some of which are material.
In The Netherlands there is a defined benefit pension plan, which is administered by a separate pension fund.
In France there are insured arrangements providing retirement and termination benefits.
In Norway there are five defined benefit plans in place.
Four of the plans are insured and are accounted for as defined benefit plans.
The fifth plan is an industry-wide multi-employer defined benefit plan operated by a government agency.
This plan has been treated on a defined contribution basis under IAS 19 because the Group is unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The contributions currently payable to this plan are calculated as a flat percentage of salary across all the employers and no account is taken of the actual accrued liabilities and assets of a particular employer.
As at 31 December 2005, the agency provided a notional allocation of the assets and liabilities.
The Groups notional allocation of the deficit at 31 December 2005 was 7.7 million 2004 2.1 million surplus.
The government agency is reviewing the structure of this scheme with a view to identifying the assets and liabilities of the various participating employers.
The results of this work may give a different allocation of the assets and liabilities from the notional allocation.
Until this work is completed the scheme will continue to be accounted for as a defined contribution plan in accordance with IAS 19.
The main financial assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations are set out below.
The financial assumptions for the non-UK plans are weighted averages of the assumptions used for the overseas plans included.

The derivation of the overall expected return on assets reflects the actual asset allocation at the measurement date combined with an expected return for each asset class.
The bond return is based on the prevailing return available on bonds.
The return on equities and other assets is based on a number of factors including: the income yield at the measurement date: the long-term growth prospects for the economy in general: the long-term relationship between each asset class and bond returns: and the movement in market indices since the previous measurement date.
A breakdown of the expected returns for each category of assets is as follows: 2005 2004 % % UK Plan Equities 7.4 7.5 Bonds 4.0 4.9 Other 5.9 6.1 Other European plans Equities 8.0 7.0 Bonds 4.0 4.1 Other 5.0 4.8 The actual return of the plan assets is summarised as follows: 2005 2004 UK benefit Other UK benefit Other plan European Total plan European Total million million million million million million Actual return on plan assets 16.9 3.2 20.1 9.0 2.3 11.3
