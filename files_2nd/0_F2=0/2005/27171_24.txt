Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2005 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of preparation For the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2005 the Company had the option to prepare its financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 'IFRS', as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board 'IASB'.
The Board has elected to continue to adopt UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 'UK GAAP' and therefore has prepared its financial statements in accordance with the new Financial Reporting Standards issued as part of the programme to converge UK GAAP with IFRS.
Figures for the year ended 31 December 2004 have been restated accordingly.
"The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice for ""Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies "" the SORP issued in December 2005."
"The SORP has been adopted early due to the implementation of Financial Reporting Standard 26 ""Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement""."
"The same accounting policies used for the year ended 31 December 2004 have been applied, with the following exceptions: i The method of determining the Valuation of Investments is stated in section e : and ii Under FRS21 ""Events after the Balance Sheet Date"" dividends should only be accrued in the accounts if they are a liability at the Balance Sheet date."
As the final dividend for the year and the three interims for the current financial year are approved by the Shareholders at the AGM each year no provision has been made for the final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2004 or 31 December 2005. iii The total column of the Income Statement, rather than the revenue column, represents the profit and loss account of the Company.
iv Dividends paid are now shown in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders' Funds rather than on the face of the Income Statement.
The impact of these changes is shown in note 2. b Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are treated as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where no ex-dividend date is available dividends are recognised on their due date.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
The fixed returns on debt securities and non-equity shares are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short term deposits and interest payable is accrued to the end of the year.
c Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue account except as follows: transaction costs on the acquisition or disposal of investments are charged to capital: expenses are charged to realised capital reserves where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee and the finance costs on borrowings have been allocated 30 per cent to revenue and 70 per cent to realised capital reserves to reflect the Company's investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
The performance fee has been charged 100% to realised capital reserves.
Murray International Trust PLC 47 Notes to the Financial Statements continued d Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Company's taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between capital and revenue within the Income Statement on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates using the Company's effective rate of tax for the year.
e Investments Investments are classified as fair value through the profit and loss, and recognised on the trade date and are initially measured at fair value.
Investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which is assumed to be the bid price, and changes in fair value are included in the Income Statement as a capital item.
f Borrowings Monies borrowed to finance the investment objectives of the Company are stated at the amount of the net proceeds immediately after issue plus cumulative finance costs less cumulative payments made in respect of the debt.
The finance costs of such borrowings are allocated to years over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount and are charged 30 per cent to revenue and 70 per cent to realised capital reserves to reflect the Company's investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.
g Exchange rates Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Translation of all other foreign currency balances including foreign assets and foreign liabilities is at the middle rates of exchange at the year end.
Differences arising from translation are treated as a gain or loss to capital or revenue within the Income Statement depending upon the nature of the gain or loss.
h Derivative financial instruments Financial derivatives are measured at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the Income Statement.
If capital in nature, the associated change in value is presented as a capital item in the Income Statement.
Restatement for first time adoption of revised UK GAAP As stated in the accounting policies, the Board have elected to continue to adopt UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP and therefore complies with the new Financial Reporting Standards issued as part of the programme to converge UK GAAP with IFRS.
Figures as at 31 December 2003 and 2004 have been restated and the impact is shown below.
The effect of this change is an increase in the net assets at 31 December 2004 of 4,502,000 2003 increase of 4,551,000.
Under FRS 26 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' investments should be valued at their fair value which is deemed to be bid market price.
Previously, listed investments were valued at mid market prices.
The financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2003 and 2004 have been restated to reflect investments at their fair value.
Under FRS 21 'Events after the Balance Sheet Date' dividends should only be accrued in the accounts if they are a liability at the Balance Sheet date, therefore they are now recognised in the period in which they are declared, not in the period in which they are proposed.
No provision has therefore been made for the final dividend on Ordinary shares for the years ended 31 December 2004 and 2005.
The financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2003 and 2004 have been restated to remove the final dividends that were accrued at those dates.
Dividends are no longer recognised through the Income Statement, instead these are taken to the Statement of Movements in Shareholders' Funds as an appropriation of equity.

The terms of these loans permit early repayment at the borrower's option which may give rise to additional amounts being either payable or repayable in respect of fluctuations in interest rates since drawdown.
Since the Directors, currently, have no intention of repaying the loans early, they have been included in the accounts to 31 December 2005 at their principal amounts.
The Company has a 50,000,000 multi currency facility which expires on 10 March 2010 and an uncommitted facility of 25,000,000.
None of the 25,000,000 facility has been drawn down.

Derivatives and other financial instruments The Companys financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise securities and other investments, cash balances, loans and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement, and debtors for accrued income.
The Company also has the ability to enter into derivative transactions in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, futures and options, the purpose of which is to manage currency and market risks arising from the Company's activities and bank loans and futures.
The main risks the Company faces from its financial instruments are i market price risk, being the risk that the value of investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest rate or currency movement, ii interest rate risk, iii liquidity risk, iv foreign currency risk, and v credit risk.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
The Manager's policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the year.
The numerical disclosures exclude short-term debtors and creditors, other than for currency disclosures.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Company's operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions as a consequence of price movements and movements in exchange rates.
It is the Board's policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets and the stock selection process, as detailed on page 18, both act to reduce market price risk.
The Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to review investment strategy.
The Manager seeks, when deemed appropriate, to manage exposure to market movements on investments by using futures as a hedge against potential adverse market movements.
Futures are used to effect a change in asset allocation efficiently and quickly.
During the year, futures were used to gain exposure to the United States.
At 31 December 2005 the fund held no futures 31 December 2004 future held with an unrealised gain of 303,000.
During the year ended 31 December 2005 a gain of 629,000 was realised 2004 gain of 1,384,000.
60 Murray International Trust PLC Interest rate risk The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Borrowings comprise fixed rate, revolving, and uncommitted facilities.

The weighted average interest rate on bank loans is based on the interest rate payable, weighted by the total value of the loans.
The maturity dates of the Company's loans are shown in note 15 to the financial statements.
The floating rate assets consist of cash deposits on call earning interest at prevailing market rates.
The non-interest bearing assets represent the equity element of the portfolio.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The fair value of borrowings has been calculated at 85,013,580 as at 31 December 2005 2004 90,489,000 compared to an accounts value in the financial statements of 82,803,000 2004 85,236,000 note 14.
The fair value of each loan is determined by aggregating the expected future cash flows for that loan discounted at a rate comprising the borrower's margin plus an average of market rates applicable to loans of a similar period of time and currency.
All other assets and liabilities of the Company are included in the Balance Sheet at fair value.
62 Murray International Trust PLC Liquidity risk The Company's assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of loan and overdraft facilities note 14.
Foreign currency risk A significant proportion of the Company's investment portfolio is invested in overseas securities and the Balance Sheet can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
It is not the Company's policy to hedge this risk on a continuing basis but the Company may, from time to time, match specific overseas investment with foreign currency borrowings.
A significant proportion of the Company's borrowings, as detailed in note 14 on page 57, are in foreign currency as at 31 December 2005.
The Manager seeks, when deemed appropriate, to manage exposure to currency movements on borrowings by using forward foreign currency contracts as a hedge against potential foreign currency movements.
At 31 December 2005 the Company had foreign currency contracts, details of which are listed on page 64.
During the year a loss of 8,841,000 2004 loss of 6,684,000 was realised.
The revenue account is subject to currency fluctuation arising on overseas income.
The Company does not hedge this currency risk.
Credit risk The Company places funds with authorised deposit takers from time to time and is therefore potentially at risk from the failure of any such institution of which it is a creditor.
The Company expects to place any deposits on a short term basis only.
