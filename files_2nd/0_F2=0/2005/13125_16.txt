Financial instruments The Finance Directors Financial review on page 22 provides an overview of the Groups financial risk management and treasury policies.
Short term debtors together with short term creditors, excluding bank overdrafts and amounts due in respect of development land, are excluded from the analysis below.
a Interest rate and liquidity risk At 30 June 2005, the Group had total unsecured bank borrowing facilities of 373.0m, representing 300.0m committed facilities and 73.0m uncommitted facilities.
In order to manage its interest rate risk, the Group may enter into interest rate swaps, options and forward rate agreements.
All interest rate exposures are sterling denominated.
After taking account of interest rate swaps, as at 30 June 2005, 87.5m 2004: 75.0m of interest bearing debt was at a fixed rate of 4.3% 2004: 3.9%.
Interest rate swaps totalled 87.5m and they expire between February 2006 and May 2008.
All other interest bearing debt is subject to floating interest rates linked either to LIBOR or base rate at a range of margins.
This amounts to other debt of 39.4m 2004: 56.9m.
Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates.
The amounts receivable within debtors after more than one year and fixed asset investments are non-interest bearing.
The amounts due in respect of development land are non-interest bearing.
b Fair values of financial assets and liabilities All the Groups financial assets and liabilities are in sterling as follows: The Group 2005 2004 Book value Book value m m Financial assets Cash at bank and in hand 23.7 1.2 Other amounts receivable after more than one year 0.7 0.5 24.4 1.7 The Group 2005 2004 Book value Book value m m Financial liabilities Bank overdraft 23.1 27.2 Bank loans 104.5 105.0 Amounts due in respect of development land 84.3 85.8 211.9 218.0 As at 30 June 2005, the only material difference between the book and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities related to amounts due in respect of development land, which had a book value of 84.3m and a fair value of 77.7m.
The fair value of these were calculated by discounting expected future cash flows to present value.
As at 30 June 2004, book value was 6.9m higher than fair value.
The fair value of the Groups interest rate hedging arrangements based on the market value of comparable instruments at 30 June 2005 was an unrealised loss of 0.2m 2004: 1.4m unrealised gain.
