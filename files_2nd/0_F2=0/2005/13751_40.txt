The acquisition of an additional 39.8% in Birra Peroni SpA resulted in US$172 million goodwill while the acquisition of a further 26.5% in Amalgamated Beverage Industries Ltd resulted in US$419 million goodwill.
Other acquisitions within Africa and Europe added a further US$11 million.
Goodwill arising from the acquisitions is being amortised over 20 years, with the exception of purchased goodwill in ABI, which the directors believe has an indefinite life.
This is consistent with the treatment of goodwill that arose on the acquisition of Suncrush, which was acquired by ABI on 8 June 1998.
The directors consider the goodwill to be supported by the existence of bottlers agreements with Coca-Cola Southern Africa Pty Ltd CCSA.
ABI has similar bottlers agreements in respect of other regions within South Africa.
These bottlers agreements, which are based on the Coca-Cola system, establish performance obligations as to production, distribution and marketing arrangements to maximise long-term growth in volume, cash ow and shareholder value of the bottler company.
The Coca-Cola system came into being during 1899 and has had a consistent history of growth and success since that date.
The Suncrush agreements with CCSA were established in 1955 and have been in place since then.
The current agreements are for a period of 10 years, with an extension of five years, expiring on 30 September 2007 and contain provisions for renewal at no cost.
ABI has had similar agreements since 1976 and they have always been renewed prior to expiry.
In the view of the directors, the bottlers agreements reect a long and ongoing relationship between the respective managements of ABI and CCSA.
The directors have given due consideration to financial forecasts in respect of the ABI business, the history of dealings of ABI with CCSA and the established international practice of The Coca-Cola Company in relation to its bottlers agreements.
In light of the above factors, the directors believe that the Suncrush agreements will continue to be renewed at the end of their legal expiry dates and the commercial value of the Coca-Cola product will be maintained.
Accordingly, the directors are of the view that the goodwill of US$761 million 2004: US$335 million, as underpinned by the bottlers agreements, currently has an indefinite economic life.
The directors have performed a review for impairment at 31 March 2005 and are of the opinion that no provision is required.
The amount of cumulative goodwill in respect of purchased subsidiary and associated undertakings which has been set off against shareholders funds prior to 31 March 1998 was US$209 million at 31 March 2005 2004: US$187 million.
