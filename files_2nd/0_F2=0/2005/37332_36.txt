In calculating the tax charge on revenue profits, the deferred tax arising on capital allowances in respect of investment properties has been eliminated because experience has shown that these allowances are not in practice repayable.
Because capitalised interest is a permanent timing difference, the deferred taxation arising on capitalised interest is also eliminated when calculating adjusted earnings per share.

In addition, the deferred tax on capitalised interest on these properties is added back as this is a permanent timing difference.
