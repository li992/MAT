This review has resulted in a transfer of 3,977,000 from goodwill to intangible assets.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are any indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated, at acquisition, to cash-generating units CGUs, that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discounts rates, growth rates and expected changes to day rates and direct costs in the period.
Management estimates discounts rates using post tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the CGUs.
Growth rates and changes in day rates and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following years, due to the long-term nature of the relationships, based on an estimated real growth rate of 1.5%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the market.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the cash flows is 8.4%.
