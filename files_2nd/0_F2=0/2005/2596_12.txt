The fees for further assurance services principally related to due diligence and other duties carried out in respect of the acquisition of businesses.
The Group believes that, given their detailed knowledge of the Groups operations, its structure and accounting policies and the importance of carrying out detailed due diligence as part of the acquisition process, it is appropriate for this additional work to be carried out by the Groups auditors rather than another firm of accountants.
The Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent non-executive directors, reviews and approves the level and type of non-audit work which the auditors perform, including the fees paid for such work, to ensure that the auditors objectivity and independence is not compromised.
