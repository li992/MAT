Supplementary International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS basis results Additional IFRS basis information to enable consistent comparison of results for Prudentials insurance operations This information does not form part of the Groups financial statements.
The statutory basis results included on pages 62 to 195 are for the years 2005 and 2004.
These results reflect significant changes of accounting policies from those previously applied under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP.
For all except three IFRS standards these changes have been applied consistently in preparing the results for both years.
However, as permitted by the IFRS transition rules, and consistent with the approach of groups with significant banking operations, where retrospective application is complex and onerous, the 2005 results include the effects of adoption of the standards IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4 for the Groups insurance and other operations from 1 January 2005 rather than 1 January 2004.
The 2004 comparative results in those statements are therefore prepared on an inconsistent basis.
The pro forma IFRS basis comparative results shown below for 2004, reflect the estimated effect on the Groups 2004 results if IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4 had been applied from 1 January 2004 to the Groups insurance operations.
The main purpose of providing this pro forma information is to present the operating results for the UK insurance business and short-term fluctuations in investment returns for Jackson National Life JNL on a consistent basis.
Under IAS 39 and IFRS 4, the assets and liabilities of certain unit-linked and similar contracts of the UK insurance business are subject to remeasurement.
For JNL derivatives held for economic hedging purposes are fair valued under IAS 39 with value movements recorded in the income statement giving rise to significant levels of volatility.
In addition, debt securities of JNL are fair valued with value movements taken directly to shareholders reserves through the statement of changes in equity.
