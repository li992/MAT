The Dairy Crest Fund, which is of the defined benefits type, is funded by contributions from employees and the Group.
The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
An actuarial assessment of the Dairy Crest Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2004 by the Funds actuary using the projected unit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted for the assessment were that, over the long term, the annual rate of return on the investments of 7.2% would be 2.6% higher than the increase in pensionable pay and 4.3% higher than the annual increase in present and future pensions in payment.
At the date of the assessment, the market value of the Dairy Crest Fund assets amounted to 451.9 million.
The actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 107% of the value of the members accrued benefits representing an actuarial surplus of 30.0 million.
The surplus is amortised over the service lives of Fund members on average 11.2 years as an even percentage of payroll resulting in a credit to the profit and loss account of 2.7 million.
The next actuarial valuation will be carried out as at 31 March 2007.
The pension debtor at 31 March 2005 was 5.2 million 2004 5.3 million.
The Group has charged 0.2 million 2004 0.2 million in respect of unfunded pensions for a director whose benefits are restricted by Inland Revenue limits.
Group contributions paid to the Dairy Crest Fund amounted to 7.0 million 2004 4.7 million.
FRS 17 was issued in November 2000.
However, it is not mandatory until the financial year ending 31 March 2006.
The Company is required to adopt International Accounting Standards IAS for the year ending 31 March 2006 and plans to move directly to the equivalent standard under IAS.
Under FRS 17 certain disclosures are required as to the potential impact on the balance sheet, profit and loss account and the statement of total recognised gains and losses as if this standard was adopted.
The calculation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2004 and updated by Aon Consulting to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2005.
This update does not represent a formal valuation.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
