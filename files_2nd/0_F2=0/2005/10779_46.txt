33 Pensions The group operates a defined benefit scheme, the N Brown Group Pension Fund, which provides benefits based on-final pensionable salaries.
The assets of the scheme are held separately in trustee administered funds.
The pension cost charged to the profit and loss account is calculated by a qualified actuary so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives within the scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 30 June 2003 using the projected unit method.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
It was assumed that the investment return would be 2.4% per annum higher than the rate of annual salary increase and 2.4% higher than the rate at which present and future pensions would increase.
