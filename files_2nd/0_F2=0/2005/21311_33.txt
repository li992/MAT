Barclays PLC Annual Report 2005 121 Financial review Average balance sheet Changes in net interest income volume and rate analysis The following tables allocate changes in net interest income between changes in volume and changes in interest rates for the last two years.
Volume and rate variances have been calculated on the movement in the average balances and the change in the interest rates on average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities.
Where variances have arisen from changes in both volumes and interest rates, these have been allocated proportionately between the two.
