The highest and lowest exposures occurred on different dates and therefore a net position of these exposures does not reflect a spread of the trading book.
The basis on which the trading book is valued each day is given in the accounting policies in note 1 g. Based upon the trading book exposure at 31st July, 2005 given above, a hypothetical fall of 10 per cent.
in market prices would result in a 1,995,000 2004 2,031,000 decrease in the group's income and net assets on the equity trading book and a 1,172,000 2004 168,000 decrease on the debt securities trading book.
However, the group's trading activity is a jobbing business where positions are managed throughout the day on a continuous basis.
Accordingly the result shown above is purely hypothetical.
