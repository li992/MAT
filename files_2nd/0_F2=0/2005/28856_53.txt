On repayment of the financing, any further amounts generated by the mortgages will be paid to the Group.
In 2004, the Group recognised net income of 26 million.
3 Certain finance lease receivables leveraged leases involve the Group as lessor obtaining non-recourse funding from third parties.
This financing is secured on the underlying leases and the provider of the finance has no recourse whatsoever to the other assets of the Group.
In 2004, the Group recognised net income of 13 million.
4 Other loans originated by the Group have been transferred to special purpose vehicles funded through the issue of notes.

section 03 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes on the accounts Financial statements Notes on the accounts continued 12 Loans and advances to customers continued Key economic assumptions used in measuring the value of retained interests at the date of securitisation resulting from securitisations completed during the year were as follows: U.

2 CPR with yield maintenance provision and thus prepayment risk is limited.
3 Population consists of securities whose collateral is guaranteed by US Government sponsored entities and therefore, no credit loss has been assumed.
5 Population consists of only investment grade senior tranches: therefore, no credit losses are included in the assumptions.
6 Prepayment speed has been stressed on an overall portfolio basis for US Agency retained interests due to the overall homogeneous nature of the collateral.
Consumer and commercial retained interests have been stressed on a security level basis.
The sensitivities depicted in the preceding table are hypothetical and should be used with caution.
The likelihood of those percent variations selected for sensitivity testing is not necessarily indicative of expected market movements because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear.
Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of a retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumptions.
This might not be the case in actual market conditions since changes in one factor might result in changes to other factors.
Further, the sensitivities depicted above do not consider any corrective actions that the Group might take to mitigate the effect of any adverse changes in one or more key assumptions.
Mortgage-backed securities Agencies have agreed to seek repayment only from the cash The Group sells originated mortgage loans to US Agencies in from the mortgage loans.
