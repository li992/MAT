Shaftesbury BACK 05. qxd 7 12 05 14:51 Page 23 Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting Policies Basis of Accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
The historical cost basis of accounting has been used with the exception of investment properties which are stated at revalued amounts in accordance with SSAP19 Accounting for Investment Properties and which requires a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 relating to depreciation and amortisation as explained below.
Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the audited financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to the balance sheet date.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no profit and loss account is presented for the Company.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated in the Companys balance sheet based at cost.
Previously investments in subsidiaries were stated at an amount equal to the subsidiaries net asset value.
This change in accounting policy had no effect on amounts reported in prior years.
Investment Properties Investment properties are revalued annually either by external professional valuers on an open market basis or by the Directors in the case of properties sold shortly after the year end.
Any surplus or temporary deficit arising on the revaluation of investment properties is transferred to or from the revaluation reserve.
Permanent diminutions in value below cost arising in the year are charged in the profit and loss account for that year.
Cumulative revaluation deficits which are considered to be permanent are written off against profit and loss account reserves.
Additions to properties include costs of a capital nature only.
All other property expenditure is written off in the profit and loss account as incurred.
No finance costs are capitalised.
Where refurbishment projects are in progress or are valued as completed at the balance sheet date, the costs to be incurred in completing such projects are accrued in full, to the extent they are contractually committed, in the financial statements.
Amounts received by way of dilapidations from tenants vacating properties are credited against the cost of reinstatement works.
Where the Group has no intention of carrying out such works, the amounts received are credited to the profit and loss account.
Purchases and Sales of Investment Properties Purchases and sales of investment properties are recognised in the financial statements on the date at which there is a legally binding and unconditional contract.
On the disposal of an investment property the surplus or deficit is calculated by reference to the book value at the date of sale and included in the profit and loss account.
Depreciation and Amortisation of Properties In accordance with SSAP 19, no provision is made for depreciation of freehold properties or amortisation of leasehold properties with over 20 years unexpired.
The Companies Act 1985 requires all properties to be depreciated which conflicts with the generally accepted accounting principle, set out in SSAP 19.
The Directors consider that, as these properties are held for long term investment and are revalued annually, to depreciate them would not give a true and fair view and it is necessary to adopt SSAP19 in order to give a true and fair view.
It is not practicable to quantify the depreciation or amortisation which might otherwise have been charged.
Depreciation of Other Assets Depreciation is provided on short leasehold office premises, equipment and motor vehicles to write their cost down to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives at the following rates: Short leasehold office premises - over the period of the lease on cost, assuming no residual value Equipment - 20% 25% per annum on cost Motor vehicles - 25% per annum on written down value 59 Shaftesbury BACK 05. qxd 7 12 05 14:51 Page 24 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting Policies continued Turnover Turnover includes rents invoiced to tenants, recognition of lease incentives in accordance with UITF 28 and recoverable expenses incurred on behalf of tenants.
Value added tax is excluded from all amounts.
The effect of UITF 28 is to spread the cost of any incentives given to lessees to enter into leases over the period from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the first rent review due under the lease and the lease expiry date.
Lease incentives are usually in the form of rent free periods.
Cost of Raising Finance Expenses and discounts relating to the issue of long term debt are deducted from the proceeds and written off in the profit and loss account over the life of the debt instrument.
Any premium arising on the issue of long term debt is added to the proceeds and credited to the profit and loss account over the life of the debt instrument.
The costs of organising long and medium term bank facilities are written off in the profit and loss account over the term of the facilities.
Financial Instruments Amounts receivable or payable under the terms of interest rate hedging agreements are accrued over the period to which they relate and are credited or charged to interest payable in the profit and loss account.
Deferred Taxation Deferred tax is provided in respect of all temporary timing differences arising from the differing treatment of certain expenditure for accounting and taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is not provided in respect of the corporation tax liability which could arise in the event of realisation of investment properties at the values stated in the financial statements.
Deferred tax liabilities are not discounted.
Deferred tax assets are recognised when recoverability is considered reasonably certain.

The difference between the weighted average and dilutive average number of Ordinary Shares arises from the potentially dilutive effect of outstanding options granted over Ordinary Shares.

Interest rate hedging The Group has in place the following interest rate hedging: 1.
Interest rate collars on 90 million notional principal maturing between October 2011 and June 2016 weighted average maturity 8.75 years.
The Group pays floating rate if benchmark LIBOR sets between 3.65% and 6.50% and a maximum of 6.50% if at any calculation date LIBOR sets above the upper limit.
If LIBOR sets below 3.65% the Group pays on average 5.28% for that period.
Each of these arrangements are extendable at the counterpartys option on expiry for up to a further 10 years at an average fixed rate of 5.28%.
A hedge on 35.25 million notional principal maturing in November 2012.
The Group pays 6.05% for a three month period if the benchmark LIBOR rate sets outside the ranges on the relevant calculation date falling: In the period to July 2008 3.00% - 6.00% In the period from August 2008 to August 2012 4.00% - 6.00% If LIBOR sets within these ranges the Group pays 4.80%.
The hedge is extendable at the counterpartys option in November 2012 for a further 10 years at 5.15%.
An interest rate hedge on 30 million notional principal at a fixed rate of 5.74% until March 2010.

The fair value of the LIBOR-linked loans are based on the LIBOR rate that would have been secured had the loans been drawn on the last day of the financial year.
The fair value of interest rate hedging agreements represents the net present value of the difference between the contracted fixed rates payable and the rates that could have been secured if those agreements were entered into on the last day of the financial year.
Information regarding interest and hedging rates was obtained from external sources.
