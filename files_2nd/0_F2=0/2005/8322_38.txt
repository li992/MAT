All are considered associates and International Power continues to equity account for Malakoff and HUBCO despite its shareholdings being less than 20% see note 40.
The Groups share of HUBCO and KAPCO was valued at 45 million 2004: 54 million and 149 million 2004: unlisted respectively, on the major Pakistan stock markets and the Groups share in Malakoff Berhad was valued at 203 million 2004: 159 million on the Kuala Lumpur stock market.
Market values for Group shareholdings in these investments were in excess of the respective book values at the year end.
A subsidiary, Al Kamil, is listed on the Muscat Securities Market and was valued at 15 million on 31 December 2005 2004: 14 million.
The reporting period of Malakoff Berhad does not coincide with International Powers financial year.
Consequently, the results of Malakoff Berhad for the period 1 December to 30 November are equity accounted by the Group each year.
This treatment prevents Malakoffs results being made publicly available before its own shareholders have received the information through dissemination by Malakoff Berhad.
