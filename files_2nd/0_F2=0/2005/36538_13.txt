NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Statement of Compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and interpretations adopted for use in the European Union and issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements are presented in sterling.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that investment and development properties, owner-occupied properties and derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently, other than the implementation of IAS 32 and IAS 39 as described in note 27, to the results, other gains and losses, assets, liabilities and cash ows of entities included in the consolidated financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that may affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Management believes that the estimates and associated assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are reasonable.
However, actual outcomes may differ from those anticipated.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period.
If the revision affects both current and future periods, the change is recognised over those periods.
Basis of Consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the group.
Control is assumed when the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity, or business, to bene t from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Where properties are acquired through corporate acquisitions and there are no signi cant assets or liabilities other than property, the acquisition is treated as an asset acquisition, in other cases the acquisition method is used.
Joint Ventures Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include the groups proportionate share of assets, liabilities, results and cash ows of joint ventures.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the groups interest in the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Where the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is greater than the cost, the excess, known as negative goodwill, is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Foreign Currency Foreign Currency Transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at exchange rates approximating to the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date and, unless they relate to the hedging of the net investment in foreign operations, differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Financial Statements of Foreign Operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The operating income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the period.
Signi cant transactions, such as property sales, are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of each transaction.
The principal exchange rate used to translate foreign currency denominated amounts in the balance sheet is the rate at the end of the year, 1 1.455 2004: 1 1.413.
The principal exchange rate used for the income statement is the average rate, 1 1.463 2004: 1 1.474.
Net Investment in Foreign Operations Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, including the effective portions of related foreign currency hedges, are taken to the translation reserve.
They are released to the income statement upon disposal of the foreign operation.
26 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Borrowings, Interest and Derivatives Borrowings Borrowings are held at amortised cost.
They are recognised initially at fair value, after taking account of any discount on issue and attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently, such discounts and costs are charged to the income statement over the term of the borrowing at a constant return on the carrying amount of the liability.
Derivative Financial Instruments policy effective from 1 January 2005 The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency movements and interest rate risks.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value, which equates to cost and subsequently remeasured at fair value, with changes in fair value being included in the income statement, except that a gain or loss on the portion of an instrument that is an effective hedge for the net investment in a foreign operation is recognised in equity.
Net Finance Costs Net finance costs include interest payable on borrowings, net of interest capitalised, interest receivable on funds invested, and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Capitalisation of Interest Interest is capitalised if it is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of development properties or the redevelopment of investment properties.
Capitalisation commences when the activities to develop the property start and continues until the property is substantially ready for its intended use.
Capitalised interest is calculated with reference to the actual rate payable on borrowings for development purposes or, for that part of the development cost nanced out of general funds, to the average rate.
Property Portfolio Tenant Leases Management has exercised judgement in considering the potential transfer of risks and rewards of ownership in accordance with IAS 17 Leases for all properties leased to tenants and have determined that all such leases are operating leases.
Development Properties Properties acquired with the intention of redevelopment are classi ed as development properties and stated at fair value.
Changes in fair value above cost are recognised in equity, and changes in fair value below cost are recognised in the income statement.
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction of a development property are capitalised.
When development properties are completed, they are reclassi ed as investment properties and any accumulated revaluation surplus or fide cit is transferred to retained earnings.
Investment Properties Investment properties are stated at fair value, being market value determined by professionally quali ed external valuers, with changes in fair value being included in the income statement.
Depreciation In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment or development properties.
Leasehold Properties Leasehold properties that are leased out to tenants under operating leases are classi ed as investment properties or development properties, as appropriate, and included in the balance sheet at fair value.
The obligation to the freeholder or superior leaseholder for the buildings element of the leasehold is included in the balance sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception.
Payments to the freeholder or superior leaseholder are apportioned between a finance charge and a reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Contingent rents payable, such as rent reviews or those related to rental income, are charged as an expense in the periods in which they are incurred.
Net Rental Income Rental income from investment property leased out under an operating lease is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Contingent rents, such as turnover rents, rent reviews and indexation, are recorded as income in the periods in which they are earned.
Rent reviews are recognised when such reviews have been agreed with tenants.
Lease incentives and costs associated with entering into tenant leases are amortised over the period to the first break option or, if the probability that the break option will be exercised is considered low, over the lease term.
Property operating expenses are expensed as incurred and any property operating expenditure not recovered from tenants through service charges is charged to the income statement.
27 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Property Portfolio continued Pro ts on Sale of Properties Pro ts on sale of properties are taken into account on the completion of contract, and are calculated by reference to the carrying value at the end of the previous year, adjusted for subsequent capital expenditure.
Plant, Equipment and Owner-occupied Property Owner-occupied property held under a finance lease is stated at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity.
The cost of owner-occupied property is depreciated through the income statement over the period to the end of the lease on a straight-line basis having due regard to its estimated residual value.
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, which is generally between three and five years.
Investments Investments for which the fair value can be reliably determined are classi ed as available for sale and carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity.
Other investments are carried at cost.
Employee Bene ts fide ned Contribution Pension Plans Obligations for contributions to fide ned contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as incurred.
fide ned Bene t Pension Plans The groups net obligation in respect of fide ned bene t pension plans comprises the amount of future bene t that employees have earned, discounted to determine a present value, less the fair value of the pension plan assets.
The discount rate used is the yield on AAA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a quali ed actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in equity.
Where the assets of a plan are greater than its obligation, the asset included in the balance sheet is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reduction in future contributions to the plan.
Share-based Employee Remuneration Share-based employee remuneration is determined with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted and charged to the income statement over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.
The fair value of share-based employee remuneration is calculated using the binomial option pricing model and is dependent on factors including the exercise price, expected volatility, option life and risk free interest rate.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has been applied to share options granted from November 2002.
Tax Tax is included in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustment in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable pro t, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro ts will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Trade Receivables and Payables Trade receivables and payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost and discounted to re ect the time value of money.

29 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 3 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS Primary and Secondary Segments The groups primary reporting format for the presentation of segmental information is the geographic location of its properties.
The secondary reporting format is by business sector.
Other Net Liabilities Other net liabilities include all operating assets and liabilities that can be allocated to the segment on a reasonable basis but exclude net debt.
Net debt cannot be allocated between countries within continental Europe.

During the year the Company has further developed its performance related bonus scheme such that an expectation of the amount payable in shares at the Companys option can be more accurately determined.
Therefore in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, this has been treated as equity settled and the credit in relation to this charge has been taken to other reserves.
In the prior year the Company had not formally determined the balance of cash equity settlement and whilst a split had been shown for indicative purposes as noted above, the credit was treated as cash settled within accruals.

At 31 December 2005 the total of such gains was 490.0 million with a potential tax effect of 150.0 million 2004: 390.0 million, potential tax effect 120.0 million.
35 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 8 TAX CONTINUED f Commentary UK corporation tax and deferred tax is calculated at a rate of 30% 2004: 30% and foreign tax is calculated using appropriate local rates.
Current tax is reduced by the French tax exemption, capital allowances, tax relief for capitalised interest and a prior year credit relating to Germany.
Under IAS 12, deferred tax provisions are made for the tax that would potentially be payable on the realisation of investment properties and other assets at book value.
For UK investment properties, deferred tax is calculated on the basis that properties will be realised predominantly through sale so that capital gains are reduced by indexation.
In 2004, Hammersons French properties, with the exception of 9 place Vendme, were elected into the SIIC tax exempt regime, when exit taxes totalling 70.8 million were incurred and deferred tax of 166.0 million was written back.
In 2005 an election was made in respect of the Villebon companies, for which 10.1 million of exit tax was provided on acquisition.
The SIIC rules require Hammersons French subsidiaries to distribute a proportion of their pro ts to Hammerson plc and allowance is made within deferred tax for the UK tax that may arise when dividends are received.
The tax on disposals may be reduced depending on how sales are structured.
In particular, if the group retains all capital allowances on UK disposals, the liability would be reduced by 65.0 million 31 December 2004: 45.0 million.
Current tax in the future will depend on whether there are disposals of properties with gains, but the group should continue to bene t from French SIIC status, capital allowances, tax relief for capitalised interest and brought forward tax losses.
The groups tax position will change substantially if UK REITs are introduced and Hammerson elects for REIT status, in which event it is anticipated that a conversion charge will be payable and most of the groups deferred tax will be written back.
9 DIVIDENDS The proposed final dividend of 13.91 pence per share 2004: 12.47 pence per share was approved by the Board on 27 February 2006 and is payable on 17 May 2006 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 18 April 2006.
The dividend has not been included as a liability at 31 December 2005.
The total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2005 was 19.71 pence per share 2004: 17.92 pence per share.
The 51.0 million dividend included in the Reconciliation of Equity comprises the 2004 final dividend of 34.5 million, which was paid on 12 May 2005, together with the 2005 interim dividend of 16.5 million paid on 21 October 2005.
