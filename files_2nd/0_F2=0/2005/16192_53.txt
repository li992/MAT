The Group earns a significant portion of its profits in the UK.

Furthermore, unsuccessful exploration expenditure is often incurred in jurisdictions where the Group has no taxable profits, such that no related tax benefit arises.
Accordingly the Groups tax charge will continue to depend on the jurisdictions in which pre-tax profits and exploration costs written off arise.
The Group has tax losses of 130 million 2004: 89.1 million that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group.

Earnings per Ordinary Share Basic earnings per ordinary share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued if employee and other share options were converted into ordinary shares.

The carrying amount of the Groups oil and gas assets includes an amount of 14,184,000 2004: 14,784,000 in respect of assets held under finance lease.
Other fixed assets include leasehold improvements, motor vehicles and office equipment.
Depletion and amortisation for oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the period plus production in the period, on a field-by-field basis.
Commercial reserves estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Commercial reserves estimates are based on a Group reserves report produced by an independent engineer.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.

Bank loans, overdrafts and guarantees are secured by fixed and floating charges over all the assets of the Group.
Wherever possible the Group conducts and manages its business in Sterling UK and US Dollars all other countries, the functional currencies of the industry in the areas in which it operates.
Balances are held in other currencies to meet immediate operating or administrative expenses or to comply with local currency regulations.
At 31 December 2005 the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were $177 million 102.9 million cash drawings under the US$850 million Borrowing Base Facility, a $15million 8.7 million Revolving Loan taken out in Ireland and funds in Pakistan of 364 million Pakistani Rupees 3.5 million in respect of sales income held awaiting the necessary approval for repatriation.
The US$177 million drawn under the Borrowing Base Facility at 31 December 2005 continues to be held as a hedge against US$ denominated net assets in subsidiaries.
Interest Rate Risk The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2005 was as follows: Stg Euro US$ Other Total 000 000 000 000 000 Cash at Bank at Floating Interest Rate 36,102 20,228 359 56,689 Cash at Bank on which no Interest is Received 194 50 5,330 3,123 8,697 Fixed Rate Debt 42,500 34,286 76,786 Floating Rate Debt 51,516 77,289 128,805 Net Debt Cash 57,720 50 86,017 3,482 140,205 The profile at 31 December 2004 for comparison purposes was as follows: Stg Euro US$ Other Total 000 000 000 000 000 Cash at Bank at Floating Interest Rate 74,207 242 7,148 265 81,862 Cash at Bank on which no Interest is Received 11 2 1,510 1,685 3,208 Fixed Rate Debt 4,375 4,375 Floating Rate Debt 47,675 100,172 147,847 Net Cash Debt 22,168 244 91,514 1,950 67,152 Cash at Bank at Floating Interest Rate consisted of deposits which earn interest at rates set in advance from periods ranging from overnight to one month by reference to Sterling or US Dollar LIBOR.
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined by US Dollar LIBOR and Sterling LIBOR.
Fixed rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance for period greater than three months or bank borrowings where the interest rate has been fixed through interest rate hedging.
Tullow Oil plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 59 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Note 16.
Financial Liabilities continued Interest Rate Risk continued In September 2005 the Group completed an $850 million refinancing exercise which consolidated existing borrowings into a single Borrowing Base Facility, which has created a more efficient Group financing structure and materially reduced the cash collaterisation of decommissioning Letters of Credit.
The Borrowing Base Facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at Sterling LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 110 basis points to 225 basis points depending on utilisation and concentration of non-OECD Assets and US Dollar LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 110 basis points to 225 basis points depending on utilisation and concentration of non-OECD Assets.
The outstanding debt is repayable in variable amounts determined semi-annually over the period to 31 August 2012, or such other time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
There is no requirement under the Borrowing Base Facility to hedge interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR and US Dollar LIBOR.
The Borrowing Base Facility states that consideration should be given to hedging at least 30% of the interest rate exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR for Sterling and US Dollars in respect of loans under the facility from time to time, net of relevant cash balances.
In the table for 2005, 76.8 million of the gross debt has been shown as fixed rate debt as the particular bank borrowings were fixed in November 2005 for a six month duration.
In December 2005, the Group executed an interest rate hedging programme effective February 2006, whereby 50% of the projected interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR and US Dollar LIBOR was hedged through the application of a series of interest rate swaps, options and zero cost collars.
The effect of these derivatives limits the interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR at 5.7% and US Dollar LIBOR at 5.8%.
The interest rate swaps, options and zero cost collars extend for a three year period for US Dollar and for an eighteen month period for Sterling LIBOR at varying notional principal amounts.
The interest rate swaps, options and zero cost collars do not give rise to material differences between book and fair values.
The hedged amounts are included in Floating Rate Debt in the above 2005 table as the interest rate hedging programme has an effective date of 24 February 2006.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Group holds a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts, with various counterparties, covering both its underlying oil and gas businesses.
In addition the Group holds a small portfolio of interest rate derivatives.
The Groups policy is to mitigate its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuation for a portion of its production, using a range of derivative financial instruments such as fixed price swaps, participating swaps, zero cost collars and other option structures.
The Groups policy is also to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in US Dollar and Sterling interest rates through the use of similar derivative financial instruments.
Fair Values of Derivative Instruments Under IAS 39 all derivatives must be recognised at fair value on the Balance Sheet with changes in fair value between accounting periods recognised in the Income Statement unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied.
The fair value is the amount for which the assets or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction at the relevant date.
Fair values are determined using quoted market prices where available.
To the extent that market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by reference to market-based transactions, or using standard valuation techniques for the applicable instruments and commodities involved.
The fair value of derivative instruments are recorded on the Balance Sheet under the caption Derivative Financial Instruments under Current Liabilities and Non Current Liabilities.
The Groups derivative instrument book and fair values were as follows: 31 Dec 1 Jan 2005 2005 000 000 Derivative Instruments Gas Derivatives 31,520 1,148 Oil Derivatives 116,344 40,658 Interest Rate Derivatives 17 11 147,847 39,521 Analysed as follows: Amounts Falling Due within One Year 70,639 12,645 Amounts Falling Due after One Year 77,208 26,876 147,847 39,521 60 Tullow Oil plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 A large portion of the derivative liabilities at 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2005 relate to contracts acquired as part of the acquisition of Energy Africa in May 2004: these contracts cover 4,000 bopd at a maximum Brent Dated price of $29.30 barrel extending to 31 December 2009.
These derivative liabilities are substantially offset by an increase in the economic value of the underlying hedged future oil production.
Cash Flow Hedges From 1 January 2005, the Groups commodity and interest rate derivatives were classified as cash flow hedges under IAS 39.
As a result, the effective portion of hedging gains or losses as a result of changes in the fair values of designated hedging instruments is deferred in a separate component of reserves subject to the establishment of a highly effective correlation defined in IAS 39 as hedge effectiveness within a range of 80 -125% between the commodity hedge and the underlying physical commoditys pricing and sale characteristics.
Such effective gains or losses are deferred to reserves and are recorded on the Balance Sheet under the caption Hedge Reserve see note 22.
Any change in the time value component of the hedge instrument is immediately recognised in the Income Statement under the caption Loss on Hedging Instruments.
The testing of hedge effectiveness is measured on an intrinsic basis.
Similar hedge effectiveness testing is carried out in relation to the Groups interest rate derivatives.
Hedge ineffectiveness arises when the hedge correlation results are within the range of 80-125% but not 100% precisely.
Hedge ineffectiveness is recognised directly in the income statement in the period, and such hedge ineffectiveness for the oil and gas commodity hedges is described below.
Hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in the income statement under the caption Loss on Hedging Instruments and the associated tax effect is recorded under the caption Income Tax Expense.
Oil Hedges The Group uses a number of derivative instruments to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with its underlying oil revenues.
These derivative instruments include fixed price swaps, participating swaps, zero cost collars and other option structures.
Such oil derivatives will tend to be priced using pricing benchmarks, such as Brent Dated, which correlate as far as possible to the underlying oil revenues.
The Group hedges its estimated oil revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its revenues from substantially all of its West African oil interests.
At 31 December 2005 the Groups oil hedge position was summarised as follows: Oil Hedges H1 2006 H2 2006 2007 2008 2009 Volume bopd 10,242 10,217 5,500 4,500 4,000 1 Average Price $ bbl 39.63 40.04 38.25 32.74 29.20 1 Average hedge prices are based on market prices as at 31 December 2005 and represent the current value of hedged volumes.
The Groups oil hedges have been assessed to be highly effective within the range prescribed under IAS39 using a regression analysis.
There is however a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups oil hedges arising from, among other factors, the discount on the Groups underlying West African crude relative to Brent and the timing of oil liftings relative to the hedges.
On this basis an unrealised loss of 100.1 million has been taken directly to equity, with an associated deferred tax credit of 5.6 million also being recorded on the Balance Sheet.
The element of hedge ineffectiveness and change in time value in relation to the oil hedges amounting to a loss of 2.6 million, with an associated tax charge of 0.7 million, have been recognised in the Income Statement in the current period.
A proportion of the oil cash flow hedges do not generate an offsetting tax charge or credit.
Gas Hedges The Group uses a number of derivative instruments to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with its underlying gas revenues.
These derivative instruments include fixed price swaps, participating swaps, zero costs collars and other option structures.
Such gas derivatives will tend to be priced using pricing benchmarks which correlate as far as possible to the underlying gas revenues.
The Group hedges its estimated gas revenues on a portfolio basis, aggregating its revenues from substantially all of its UK gas interests.
At 31 December 2005 the Groups gas hedge position was summarised as follows: Gas Hedges H1 2006 H2 2006 2007 2008 2009 Volume mmscfd 77 41 10 9 1 Average Price p therm 59.54 39.26 59.22 57.40 1 Average hedge prices are based on market prices as at 31 December 2005 and represent the current value of hedged volumes.
Tullow Oil plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 61 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Note 17.
Derivative Financial Investments continued Gas Hedges continued The Groups gas hedges have been assessed to be highly effective within the range prescribed under IAS39 using ratio analysis.
There is however a degree of ineffectiveness inherent in the Groups gas hedges arising from, among other factors, field production performance on any day.
On this basis an unrealised loss of 20.3 million has been taken directly to equity, with an associated deferred tax credit of 12.6 million also being recorded on the Balance Sheet.
A change in time value in relation to the gas hedges has resulted in a gain of 2.4 million, with an associated tax charge of 1.0 million, which have been recognised in the Income Statement in the current period.

These provisions have been created based on Tullows internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Assumptions, based on the current economic environment, have been made which management believes are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.

Share Based Payments Performance Share Plan PSP Under the PSP senior executives can receive conditional awards of rights over whole shares worth up to 150% of salary per annum.
Awards will vest under the PSP subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR based performance condition under which the Companys TSR performance will be measured over the fixed three year period against both the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts the Index and a comparator group of oil and gas companies.
Half of an award will be tested against the Index and the other half against the comparator group.
The test is over a three year period starting on the 1st January prior to grant, and an individual must normally remain in employment for three years from grant for the shares to vest.
No dividends are paid to participants over the vesting period.
Further details in relation to the PSP award measurements are provided in the Remuneration Report.
The shares outstanding under the PSP are as follows: PSP Shares Share price at grant Outstanding at 1 January 2005 Granted 1,784,417 187.5 Outstanding at 31 December 2005 1,784,417 187.5 The inputs of the option valuation model were: Risk free interest rate 4.1% p. a.
Expected volatility 33% Dividend yield 0.93% p. a.
The expected life is the period from grant to vesting date.
The weighted average fair value of the awards granted in 2005 was 112.8p per award.
The Company recognised a total expense of 311,000 2004: nil in respect of the PSP.
66 Tullow Oil plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The only share option scheme operated by the Company during the year was the 2000 ESOS.
Options granted under the 2000 ESOS normally only become exercisable following the third anniversary of the date of the grant if the performance condition has been met.
The awards are tested against the Index and 100% of awards will vest if the Companys TSR is above the median company of the Index over the three year period following grant.
Options awarded under the 2000 ESOS before 24 May 2005 are subject to monthly re-testing on a rolling three year basis if the TSR performance criterion is not met.
Options granted on or after 24 May 2005 are not subject to monthly re-testing.
Options have previously been granted under the 1988 ESOS and the 1998 ESOS.
Options granted under the 1988 ESOS and the 1998 ESOS are not subject to performance conditions.
All awards under the 1988 ESOS and the 1998 ESOS were made prior to 7 November 2002 and therefore, under the IFRS transitional provisions, they have not been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based Payments.

Tullow Oil plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 67 Notes to the Financial Statements continued UK & Irish Share Incentive Plans SIPs The SIPs were launched at the beginning of 2004.
These are all employee plans, which have been set up in both the UK and Ireland that enable employees to make contributions out of salary up to prescribed limits each month, which are used by the Plan trustees to acquire Tullow shares Partnership Shares.
The Company makes a matching contribution to the trustees to acquire a matching number of Tullow shares Matching Shares on a one-for-one basis.
The SIPs have a three month accumulation period.
The fair value of a Matching Share is the market value at grant adjusted for any options included.
For this purpose, the grant date is the start of the accumulation period.
For the UK plan, Partnership Shares are purchased at the lower of the market values at the start of the Accumulation Period and the purchase date.
For the Irish plan, shares are bought at the market price at the purchase date.
Matching shares vest three years after grant and dividends are paid to the employee during this period.
The Company recognised a total expense of 31,000 2004: 11,000 for the matching shares and 4,000 2004: nil for the partnership shares.

Subsequent Events Since the balance sheet date, Tullow has continued to develop its exploration, development and business growth strategies and has made a number of announcements in respect of drilling activity in Gabon, Uganda, Mauritania and the United Kingdom.
These included three unsuccessful wells, two wells that encountered hydrocarbons that require further analysis and a successful well in the CMS area.
The expected 2006 income statement impact of the unsuccessful wells is an exploration write off of 7 million.

Transition to IFRS For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2004, the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
These financial statements, for the year ended 31 December 2005, are the first the Group is required to prepare in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and the International Accounting Standards Board.
Accordingly, the Group has prepared financial statements which comply with IFRS applicable for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and the significant accounting policies adopted are shown above.
In preparing these financial statements, the Group has started from an opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2004, the Groups date of transition to IFRS, and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements required by IFRS 1 for the first time adoption of IFRS.
This note explains the principal adjustments made by the Group in restating its UK GAAP Balance Sheet as at 1 January 2004 and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The restatement of the Groups 2004 results under IFRS were published on the Tullow website www.
Exemptions applied IFRS 1 allows exemptions from the application of certain IFRS to assist companies with the transition process.
Accordingly the Group has made the following first time accounting policy choices: IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments is applied to all share-based rewards made after 7 November 2002 that did not vest before 1 January 2005 IFRS 3 Business Combinations prior to 1 January 2004 have not been restated IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement will be applied prospectively from 1 January 2005 and as such the 2004 restated information presented excludes adjustments required on adoption of these Standards The Group has availed of the early adoption of IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources with effect from 1 January 2004.
The Standard does not impact on the Groups existing policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure.
The adjustments to the 2004 UK GAAP financial statements can be explained as follows: IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments Tullow is committed to allowing employees the opportunity to participate in the ongoing growth and success of the Company and since 1988 has operated a variety of Share-based schemes including an Executive Share Option Scheme, a Performance Share Plan and Employee Share Incentive Plans.
Under UK GAAP no adjustment was made to the financial statements when options were granted as under the 1988, 1998 and 2000 Executive Share Option Schemes the options were granted at market value.
Adjustments were made to the financial statements only when the options were exercised.
IFRS 2 requires such share-based payments by the Group to employees to be fair valued at grant date using an option pricing model and charged through the income statement over the vesting period of the relevant awards.
The accounting change has reduced profit by 0.33 million in the year ended 31 December 2004.
Tullow Oil plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 69 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Note 31.
Transition to IFRS continued IAS 12 Income Taxes Business Combinations IAS 12 requires that deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising on acquisitions that are categorised as business combinations.
Business combinations are defined as the bringing together of separate entities or businesses into one reporting entity.
Deferred tax is recognised at acquisition as part of the assessment of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and is provided on balances previously excluded from provision under UK GAAP such as fair value revaluations of intangible and tangible fixed assets.
The acquisition of Energy Africa in May 2004, which is considered a business combination under IFRS 3 Business Combinations, gives rise to fair value adjustments.
Accordingly, the Group has recognised an additional deferred tax liability of 49.3 million in respect of these temporary differences as at 31 December 2004.
The fair values assigned to non-current assets were increased by a corresponding amount.
Any deferred tax provision will unwind through the consolidated income statement as the underlying temporary difference is reversed.
The net impact from the recognition of additional temporary differences on acquisitions is to increase profit after tax by 0.02 million for the year ended 31 December 2004.
IFRS 1 allows exemptions from the application of certain IFRS, and accordingly business combinations prior to 1 January 2004 have not been restated.
Similarly, the acquisition of the Schooner and Ketch fields completed in March 2005 is not classified as a business combination and accordingly there are no fair value adjustments to which this requirement of IAS 12 would apply.
Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT Under UK GAAP there is no definitive guidance on the accounting treatment for PRT.
Historically the Group has charged PRT due on chargeable field profits as a tax expense in the income statement.
In addition, deferred PRT was charged as a tax expense so as to allocate the expected PRT cost over the remaining life of the related field on a unit of production basis using commercial reserves.
The resulting asset or liability was included in the balance sheet under debtors or provisions as appropriate.
Tullows charges in respect of PRT arise from the Murdoch, Murdoch K and Orwell fields in the Southern North Sea.
Under IFRS, PRT is treated as an income tax under IAS 12 and deferred PRT accounted for on a temporary difference basis.
The effect of this revision is to more closely correlate the charge to PRT in any period to field profitability.
This has no impact on the economics of any asset or the total life of field PRT charge.
The overall PRT charge, net of deferred corporation tax, for the year ended 31 December 2004 has decreased by 3.3 million.
IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment Under UK GAAP the Group applied the successful efforts accounting policy which required all costs associated with unsuccessful exploration and pre-licence costs to be written off to the Profit and Loss Account.
This is consistent with IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources and so no adjustments are required.
Under UK GAAP the Groups oil and gas properties were depreciated with reference to the aggregate production and reserves of the fields of which they are considered to form a part the UOP method.
A field was defined, in accordance with the UK Statement of Recommended Practice SORP as an area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature and or stratigraphic condition.
Under IAS 16 each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item shall be depreciated separately.
Consequently certain fields and related infrastructure are required to be analysed into components and the related assets depreciated, using the UOP method over the reserves that the assets specifically serve.
This has particular implications for the depreciation of satellite fields and facilities that have a useful life materially different to that of the infrastructure through which they are produced.
Accordingly, an adjustment to depreciation has been made to reflect the useful life of the Gawain field and associated facilities on a standalone basis following a revised estimate of ultimate recoverable reserves during 2003.
The overall effect of this adjustment is to increase the depreciation charge, net of deferred tax, by 4.6 million in the year ended 31 December 2004.
70 Tullow Oil plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 IAS 17 Leases All leasing arrangements have been reviewed against the criteria of IAS 17 to determine whether the leases are operating or finance in nature.
Under UK GAAP a finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee.
A transfer of risks and rewards occurs if at the inception of a lease the present value of the minimum lease payments, including any initial payment, amounts to substantially all normally 90% or more of the fair value of the leased asset.
In Cote dIvoire the Espoir Field partners, including Tullow, have entered into an agreement covering the use of the Espoir Ivorienne FPSO until 2011.
While this arrangement did not fall to be treated as a finance lease under UK GAAP, IAS 17 imposes additional conditions which mean that the FPSO is classified as a finance lease by reference to the following specific criteria in IAS 17: at the inception of the lease the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset: and, the leased assets are of a specialised nature such that only the lessee can use them without major modifications being made.
Tullow also utilises an FPSO as part of its participation in the Ceiba field in Equatorial Guinea.
This vessel is not covered by either IAS 17 or SSAP 21 as it has been purchased by the Joint Venture partners.
Accordingly, at 31 December 2004, fixed assets with a net book value of 14.8 million have been recognised, together with 15.0 million of finance lease liabilities, of which 1.9 million has been classified as repayable within one year.
The income statement for the year has been restated as follows: a reduction in operating costs of 2.7 million as under UK GAAP operating lease payments were treated as a cost of sale: an increase in the depreciation charge of 2.2 million, reflecting the depreciation charge on the asset recognised under IFRS: and an increase in interest payable of 0.5 million, which reflects the interest element of the lease payments.
