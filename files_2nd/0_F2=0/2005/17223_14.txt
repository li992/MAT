The group has received approximately 80m in consideration for these divestments.
21 Pension liability group and company The group operates two pension schemes providing benets based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out at 1 April 2004 and 6 April 2004 and were updated for FRS 17 purposes for the periods to 30 January 2005 and 1 February 2004 by a qualied independent actuary.
It has been agreed that a joint employer employee contribution rate of 14168% of pensionable pay will apply in future years.
As these schemes are closed to new entrants, the current service cost as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.
Group and company The major assumptions used in this valuation were: 2005 2004 2003 Rate of increase in salaries 425525% 425525% 375475% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 300% 300% 250% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 525% 550% 575% Ination assumption 300% 300% 250% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

46 Wm MORRISON SUPERMARKETS PLC Notes on the financial statements continued 38 Financial instruments group The groups financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the groups operations.
Throughout the period under review, the group has not traded in financial instruments.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and a small amount of foreign currency risk.
Interest rate risk The group nances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings at variable and xed rates.
Liquidity risk The groups policy is that, to ensure continuity of funding, its borrowings are split between short-term overdraft facilities, deposits made overnight and longer term loans.
Short-term exibility is achieved using overdraft facilities.
Foreign currency risk The group has various subsidiaries overseas but due to their size there is no material currency risk.
Goods purchased in foreign currencies are paid for at the exchange rate ruling at the time of payment although from time to time this may be xed in advance by forward contract.
There continues to be a small amount of exports by the group but there is no material exchange rate risk associated with this.
Financial assets and liabilities The numerical disclosures below deal with financial assets and financial liabilities as dened in FRS13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments.
As permitted by FRS13, short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures, other than those relating to currency exposures.
Financial assets The group and the company hold the following investments in financial assets: Group Company 2005 2004 2005 2004 m m m m Cash at bank and in hand 204 88 119 89 Overnight deposits 731 859 01 789 Longer term deposits 2207 2000 1 1 1 1 93.5 3154 120 2878 9 9 9 9 In relation to cash balances held by group companies, there is a right of set-off where balances are held with the same bank.
Interest received on overnight and longer term deposits is calculated at the prevailing interest rate on the date of deposit.
Cash at bank and in hand represents cash in transit or amounts held at stores on which no interest is earned.
Cash, for the purpose of the cash ow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand.

The proceeds of the Euro bonds Euro 250 million had been swapped into xed rate Sterling on receipt in April 2000.
At period end, the weighted average interest rate of xed rate borrowings, after taking into account of interest rate swaps, was 63% 2004 nil%.
The weighted average period for which these borrowings are xed is 8 years 2004 nil.

48 Acquisitions On 8 March 2004, the group acquired the entire issued share capital of Safeway Limited formerly Safeway plc for a total consideration of 3,3463m, comprising 6652m cash and the issue of approximately 1,077m ordinary shares at a fair value of 2,6811m.
This acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
After the alignment of accounting policies and other adjustments to the valuation of assets and liabilities to reect their fair value, the provisional fair value of assets acquired is 3,6674m.
Negative goodwill of 3211m has therefore arisen, and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 10 has been shown adjacent to xed assets within the balance sheet.
This negative goodwill is being recognised in the profit and loss account in the periods in which the non-monetary assets to which it related are being recovered.
These are primarily the tangible xed assets acquired.
Exceptional costs amounting to 989m include acquisition, redundancy and reorganisation costs which are all associated with the acquisition and integration of the Safeway business.

Fair value is dened as the amount at which an asset or liability could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The reasons for the fair value adjustments above are as follows: Fixed assets have been valued to their open market value using external and internal valuations.
Investments have been valued at their open market value.
Stock has been written down to its net realisable value given its condition at the date of acquisition.
The bonds were restated to their fair value.
The provisions for liabilities adjustment was to recognise an onerous lease provision.
The deferred taxation adjustment is the tax effect of the fair value adjustments.
