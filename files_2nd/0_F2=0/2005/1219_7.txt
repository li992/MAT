Notes to the IFRS financial statements 1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies The business of the Group ARM Holdings plc and its subsidiary companies ARM or the Group design reduced instruction set computing RISC microprocessors, physical IP and related technology and software, and sell Development Systems, to enhance the performance, cost-effectiveness and powerefficiency of high-volume embedded applications.
The Group licences and sells its technology and products to leading international electronics companies, which in turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits ASIC and application-specific standard processors ASSP based on the Groups architecture to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products.
By creating a network of Partners, and working with them to best utilise the Groups technology, the Group is establishing its architecture as a RISC processor for use in many high-volume embedded microprocessor applications, including digital cellular phones, modems and automotive functions and for potential use in many growing markets, including smart cards and digital video.
The Group also licenses and sells Development Systems direct to systems companies and provides consulting and support services to its licensees, systems companies and other systems designers.
The Groups principal geographic markets are Europe, the US and Asia Pacific.
Incorporation and history ARM is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled under the laws of England and Wales.
The Company was formed on 16 October 1990, as a joint venture between Apple Computer UK Limited and Acorn Computers Limited, and operated under the name Advanced RISC Machines Holdings Limited until 10 March 1998, when its name was changed to ARM Holdings plc.
Its initial public offering was on 17 April 1998.

Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the EU, International Accounting Standards IAS and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale investments and derivative instruments.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Significant estimates in the financial statements include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, accounting for investments, provisions for income taxes, allowance for doubtful debts, impairment of non-current assets, goodwill and purchased intangible assets and contingencies and legal settlements.
Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries.
Intra-group transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated on consolidation.
All subsidiaries use uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events and similar circumstances.
Business combinations The results of subsidiaries acquired in the year are included in the income statement from the date they are acquired.
On acquisition, all of the subsidiaries assets and liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid on acquisition of a business over the fair value of the assets, including any intangible assets identified and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not amortised but is measured at cost less impairment losses.
In determining the fair value of consideration, the fair value of equity issued is the market value of equity at the date of completion, the fair value of share options assumed is calculated using the Black Scholes valuation model, and the fair value of contingent consideration is based upon whether the directors believe any performance conditions will be met and thus whether any further consideration will be payable.
As permitted by IFRS 1, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004 date of transition to IFRS has been frozen at the UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.
The Group performs its annual impairment review at the cash-generating unit level.
At the date of transition, and at the annual tests in 2004 and 2005, impairment tests showed there was no impairment with respect to goodwill.
Available-for-sale investments Publicly-traded investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at market value.
Unrealised holding gains or losses on such securities are included, net of related taxes, directly in equity via a revaluation reserve.
Impairment losses and realised gains and losses of such securities are reported in earnings.
Equity securities that are not publicly traded are recorded at fair value.
At 31 December 2005 and 2004, the estimated fair value of these investments approximated to cost less any permanent diminution in value, based on estimates determined by the directors.
The Group has applied the provisions of IAS 32, Financial Instruments: disclosure and presentation, and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement, from the date of transition to IFRS and has therefore not taken advantage of the optional exemption available under IFRS 1, under which the Group could have elected to apply these standards only from 1 January 2005.
Research and development expenditure All on-going research expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Where a product is technically feasible, production and sale are intended, a market exists, and sufficient resources are available to complete the project, development costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective product.
The Group believes its current process for developing products is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility which is evidenced by a working model.
Accordingly, development costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant and, therefore, no costs have been capitalised to date.
40 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Impairment charges The Group considers at each reporting date whether there is any indication that non-current assets are impaired.
If there is such an indication, the Group carries out an impairment test by measuring the assets recoverable amount, which is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and their value in use.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognised, and the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
"In addition, as discussed under ""Goodwill"" above, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually."
Revenue recognition The Group follows the principles of IAS 18, Revenue recognition, in determining appropriate revenue recognition policies.
In principle, therefore, revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group.
Revenue excluding VAT comprises the value of sales of licences, royalties arising from the resulting sale of licensees ARM-based products, revenues from support, maintenance and training, consulting contracts and the sale of boards and software toolkits.
Revenue from standard licence products which are not modified to meet the specific requirements of each customer is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of the product are transferred to the customer.
Many licence agreements are for products which are designed to meet the specific requirements of each customer.
Revenue from the sale of such licences is recognised on a  basis over the period from signing of the licence to customer acceptance.
Under the  method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognised in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined.
The percentage of completion is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project compared with the total estimated project requirement, which approximates to the extent of performance.
Where invoicing milestones on licence arrangements are such that the receipts fall due significantly outside the period over which the customisation is expected to be performed or significantly outside its normal payment terms for standard licence arrangements, the Group evaluates whether it is probable that economic benefits associated with these milestones will flow to the Group and therefore whether these receipts should initially be included in the arrangement consideration.
In particular, it considers: whether there is sufficient certainty that the invoice will be raised in the expected timeframe, particularly where the invoicing milestone is in some way dependent on customer activity: whether it has sufficient evidence that the customer considers that the Groups contractual obligations have been, or will be, fulfilled: whether there is sufficient certainty that only those costs budgeted to be incurred will indeed be incurred before the customer will accept that a future invoice may be raised: and the extent to which previous experience with similar product groups and similar customers support the conclusions reached.
Where the Group considers that there is insufficient evidence that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with such future milestones will flow to the Group, taking into account these criteria, such milestones are excluded from the arrangement consideration until there is sufficient evidence that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group.
The Group does not discount future invoicing milestones, as the effect of so doing would be immaterial.
If the amount of revenue recognised exceeds the amounts invoiced to customers, the excess amount is recorded as amounts recoverable on contracts within debtors.
Where agreements involve several components, the entire fee from such arrangements has been allocated to each of the individual components based on each components fair value.
Vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value is determined by reference to licence agreements with other customers where components are sold separately.
Agreements including rights to unspecified products are accounted for using subscription accounting, revenue from the arrangement being recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement, or an estimate of the economic life of the products offered, beginning with the delivery of the first product.
Certain products have been co-developed by the Group and a collaborative partner, with both parties retaining the right to sell licences to the product.
In those cases where the Group makes sales of these products and is exposed to the significant risks and benefits associated with the transaction, the total value of the licence is recorded as revenue and the amount payable to the collaborative partner is recorded as cost of sales.
Where the collaborative partner makes sales of these products, the Group records as revenue the commission it is due when informed by the collaborative partner that a sale has been made and cash has been collected.
In addition to the licence fees, contracts generally contain an agreement to provide post-contract support support, maintenance and training PCS which consists of an identified customer contact at the Group and telephonic or e-mail support.
Fees for PCS which take place after customer acceptance are specified in the contract.
Revenue related to PCS is recognised based on VSOE, which is determined with reference to contractual renewal rates, or, if none are specified, by reference to the rates actually charged on renewal PCS arrangements for the same level of support and for the same or similar technologies.
Revenue for PCS is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period for which support and maintenance is contractually agreed by the Company with the licensee.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 41 Notes to the IFRS financial statements continued 1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued The excess of licence fees and post-contract support invoiced over revenue recognised is recorded as deferred revenue.
Sales of software, including development systems, which are not specifically designed for a given licence such as off-the-shelf software are recognised upon delivery, when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer.
At that time, the Group has no further obligations except that, where necessary, the costs associated with providing post-contract support have been accrued.
Services such as training that the Group provides which are not essential to the functionality of the IP are separately stated and priced in the contract and, therefore, accounted for separately.
Revenue is recognised as services are performed and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group.
Royalty revenues are earned on sales by the Companys customers of products containing ARM technology.
Revenues are recognised when ARM receives notification from the customer of product sales, or receives payment of any fixed royalties, normally quarterly in arrears.
Revenue from consulting is recognised when the service has been provided and all obligations to the customer under the consulting agreement have been fulfilled.
For larger consulting projects containing several project milestones, revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis as milestones are achieved.
Consulting costs are recognised when incurred.
As disclosed above, in accordance with IAS 8, Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, the Group makes significant estimates in applying its revenue recognition policies.
In particular, as discussed in detail above, estimates are made in relation to the use of the  accounting method, which requires that the extent of progress toward completion of contracts may be anticipated with reasonable certainty.
The use of the  method is itself based on the assumption that, at the outset of licence agreements, customer acceptance is not uncertain.
The Group also makes assessments, based on prior experience, of the extent to which future milestone receipts represent a probable future economic benefit to the Group.
In addition, when allocating revenue to various components of arrangements involving several components, it is assumed that the fair value of each element is reflected by its price when sold separately.
The complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the revenue recognition policies affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
If different assumptions were used, it is possible that different amounts would be reported in the financial statements.
Government grants Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are credited to research and development costs within the income statement to match the projects related expenditure.
Retirement benefit costs The Group contributes to defined contribution plans substantially covering all employees in Europe and the US and to government pension schemes for employees in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, PR China, Israel and India.
The Group contributes to these plans based upon various fixed percentages of employee compensation, and such contributions are expensed as incurred.
Cash and cash equivalents The Group considers all highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Short-term investments and marketable securities The Group considers all highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of greater than three months but less than one year to be either short-term investments or short-term marketable securities.
Any investments with a maturity date of greater than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as long term.
Allowance for doubtful debts Trade receivables are first assessed individually for impairment, or collectively where the receivables are not individually significant.
Where there is no objective evidence of impairment for an individual receivable, it is included in a group of receivables with similar credit risk characteristics and these are collectively assessed for impairment.
Movements in the provision for doubtful debts are recorded in the income statement.
Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In general, cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis and includes transport and handling costs.
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory.
Property, plant and equipment The cost of property and equipment is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
External costs and internal costs are capitalised to the extent they enhance the future economic benefit of the asset.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less their estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
The principal economic lives used for this purpose are: Freehold buildings 25 years Leasehold improvements Five years or term of lease, whichever is shorter Computers Three to five years Fixtures and fittings Five to ten years Motor vehicles Four years Provision is made against the carrying value of property, plant and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Asset lives and residual values are reviewed on an annual basis.
Acquired intangible assets Computer software, purchased patents and licences to use technology are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over a prudent estimate of the time that the Group is expected to benefit from them, which is typically three to five years.
Costs that are directly attributable to the development of new business application software and which are incurred during the period prior to the date that the software is placed into operational use, are capitalised.
42 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Although an independent valuation is made of any intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination, the directors are primarily responsible for determining the fair value of intangible assets.
Developed technology, existing agreements and customer relationships, core technology, trademarks and tradenames, and order backlog are capitalised and amortised over a period of one to six years, being a prudent estimate of the time that the Group is expected to benefit from them.
In-process research and development projects purchased as part of a business combination may meet the criteria set out in IFRS 3, Business combinations, for recognition as intangible assets other than goodwill.
The directors track the status of in-process research and development intangible assets such that their amortisation commences when the assets are brought into use.
This typically means a write-off period of one to five years.
Amortisation is calculated so as to write off the cost of intangible assets, less their estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
The principal economic lives used for this purpose are: Computer software Three to five years Patents and licences Three to five years In-process research and development One to five years Developed technology One to five years Existing agreements and customer relationships Two to six years Core technology Five years Trademarks and tradenames Four to five years Order backlog One year Provision is made against the carrying value of acquired intangible assets where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term even if payments are not made on such a basis.
Currency translation The functional currency of each Group entity is the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the presentation currency of the Group.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into the functional currency of each Group entity at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Such exchange differences have been included in general and administrative costs.
The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income statements of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the period.
Translation differences are taken directly to equity via the cumulative translation adjustment.
On disposal of a subsidiary such amounts are recycled to the income statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the balance on the cumulative translation adjustment on retranslation of subsidiaries net assets has been set to zero at the date of transition to IFRS.
Derivative financial instruments The Group utilises currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk on actual transactions related to accounts receivable, denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the business.
The Groups currency exchange contracts do not subject the Group to risk from exchange rate movements because the gains and losses on such contracts offset losses and gains, respectively, on the transactions being hedged.
The currency exchange contracts and related accounts receivable are recorded at fair value at each period end.
Fair value is estimated using the settlement rates prevailing at the period end.
All recognised gains and losses resulting from the settlement of the contracts are recorded within general and administrative costs in the income statement.
The Group does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging anticipated transactions.
Embedded derivatives From time to time, the Group enters into sales contracts denominated in a currency typically US dollars that is neither the functional currency of the Group nor the functional currency of the customer.
Where there are uninvoiced amounts on such contracts, the Group carries such derivatives at fair value.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement under general and administrative costs.
Income taxes Income taxes are computed using the liability method.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
The deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the asset will not be realised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities arising in the same tax jurisdiction are off-set.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 43 Notes to the IFRS financial statements continued 1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued In the UK and the US, the Group is entitled to a tax deduction for amounts treated as compensation on exercise of certain employee share options under each jurisdictions tax rules.
As explained under share-based payments below, a compensation expense is recorded in the Groups income statement over the period from the grant date to the vesting date of the relevant options.
As there is a temporary difference between the accounting and tax bases, a deferred tax asset is recorded.
The deferred tax asset arising is calculated by comparing the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future based on the Groups share price at the balance sheet date with the cumulative amount of the compensation expense recorded in the income statement.
If the amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, against retained earnings.
As explained under share-based payments below, no compensation charge is recorded in respect of options granted before 7 November 2002 or in respect of those options which have been exercised or have lapsed before 1 January 2005.
Nevertheless, tax deductions have arisen and will continue to arise on these options.
The tax effects arising in relation to these options are recorded directly in equity, against retained earnings.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding treasury stock and those shares held in the ESOP and the QUEST which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The diluted share base for the year ended 31 December 2005 excludes incremental shares of approximately 39,614,000 2004: 38,143,000 related to employee stock options.
These shares are excluded due to their anti-dilutive effect as a result of the exercise price of these shares being higher than the market price.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
In accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based payments, equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The Group operates Save As You Earn SAYE schemes in the UK and an Employee Share Purchase Plan ESPP in the US.
Options under these schemes are granted at a 15% discount to market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant.
The UK SAYE schemes are approved by the Inland Revenue, which stipulates that the saving period must be at least 36 months.
The Group has recognised a compensation charge in respect of the UK SAYE plans and US ESPPs.
The charges for these are calculated as detailed above.
The Group also has an LTIP on which it is also required to recognise a compensation charge under IFRS 2, calculated as detailed above.
The Group has applied the exemption available, and has applied the provisions of IFRS 2 only to those options granted after 7 November 2002 and which were outstanding at 31 December 2004.
The share-based payments charge is allocated to cost of sales, research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative on the basis of headcount.
Employers taxes on share options Employers National Insurance in the UK and equivalent taxes in other jurisdictions are payable on the exercise of certain share options.
In accordance with IFRS 2, this is treated as a cash-settled transaction.
A provision is made, calculated using the fair value of the Groups shares at the balance sheet date, pro-rated over the vesting period of the options.
Employee share ownership plans The Companys Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP and Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST are separately administered trusts which are funded by loans the ESOP and loans and gifts the QUEST from the Company, and the assets of which comprise shares in the Company.
The Company recognises the assets and liabilities of the ESOP and the QUEST in its own accounts and shares held by the trusts are recorded at cost as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds until such time as the shares vest conditionally to employees.
Investment income Investment income relates to interest income, which is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Dividends payable Distributions to equity holders are not recognised in the income statement under IFRS, but are disclosed as a component of the movement in shareholders equity.
A liability is recorded for a dividend when the dividend is approved by the Companys shareholders.
Provisions Provisions for restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Segmental reporting The primary reporting format is based on business segments, comprising the Processor Division and the Physical IP Division.
The secondary reporting format is based on geographical segments, these being Europe, the US and Asia Pacific.
The primary reporting format requires segmentation of the Groups revenue and result before investment income and tax.
Segment expenses are expenses that are directly attributable to a segment together with the relevant portion of other expenses that can reasonably be attached to the segment.
Investment income and tax are not segmented.
44 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Forthcoming accounting standards At the date of approval of these financial statements the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: an amendment to IAS 21 in respect of an entity's investment in foreign operations: an amendment to IAS 1 requiring new disclosures about entities management of their capital resources: amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 which clarify whether financial guarantees fall within the scope of IAS 39 or IFRS 4 and stipulate the measurement method to be applied to such guarantees: an amendment to IAS 39 restricting the use of the option to designate a financial asset or financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss: an amendment to IAS 39 to permit hedge accounting for certain forecast intra-Group transactions: and a new accounting standard, IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures.
This standard replaces IAS 30 and the disclosure requirements in IAS 32 and locates in one place all disclosures relating to financial instruments.
The new requirements incorporate many of IAS 32s disclosures as well as additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures on the risks arising from financial instruments.
The directors acknowledge the adoption of these standards and interpretations in the future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements when they come into effect for periods after 1 January 2006.
2 Segmental reporting At 31 December 2005 and 2004, the Group is organised on a worldwide basis into two business segments: Processor Division Physical IP Division There are no sales between the business segments.
Unallocated costs represent corporate expenses.
Segment assets include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, inventories, receivables and operating cash and exclude deferred tax assets.
Segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities and exclude current and deferred tax.
Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets, including additions resulting from acquisitions through business combinations.

The amount of deferred tax assets unrecognised at 31 December 2005 was 366,000 2004: 254,000.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
If the earnings were remitted, tax of 2,379,000 would be payable.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities prior to offsetting of balances within the same tax jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12 during the year are shown below.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforcable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

It will be paid on 5 May 2006 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 31 March 2006.
9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the ESOP, the QUEST and treasury stock which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Company had two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares during the year: those being share options granted to employees and directors where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
For 2005 and 2004, no shares that were allocated for awards under the LTIP were included in the diluted EPS calculation as the performance criteria could not be measured until the conclusion of the performance period.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are shown on the face of the income statement.

The carrying amounts of goodwill by cash generating unit CGU are summarised in the following schedule on a segment level: Processors Physical IP Group 000 000 000 Goodwill relating to Artisan 114,840 344,519 459,359 Goodwill relating to other acquisitions 15,071 15,071 129,911 344,519 474,430 The recoverable amount for each CGU has been measured based on a value in use calculation.
Processor Division PD The Processor Division encompasses the whole of the business excluding Physical IP.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were: Period over which the directors have projected cash flows A ten-year forecast period is used with an assumed terminal growth rate after 2015 of 3% per annum.
It is considered appropriate to use a ten-year forecast period to properly reflect the period over which the benefits of the acquisition of Artisan to the Processor Division are expected to accrue.
It is expected that it will take between four and seven years before the majority of ARMs larger semiconductor partners are licensing physical IP from the Group, with royalties being generated from these licences a further two to four years later, i. e. a total period of six to 11 years.
Forecast revenue growth Revenue is forecast to grow by an amount consistent with the Group's five-year plan as well as analysts expectations.
These have proved to be reliable guides in the past and the directors believe that these estimates are appropriate.
Revenue attributable to the benefits afforded by owning the PIPD unit The directors believe that revenue will accrue to the Processor Division as a result of the ownership of the Physical IP Division for the following reasons: the development of faster and more power-efficient microprocessors as a result of collaboration between PD and PIPD engineering teams.
This is expected to generate more PD licensing deals at higher prices: the potential for PD to win more microprocessor licensing business as a result of ARM being able to offer both processor and physical IP in-house: and the improvement in PD operating margins as a result of being able to transfer a number of engineering tasks to the Bangalore design centre acquired with Artisan.
Operating margins Operating margins have been assumed to remain consistent with current operating margins over the period of the calculation.
Discount rate Future cash flows are discounted in line with ARMs estimated weighted average cost of capital of approximately 9.5% pre-tax.
The directors are confident that the amount of goodwill allocated to the Processor Division is appropriate and that the assumptions used in estimating its fair value are appropriate.
Whilst it is conceivable that a key assumption in the calculation could change, the directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes to key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value.
56 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 16 Goodwill continued Physical IP Division PIPD The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were: Period over which the directors have projected cash flows A ten-year forecast period is used with an assumed terminal growth rate after 2015 of 3% per annum.
It is considered appropriate to use a ten-year forecast period to properly reflect the period over which the benefits of the acquisition of Artisan are expected to accrue.
Forecast revenue growth Revenue is forecast to grow by approximately 20% in the first five years, falling to 6% by 2015 to reflect the uncertainty of forecasting revenues in the years further in the future.
In assessing the appropriate valuation of PIPD in 2004, the directors assumed revenue growth of approximately 20% per annum was achievable in the PIPD stand-alone business based on process geometry shrinks bringing more licensing opportunities across a broader range of foundries and based on the significant increase in the usage of Artisan IP in 2003 and 2004 which is yet to generate royalties.
Confidence in achieving revenue growth of 20% is underpinned by the expected increasing contribution from synergistic revenues in addition to the growth potential in the stand-alone business.
In 2005 licence revenues still grew by 21%.
Like-for-like royalty revenue growth was only 1% but was materially impacted by industry macro factors and changes to internal processes.
Operating margins Operating margins are assumed to increase from 32% in 2006 with growth up to margins in the mid-40s% by 2010.
In 2005, PIPD operating margin was 30%.
This is expected to increase in future years as royalty growth gathers pace at effectively 100% margins.
Costs are expected to grow broadly in line with licence revenue growth.
This timescale is consistent with ARMs experience in developing the processor licensing and royalty model.
ARM has signed approximately 370 processor licences over the last 15 years with less than half of these yielding royalties thus far.
As royalty revenues are a function of cumulative licensing, royalty growth gathers momentum as the licensing base grows ARM processor royalties have increased from $38 million in 2002 to $131 million in 2005.
Discount rate Future cash flows are discounted in line with estimated weighted average cost of capital for the Physical IP business of approximately 10% pre-tax.
The directors are confident that the amount of goodwill allocated to the Physical IP Division is appropriate and that the assumptions used in estimating its fair value are appropriate.

20 Other non-current liabilities 2005 2004 000 000 Accruals and deferred income 1,732 58 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 21 Financial instruments Financial risk factors The Group's operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and price risk.
The Group has no derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate fluctuations in place at the year end since it has no loan financing, and as such no hedge accounting is applied.
Given the size of the Group, the directors have not delegated the responsibility of monitoring financial risk management to a sub-committee of the board.
The policies set by the board of directors are implemented by the Group's finance department.
The department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and price risk and circumstances where it would be appropriate to use financial instruments to manage these.
Currency risk The Groups earnings and liquidity are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally in respect of the US dollar, reflecting the fact that most of its revenues and cash receipts are denominated in US dollars, while a significant proportion of its costs are settled in sterling the proportion of US dollar denominated costs for the Group going forward after the acquisition of Artisan increased from approximately 25% to approximately 45%.
The Group seeks to use forward contracts and currency options to manage the US dollar sterling risk as appropriate, by monitoring the timing and value of anticipated US dollar receipts which tend to arise from low-volume, high-value licence deals and royalty receipts in comparison with its requirement to settle certain expenses in US dollars.
The Group reviews the resulting exposure on a regular basis and hedges this exposure using forward contracts and currency options for the sale of US dollars as appropriate.
Such contracts are entered into with the objective of matching their maturity with projected US dollar cash receipts.
As the timing of large cash receipts cannot be predicted with certainty, the Group enters into forward contracts which allow exercise between two dates, typically between three and four months from the invoice date.
In those cases where customers settle debts before the expiry of the foreign exchange contract, the Group evaluates whether money market rates available for US dollar investments exceed those for sterling investments.
It then seeks to maximise its returns by remitting US dollars against forward contracts at the beginning or end of the exercise period, depending on the prevailing money market rates for US dollars and sterling at the time.
At 31 December 2005, the Group had outstanding forward contracts to sell $36,000,000 2004: $50,000,000 and potential exercisable currency options of $76,000,000 2004: $nil.
The Group had $59,987,000 2004: $56,205,000 of accounts receivable denominated in US dollars at that date, and US dollar cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities balances of $121,427,000 2004: $176,464,000.
Thus 38% 2004: 79% of the Groups US dollar current assets were not hedged by matching forward contracts and currency options at the year end.
The Group does not qualify for hedge accounting, and all movements in the fair value of derivative foreign exchange instruments are recorded in the income statement, offsetting the foreign exchange movements on the accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents being hedged.
In addition, certain customers remit royalties and licence fees in other currencies, primarily the euro.
The Group is also required to settle certain expenses in euros, primarily in its French, Belgian and German subsidiaries, and as the net amounts involved are not considered significant, the Group does not take out euro forward contracts.
Interest rate risk At 31 December 2005, the Group has 160,902,000 2004: 142,817,000 of interest-bearing assets.
At 31 December 2005, 77% 2004: 45% of interest-bearing assets were at fixed rates.
Floating rate cash earns interest based on relevant national LIBID equivalent.
The proportion of funds held in fixed rather than floating-rate deposits is determined in accordance with the liquidity risk policy below.
Price risk The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk on available-for-sale investments.
As there can be no guarantee that there will be a future market for securities which are generally unlisted at the time of the investment or that the value of such investments will rise, the directors evaluate each investment opportunity on its merits before committing ARMs funds.
The directors review holdings in such companies on a regular basis to determine whether continued investment is in the best interests of the Group.
Funds for such ventures are strictly limited in order that the financial effect of any potential decline of the value of investments will not be substantial in the context of the Groups financial results.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
Financial instrument counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the board of directors and such approval is limited to financial institutions with an AAA rating.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit, which is reassessed annually by the board.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to maintain balances of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term marketable securities, such that highly liquid resources at all times exceeds the projected cash outflows of the business.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 59 Notes to the IFRS financial statements continued 21 Financial instruments continued Use of financial instuments External borrowings At 31 December 2005, the Group owed nil 2004: $3.3 million or 1,732,000 extending beyond one year from the balance sheet date being the final payment of a technology licence agreement signed in 2004.
The Group had no undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December 2005 2004: nil or during the financial year.
Numerical disclosures Numerical disclosures are set out in the tables below.
These balances are as of 31 December in each year.

Short-term marketable securities There is a readily available market for these investments.
Unrealised gains and losses on these investments are recognised directly as equity via the revaluation reserve.
The Group recognises an impairment charge when the decline in fair value below cost is judged to be other than temporary.
At 31 December 2005, the fair value is 30,000 less than cost with a corresponding amount being charged to equity as the decline is judged to be temporary.
Fair value of currency exchange contracts The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is estimated using the settlement rates.
The estimation of the fair value of the liability in respect of forward contracts is 1,708,000 at 31 December 2005 2004: asset of 1,674,000.
The decrease is due to the value and relative exchange rates of contracts outstanding compared to 2004.
The resulting gain or loss on the movement of the fair value of currency exchange contracts is recognised in the income statement under general and administrative costs as shown below.
2005 2004 000 000 Loss in income statement 3,382 341 Long-term marketable securities There is a readily available market for these investments.
Unrealised gains and losses on these investments are recognised directly in equity via the revaluation reserve.
At 31 December 2005, the fair value approximates to carrying value.
Available-for-sale investments: investments in unlisted companies Those companies in which ARM has invested are early-stage development enterprises, which are generating value for shareholders through research and development activities, and most do not currently report profits.
The directors do not consider it possible to estimate with precision the fair value of the Groups investments in unlisted companies carrying value at 31 December 2005: 1,805,000 as they are, by definition, not traded on an organised market and are unique in their activities.
However, based on recent fundraising transactions by these companies and, where possible, following review of relevant financial information prepared by the companies, the directors are of the opinion that the fair value of these investments approximates to carrying value.
Available-for-sale investments: investments in listed companies The fair value of listed investments is determined with reference to prices quoted on the London Stock Exchange at 31 December 2005.
On this basis, the fair value of the Groups listed investments was 6,995,000 at 31 December 2005 2004: 10,262,000.
"Embedded derivatives In accordance with IAS 39, ""Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement"", the Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set out in the standard."
From time to time, the Group enters into sales contracts denominated in a currency typically US dollars that is neither the functional currency of the Group nor the functional currency of the customer.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement under general and administrative costs, as shown below: 2005 2004 000 000 Gain loss in income statement 2,101 732 60 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 21 Financial instruments continued Hedge of net investment in foreign entity The Group, where required, invests profits in the subsidiary in which they were earned.
The Group does not hedge any foreign net asset investment using foreign currency loans, as there is currently no requirement for external borrowings.

Included within this category in 2004 is an amount of 1,732,000 which is classified as non-current.
This approximates to fair value and matures in 2006.
Trade and other receivables The carrying amount approximates to fair value as this is the amount which would be receivable if the asset had crystallised at the balance sheet date.
Cash and cash-equivalents The carrying amount approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments, being no greater than three months.
Short-term investments The carrying amount approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments, being greater than three months but less than one year.
Financial instruments held for trading purposes The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
These shares have a nominal value of 0.05 pence and represent 1% of called-up share capital at 31 December 2005.
24 Acquisitions On 27 October 2005, the Group purchased the entire share capital of Keil Elektronik GmbH KEG, a leading provider of software development tools for the microcontroller market MCU and incorporated in Germany for total consideration of 7.4 million.
On the same day, the Group purchased the entire share capital of Keil Software Inc. KSI, also a leading provider of software development tools for the MCU market and incorporated in the US for total consideration of 3.5 million.
These purchases have been accounted for as acquisitions.
The Group has identified the MCU market as a critical growth area for the Groups future business and with this acquisition, the Group will be able to accelerate progress in that market by offering a more complete solution.
As the MCU applications shift from 8 16-bit to 32-bit solutions, the combination of the ARM Cortex-M3 processor, which was specifically designed for microcontroller applications, the RealView high-performance compiler and Keils complementary MCU tools for ARM, will enable new generations of ARM MCU solutions.
For the reasons given above, the Group paid a premium on both the Keil acquisitions, giving rise to goodwill.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2005 the acquisitions contributed 0.9 million to revenue, and 0.6 million to both profit before interest and profit before tax.
The acquisition did not make a material contribution to the Groups post-acquisition net operating cash flows, tax paid or capital expenditure.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
The accounting for the Keil acquisitions has been determined on a provisional basis at 31 December 2005 because the fair values assigned to the acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities have been determined only provisionally.
Any adjustments to these provisional values as a result of completing work on the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired will be recognised within 12 months of the acquisition date and will be recognised as if they had occurred as at the date of acquisition.

The contingent consideration will be determined based on KEGs future revenue in the first two years post-acquisition.
62 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 24 Acquisitions continued The outflow of cash and cash equivalents on the acquisition of KEG is calculated as follows: 000 Cash consideration paid 4,397 Expenses paid 263 Cash acquired 2,911 Net cash outflow 1,749 The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of KEG can be analysed as follows: 000 Developed technology 2,744 Customer relationships 4,290 Total 7,034 The methods and significant assumptions involved in valuing these identifiable intangible assets are described below: Developed technology Technology of 2.7 million related to software development tools for the microcontroller market, consisting of 8-, 16- and 32-bit technology.
At the date of acquisition, the technology was complete and had reached technological feasibility.
Any costs incurred in the future will relate to the ongoing maintenance of the technology and will be expensed as incurred.
To estimate the fair value of technology, the relief from royalty method within an income approach was used with a post-tax discount rate of 11%, with a specific surcharge of 5% for both the 8- and 16-bit technology and 3.4% for the 32-bit techology.
To derive the royalty cash flows, the revenues from each identified technology were used.
All technologies are being amortised over an estimated useful life of one to five years.
Customer relationships The customer base of 4.3 million represented the fair value of existing customer relationships and contracts.
These have been divided into different customer groups: direct company customers and dealers.
To estimate the fair value of the customer base, the multi-period excess earnings method has been applied, with the valuation based on the planned free cash flows resulting from existing customer relationships as of the valuation date.
Direct company customers and dealers are being amortised over their estimated useful lives of two and three years respectively.
KEG made a profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 1.0 million and for the period from 1 January 2005 until acquisition a profit after tax of 1.0 million.
The results of the Group would not have been significantly different had the acquisition of KEG occurred on 1 January 2005.

The contingent consideration will be determined based on KSIs future revenue in the first two years post-acquisition.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 63 Notes to the IFRS financial statements continued 24 Acquisitions continued The outflow of cash and cash equivalents on the acquisition of KSI is calculated as follows: 000 Cash consideration paid 2,415 Expenses paid 132 Cash acquired 32 Net cash outflow 2,515 The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of KSI can be analysed as follows: 000 Customer relationships 482 Tradenames 1,175 Total 1,657 The methods and significant assumptions involved in valuing these identifiable intangible assets are described below: Tradenames Tradenames of 1.2 million represented the trade names and internet domain names legally held by Keil Software, Inc. To estimate the fair value of these tradenames, the relief from royalty method within an income approach was applied with a post-tax discount rate of 14.5%.
To derive the royalty cash flows, the revenues from Keil Software Inc. and Keil Elektronik GmbH were used.
All tradenames are being amortised over an estimated useful life of five years.
Customer relationships The customer base of 0.5 million represented the fair value of existing customer relationships and contracts, these have been divided into different customer groups: direct customers and distributors.
Direct company customers and distributors are being amortised over their estimated useful lives of two and three years respectively.
KSI made a loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 95,000 and for the period from 1 January 2005 until acquisition a loss after tax of 40,000.
The results of the Group would not have been significantly different had the acquisition of KSI occured on 1 January 2005.
Artisan Components Inc. acquisition On 23 December 2004, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Artisan Components Inc. a leading provider of physical IP components for the design and manufacture of complex system-on-chip SoC integrated circuits, for total consideration of 546.6 million.
This purchase was accounted for as an acquisition.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2004, Artisan contributed 195,000 to revenue, decreased profit before interest by 653,000 and decreased profit before tax by 599,000.

The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Artisan Components Inc. can be analysed as follows: 000 Computer software 697 In-process research and development 3,542 Developed technology 17,240 Core technology 12,031 Existing agreements and customer relationships 37,292 Order backlog 1,667 Trademarks 2,604 Total 75,073 The methods and significant assumptions involved in valuing these identifiable intangible assets are described below: In-process research and development In-process research and development of 3.5 million reflected certain research projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and commercial viability.
The fair value assigned to in-process research and development was estimated using the income approach, which discounts to present value the cash flows attributable to the technology once it has reached technological feasibility using a post-tax discount rate of 18%.
Developed technology and core technology Developed technology of 17.2 million and patents and core technology of 12.0 million included intellectual property components for use in SoC integrated circuits and consisted of the following: embedded memory, standard cell, input output components, and analogue and mixed-signal products.
In addition, developed technology included a combination of processes, patents, patent applications, core modular architecture and trade secrets that are the buildings blocks of the technology.
At the date of acquisition, the developed technology was complete and had reached technological feasibility.
Any costs incurred in the future will relate to the ongoing maintenance of the developed technology and will be expensed as incurred.
To estimate the fair value of the developed technology, an income approach was used with a post-tax discount rate of 13% for existing technology and 15% for patents and core technology, which included an analysis of future cash flows and the risks associated with achieving such cash flows.
All developed technologies are being amortised over the estimated useful lives of four to five years.
Existing agreements and customer relationships and order backlog The customer base of 37.3 million and order backlog of 1.7 million represented the fair value of existing customer relationships and contracts, royalty arrangements, and support and maintenance agreements.
To estimate the fair value of the customer base and order backlog, a cost approach replacement value was used.
The customer base and order backlog are being amortised over their estimated useful lives of three to six years for customer base and one year for order backlog.
Trademarks The fair value assigned to trademarks, including the company name Artisan, was estimated to be 2.6 million.
This was calculated using the income approach, which discounts the present value of attributable cash flows at a post-tax discount rate of 15%.
The results of the operation in 2004, as if the above acquisition had been made at the beginning of the period are as follows: 000 Revenue 197,852 Profit 15,449 The pro forma consolidated results of operations include adjustments to give effect to amortisation of acquired intangible assets other than goodwill, reduced investment income as a result of the cash portion of the acquisition consideration, amortisation of deferred compensation and the related income tax effects.
This information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the purchase been made at the beginning of the period presented or the future results of the combined operations.

66 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 25 Share-based payments The Group has several share option schemes in current operation, whereby options over shares in the Company can be granted to employees and directors.
The different schemes are described below, but all options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant, except for those options within the SAYE schemes which are issued at a 15% discount.
Under the UK Inland Revenue Executive Approved Share Option Plan the Executive Scheme, the Company may grant options to employees meeting certain eligibility requirements.
Options under the Executive Scheme are exercisable between three and ten years after their issue, after which time the options expire.
Under the Companys Unapproved Scheme the Unapproved Scheme, for which it has not sought approval from the UK Inland Revenue, options are exercisable one to seven years after their issue, after which time the options expire.
The Company also operates the US ISO Scheme, which is substantially the same as the Unapproved Scheme, the main difference being that the options are exercisable one to five years after their issue.
Under both of these schemes options are exercisable as follows: 25% maximum on first anniversary, 50% maximum on second anniversary, 75% maximum on third anniversary, 100% maximum on fourth anniversary.
Various options to directors under the Unapproved Scheme have certain performance criteria attached, which if met are exercisable after three years, otherwise they will become exercisable after seven years.
There are further schemes for our French and Belgian employees the French Scheme and the Belgian Scheme.
In the French Scheme, options are exercisable between four and seven years after their issue, whilst in the Belgian Scheme, options are exercisable from 1 January following the third anniversary after their issue, up to seven years from issue.
Upon the acquisition of Artisan in 2004, the Company assumed the share schemes of Artisan existing at acquisition.
The schemes remained substantially the same as prior to the acquisition, other than the options became options to purchase shares in ARM Holdings plc instead of Artisan Components Inc.
The number and value of options were amended in line with the conversion ratio as detailed in the merger agreement.
The schemes assumed were the 1993 Plan, the 1997 Plan, the 2000 Plan, the 2003 Plan, the Director Plan, the Executive Plan and the ND00 Plan.
Under each plan, there are multiple vesting templates and vesting periods.
The majority of the options were already vested upon acquisition, and the most common template was 25% vesting after one year, and then 6.25% vesting each quarter thereafter, until 100% vest after four years.
Some options vest on a monthly basis, and some vest over five years.
All options lapse ten years from the date of grant.
The Company also offers savings-related share option schemes for all employees and executive directors of the Company.
The number of options granted is related to the value of savings made by the employee.
The period of savings is three or five years except for employees of ARM Inc. and ARM Physical IP Inc. where the period is two years.
The option price is currently set at 85% of the market share price prior to the grant, and the right to exercise normally only arises for a six-month period once the savings have been completed except for ARM Inc. and ARM Physical IP Inc. where the right to exercise normally only arises for a three-month period once the savings have been completed.
The fair value of options granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The expected life is the expected period to exercise.
In 2004, the Group acquired Artisan Components Inc. and part of the consideration paid was in the form of ARM Holdings plc equity being issued to the former shareholders of Artisan.
The fair value of equity issued was 354,835,000.
Further consideration in the form of approximately 90.4 million options to purchase shares in ARM Holdings plc were granted with a fair value of 61,474,000.

Nazomi filed suit against ARM alleging wilful infringement of Nazomis US Patent No.
ARM answered Nazomis complaint in July 2002 denying infringement.
ARM moved for summary judgment and a ruling that the technology does not infringe Nazomis patent.
The United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted ARMs motion, and Nazomi appealed the District Courts ruling.
On 7 September 2004, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard the appeal and issued its decision on 11 April 2005.
Because, in the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the District Court did not construe the disputed claim term in sufficient detail for appellate review, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit remanded the dispute back to the District Court for further analysis.
A supplementary Markman hearing was held on 11 October 2005 and we are presently awaiting the ruling of the District Court.
Based on legal advice received to date, ARM has no cause to believe that the effect of the original ruling by the District Court will not be upheld.
Guarantees It is common industry practice for licensors of technology to offer to indemnify their licensees for loss suffered by the licensee in the event that the technology licensed is held to infringe the intellectual property of a third party.
Consistent with such practice, the Company provides such indemnification to its licensees but subject, in all cases, to a limitation of liability.
The obligation for the Company to indemnify its licensees is subject to certain provisos and is usually contingent upon a third party bringing an action against the licensee alleging that the technology licensed by the Company to the licensee infringes such third partys intellectual property rights.
The indemnification obligations typically survive any termination of the licence and will continue in perpetuity.
The Company does not provide for any such guarantees unless it has received notification from the other party that they are likely to invoke the guarantee.
The provision is made if both of the following conditions are met: i information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements: and ii the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated.
Any such provision is based upon the directors estimate of the expected costs of any such claim.
30 Related party transactions During the year, the Group paid royalty fees of 33,000 2004: 411,000 and made cross-licence payments of 26,000 2004: 14,000 to Superscape Group plc, a company in which Mike Inglis, an executive director of the Group, is a non-executive director.
Amounts owed to Superscape at 31 December 2005 and 2004 were nil.
During the year, the Group received licence fees of 321,000 2004: 209,000, support and maintenance income of 37,000 2004: 37,000 and evaluation tools fees of 17,000 2004: nil from CSR plc, a company in which John Scarisbrick, a non-executive director of ARM Holdings plc, is an executive director.
Amounts owed to CSR at 31 December 2005 and 2004 were nil.
There were no other related party transactions during 2005 or 2004 which require disclosure.
Key management compensation is disclosed in note 4.
31 Post-balance sheet events After the year end, the directors declared payment of a final dividend in respect of 2005 of 0.5 pence per share.
Subject to shareholder approval, the final dividend will be paid on 5 May 2006 to shareholders on the register on 31 March 2006.

adjustments to equity at 31 December 2004 and 1 January 2004 and to profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 The transition to IFRS resulted in the following changes in accounting policies: a Goodwill Goodwill is not amortised under IFRS but is measured at cost less impairment losses.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill was amortised on a straight-line basis over an estimate of the time the Group was to benefit from it.
The change does not affect equity at 1 January 2004 because, as permitted by IFRS 1, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004 date of transition to IFRS has been frozen at the UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date, the results of which assessment indicated no such impairment.
The 2004 annual report included a provisional assessment of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired on acquisition of Artisan Components Inc. on 23 December 2004.
Where these provisional values have been amended as estimates have been refined in 2005, adjustments to fair values have been recorded as prior year adjustments to goodwill for IFRS purposes.
This would not have been the case under UK GAAP.
b Other intangible assets Under IFRS, intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination may meet the criteria set out in IFRS 3 for categorisation as intangible assets other than goodwill and are amortised over their useful economic lives.
Under UK GAAP, intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination are included within the goodwill balance unless the asset can be identified and sold separately without disposing of the business as a whole.
In August and December 2004, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Axys Design Automation Inc. and Artisan Components Inc. respectively.
Both of these business combinations have been accounted for under IFRS 3.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under IFRS 1 not to apply IFRS retrospectively to business combinations occurring before 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
Thus, at 31 December 2004, 76,659,000 of intangible assets recognisable under IFRS 3, but subsumed within goodwill under UK GAAP, have been reclassified as intangible assets.
Amortisation expense in respect of these intangible assets has decreased profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 by 511,000.
Under IFRS, the difference between the book value of the intangible assets for accounting purposes and the tax value of these assets gives rise to a temporary difference.
A deferred tax liability of 30,409,000 at 31 December 2004 has therefore been recorded.
The deferred tax liability is released to the income statement in proportion to the amortisation of the related intangibles.
The impact is to increase the profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 by 204,000.
As intangible assets and goodwill arising on overseas acquisitions are treated as foreign currency assets of the acquired entities under IFRS but not under the Groups UK GAAP accounting policies, related foreign exchange movements have been recorded in reserves.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 73 Notes to the IFRS financial statements continued 33 Explanation of material adjustments to equity at 31 December 2004 and 1 January 2004 and to profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 continued c Computer software Under IFRS, computer software is classified within intangible assets.
Under UK GAAP, computer software was classified as a tangible fixed asset.
This change in accounting policy has resulted in a reclassification between plant, property and equipment and intangibles at 31 December 2004 and 1 January 2004. d Publicly traded investments Under IFRS, publicly traded investments are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value.
Under UK GAAP, these investments were carried at cost less any impairment charges.
e Embedded derivatives Under IFRS, where the Group enters into sales contracts denominated in a currency that is neither the functional currency of the Group nor the functional currency of the customer and where there are uninvoiced amounts on such contracts, such derivatives are carried at fair value.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
Embedded derivatives were not revalued to fair value under UK GAAP.
f Dividends payable Under IFRS, dividends to shareholders declared after the period end but before the financial statements are authorised for issue are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
A liability for a final dividend is recognised when the dividend is approved by shareholders: a liability for a dividend is recognised when paid.
Furthermore, under IFRS, dividends are not shown in the income statement but are recorded directly in reserves via retained earnings.
Under UK GAAP, dividends declared after the period end are recorded in the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate.
g Deferred tax assets and liabilities As required by IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements, deferred tax assets and liabilities have been classified as non-current assets and liabilities respectively.
Under UK GAAP, these were included within current assets and liabilities respectively.
Additionally, as required by IAS 12, Income taxes, deferred tax liabilities and assets have been offset where they arise in the same tax jurisdiction.
Under UK GAAP, there was no such right of offset.
The transition to IFRS has impacted the Groups deferred tax assets and liabilities as follows: 1 January 31 December 2004 2004 Notes 000 000 Deferred tax assets as reported under UK GAAP 3,585 20,832 Adjustment for: Deferred tax on share-based payments j 2,841 13,274 Deferred tax arising on available-for-sale investments measured at fair value d 446 2,077 Adjustment to provisional fair value of deferred tax in respect of Artisan acquisition 1,359 Netting-off of deferred tax assets and liabilities arising in same tax jurisdiction g 28,274 Deferred tax assets as reported under IFRS 5,980 2,396 Deferred tax liabilities as reported under UK GAAP Adjustments for: Deferred tax liability arising on recognition of intangibles on Axys acquisition b 795 Deferred tax liability arising on recognition of intangibles on Artisan acquisition b 29,614 Netting-off of deferred tax assets and liabilities arising in same tax jurisdiction g 28,274 Deferred tax liabilities as reported under IFRS 2,135 h Employers taxes on share options Under IFRS, employers taxes that are payable on the exercise of share options are calculated using the fair value of the Companys shares at the balance sheet date, pro-rated over the vesting period of the options.
Under UK GAAP, this calculation uses the market value of the Companys shares at the balance sheet date.
Additionally, under UK GAAP, employers taxes that are payable on the exercise of share options are included within provisions for liabilities and charges.
Under IFRS, these are included within accrued and other liabilities.
i Other reserves As permitted by IFRS 1, the cumulative translation adjustment has been reset to zero as at 1 January 2004.
This has had no effect on net equity but has decreased retained earnings by 2,088,000 as at December 2004 and 1 January 2004 with matching offsetting adjustments to the cumulative translation adjustment.
j Share-based payments The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
In accordance with IFRS 2, equity-settled sharebased payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant, in respect of options granted after 7 November 2002 and which were outstanding at 31 December 2004.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
Under UK GAAP, the charge recorded represented the difference between the share price at the date of grant and the exercise price of the option.
In addition, the Group took advantage of an exemption under which no charge was made in respect of SAYE options.
Thus, under UK GAAP, a charge was made only in respect of the LTIP with no other share-based payments charges being recognised.
As a consequence of accounting for share-based payments, a temporary difference between the accounting and tax bases arises, and a deferred tax asset is recorded.
74 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 33 Explanation of material adjustments to equity at 31 December 2004 and 1 January 2004 and to profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 continued k Prepayments and deferred revenue The conventions under which the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination is determined differ between IFRS and UK GAAP.
This has given rise to a difference in the fair value of prepayments and deferred revenue purchased as part of the Artisan acquisition.
In addition, under UK GAAP prepayments fully due after more than one year were included within current assets.
Under IFRS, prepayments falling due after more than one year are disclosed within non-current assets.
l Reversal of impairments In 2004, a previous impairment of an available-for-sale investment was reversed.
Under UK GAAP, this was taken as a credit to the income statement.
However, under IFRS, this was taken directly to equity via the revaluation reserve.
m Financial assets: fair value of currency exchange contracts Under IAS 32, financial assets are required to be disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet.
Under UK GAAP, these were disclosed within prepaid expenses and other assets at 31 December 2004 and within cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables at 1 January 2004. n Cash Under IAS 7, Cash flow statements, deposits with a maturity of less than three months at inception which are convertible into known amounts of cash are included as cash and cash equivalents.
Deposits with a maturity at inception of between three months and one year are shown as short-term investments.
Under UK GAAP, cash does not include short-term deposits and investments which cannot be withdrawn without notice and without incurring a penalty.
Such items are shown as short-term investments.
o Changes to the cash flow statement The consolidated statement of cash flows prepared under IFRS presents substantially the same information as that required under UK GAAP.
Under IFRS only three categories of cash flow activity are required to be reported: operating, investing and financing.
Cash flows from returns on investments and servicing of finance and cash flows from taxation shown under UK GAAP are included as operating activities and investing activities respectively under IFRS.
There are no other material differences between the cash flow statement presented under IFRS and the cash flow statement presented under UK GAAP.
34 Summary of significant differences between US GAAP and IFRS Goodwill Under both IFRS and US GAAP, goodwill is not subject to amortisation, but is tested at least annually for impairment.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Groups goodwill under IFRS has been frozen at the amount recorded under UK GAAP as at 1 January 2004.
Under US GAAP, following the provisions of SFAS 142, Goodwill and other intangible assets, the carrying value of goodwill was frozen at the amount recorded under previous US GAAP as at 1 January 2002.
Under both previous US GAAP and UK GAAP, goodwill was amortised over its useful economic life.
Thus, while ongoing accounting policies in respect of goodwill are similar under US GAAP and IFRS, the difference in the dates of transition means that different amounts of goodwill are recorded.
Under US GAAP, certain costs to be incurred on restructuring on business combination are treated as a fair value adjustment in the balance sheet acquired.
Under IFRS, these costs are expensed post-acquisition.
Additionally, under US GAAP, tax benefits arising from the exercise of options issued as part of the consideration for a business combination become a deduction to goodwill, only to the extent that those benefits do not exceed the fair value of the consideration relating to those options at the appropriate tax rate.
Any excess tax benefits are a deduction to equity.
Under IFRS, the full tax benefit is a deduction to equity.
The 2004 annual report included a provisional assessment of the fair values of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition of Artisan Components Inc. on 23 December 2004.
Under US GAAP, these are recorded as amendments to goodwill in the current period.
Recognition and amortisation of intangibles The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under IFRS 1 not to apply IFRS retrospectively to business combinations occurring before 1 January 2004.
This means that for business combinations occurring before this date, the previously reported UK GAAP treatment has continued to be followed.
Under previous UK GAAP, intangible assets were recognised separately from goodwill only where they could be sold separately without disposing of a business of the entity.
This separability criterion does not apply under either IFRS or US GAAP.
Thus, a number of intangible assets which are required to be recognised separately from goodwill under both IFRS 3 and SFAS 142, were subsumed within goodwill under UK GAAP.
Under both US GAAP and IFRS, such intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives.
Except in relation to in-process research and development see below, there is no difference in accounting policy for intangible assets recognised as a result of business combinations entered into after 1 January 2004.
In-process research and development Under IFRS, in-process research and development projects purchased as part of a business combination may meet the criteria set out in IAS 38, Intangible assets, for recognition as intangible assets other than goodwill and are amortised over their useful economic lives commencing when the asset is brought into use.
Under US GAAP, in-process research and development is immediately written-off to the income statement.
This accounting policy difference gives rise to an associated difference in deferred taxation.
Valuation of consideration on business combination Under both IFRS and US GAAP, the fair value of consideration in a business combination includes the fair value of both equity issued and any share options granted as part of that combination.
Under IFRS, any equity issued is valued at the fair value as of the date of completion, whilst under US GAAP, the equity is valued at the date the terms of the combination were agreed to and announced.
For options, under US GAAP, the fair value is based upon the total number of options granted, both vested and unvested, whilst under IFRS the fair value only includes those that have vested, together with a pro-rata value for partially vested options.
Furthermore, where there is contingent consideration for an acquisition, under IFRS this is recognised as part of the purchase consideration if the contingent conditions are expected to be satisfied, whilst under US GAAP it is only recognised if the conditions have actually been met.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 75 Notes to the IFRS financial statements continued 34 Summary of significant differences between US GAAP and IFRS continued Deferred compensation Under US GAAP, the intrinsic value of unvested stock options issued by an acquirer as part of a business combination in exchange for unvested share options of the acquiree is recorded as a debit balance within shareholders funds.
This amount is charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period of the share options in accordance with FIN 28.
Under IFRS, no such adjustment to shareholders funds is made on acquisition.
Compensation charge in respect of share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
In accordance with IFRS 2, equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
Under US GAAP, the Group accounts for share option compensation expense under APB 25, and thus no compensation expense is recorded where the exercise price of the option is equal to the share price on the date of grant.
Under US GAAP, the Group recognises a compensation charge in respect of the UK SAYE plans.
The compensation charge is calculated as the difference between the market price of the shares at the date of grant and the exercise price of the option and is recorded on a straight-line basis over the savings period.
In addition, certain options attract a charge under variable plan accounting under US GAAP.
Under IFRS, this charge is calculated in the same manner as other share-based payments, as detailed above.
Under US GAAP, the Group follows variable plan accounting for the LTIP grants, measuring compensation expense as the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at each period end over the vesting period of the share awards.
Increases in fair market value of the shares result in a charge and decreases in fair market value of the shares result in a credit, subject to the cumulative amount previously expensed.
Deferred tax on UK and US share options In the US and the UK, the Group is entitled to a tax deduction for the amount treated as employee compensation under US and UK tax rules on exercise of certain employee share options.
The compensation is equivalent to the difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the date of exercise.
Under IFRS, deferred tax assets are recognised and are calculated by comparing the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future based on the Companys share price at the balance sheet date with the cumulative amount of the compensation expense recorded in the income statement.
If the amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory tax rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, against the profit and loss reserve.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2, no compensation charge is recorded in respect of options granted before 7 November 2002 or in respect of those options which have been exercised or have lapsed before 31 December 2004.
Under US GAAP, deferred tax assets are recognised by multiplying the compensation expense recorded by the prevailing tax rate in the relevant tax jurisdiction.
Where, on exercise of the relevant option, the tax benefit obtained exceeds the deferred tax asset in relation to the relevant options, the excess is recorded in additional paid-in capital.
Where the tax benefit is less than the deferred tax asset, the write-down of the deferred tax asset is recorded against additional paid-in capital to the extent of previous excess tax benefits recorded in this account, with any remainder recorded in the income statement.
Employer taxes on share options Under IFRS, employers taxes that are payable on the exercise of share options are provided for over the vesting period of the options.
Under US GAAP, such taxes are accounted for when the options are exercised.

The matters addressed in this operating and financial review and prospects, with the exception of the historical information presented, contain forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties.
Overview ARM designs the technology that lies at the heart of advanced digital products, from wireless, networking and consumer entertainment solutions to imaging, automotive, security and storage devices.
ARMs comprehensive product offering includes 16 32-bit RISC microprocessors, data engines, 3D processors, digital libraries, embedded memories, peripherals, software and development tools, as well as analog functions and high-speed connectivity products.
The Company licenses this technology to semiconductor companies which, in turn, manufacture, market and sell microprocessors and related products.
ARM has developed an innovative,  and market-driven business model in which it neither manufactures nor sells the products incorporating ARM technology, but concentrates on the research and development, design and support of the ARM architecture and supporting development tools and software.
Combined with the Companys broad Partner community, they provide a total system solution that offers a fast, reliable path to market for leading electronics companies.
Market conditions 2005 was another challenging year for the semiconductor industry, though there were signs of gradual improvement in the second half.
ARM has performed well despite these conditions, with our revenue growth doubling the overall growth in the industry.
Both our royalty revenues and units have increased significantly compared with previous years and quarter-on-quarter throughout 2005.
Overall licensing backlog remains healthy with backlog relating to physical IP products at a record level at the end of the year.
2006 is looking to have a more favourable backdrop though as always the Company is susceptible to the timing of new licenses through the year.
That said, all indications are for a year of growth in dollar revenues in all areas of the business.
As well as growing profitability, the Company has been robustly cash generative before investing activities, with net cash inflows from operating activities of 47.2 million, giving rise to a year-end cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities balance of 160.9 million.
The table below sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in the Companys consolidated statements of income.
Year ended 31 December 2003 2004 2005 % % % Revenues: Product revenues 88.2 90.7 93.7 Service revenues 11.8 9.3 6.3 Total revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of revenues: Product costs 4.8 4.4 8.3 Service costs 3.8 3.3 2.6 Total cost of revenues 8.6 7.7 10.9 Gross profit 91.4 92.3 89.1 Operating expenses: Research and development 37.6 32.8 25.8 Sales and marketing 17.9 15.7 14.7 General and administrative 22.0 19.9 16.2 Amortization of deferred stock-based compensation 0.4 0.6 4.2 In-process research and development 2.3 0.1 Amortization of intangibles purchased through business combination 0.4 7.5 Total operating expenses 77.9 71.7 68.5 Income from operations 13.5 20.6 20.6 Interest, net 3.7 4.5 2.3 Minority interest 0.1 Income before income tax 17.1 25.1 22.9 Provision for income taxes 7.0 6.8 4.9 Net income 10.1 18.3 18.0 Total revenues Total revenues were 232.4 million in 2005, an increase of 52% from 152.9 million in 2004, which was a 19% increase from 128.1 million in 2003.
Dollar revenues were $418.7 million in 2005, an increase of 54% from $272.4 million in 2004 which was an increase of 32% over the $206.5 million in 2003.
The actual average dollar exchange rate in 2005 was $1.80 compared with $1.78 in 2004.
This had the effect of reducing total reported revenues by approximately 2.8 million.
The figures for 2004 and 2003 do not include revenues for the Artisan business acquired in December 2004.
If these were included, dollar revenues increased by 18% in 2005 from the pro forma $355.5 million in 2004 of the combined ARM and Artisan businesses.
Product revenues Product revenues consist of license fees, sales of development systems and royalties.
Product revenues for 2003, 2004 and 2005 were 113.0 million, 138.7 million and 217.7 million, representing 88%, 91% and 94% of total revenues respectively.
License revenues increased from 50.8 million in 2003 to 59.4 million in 2004, and increased further to 104.2 million in 2005 representing approximately 40%, 39% and 45% of total revenues in 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 79 Operating and financial review and prospects US GAAP continued Having grown license revenues by 27% and 19% in 2004 and 2005 respectively, ARM enters 2006 well placed to maintain momentum in processor licensing.
The portfolio of licensable products comprises a rich mix of well-proven ARM technology, such as the ARM7 and ARM9 families of products, products introduced in recent years which are still in the early stages of their licensing life cycle, such as the ARM11 family of products, and the first three Cortex family products which have already been licensed by lead Partners and which will be available for general licensing in 2006.
71 new licenses were signed in 2005 compared to 65 in 2004 and 51 in 2003.
ARM11 accounted for 21% of license revenues in 2005, compared to 17% in 2004 and 10% in 2003.
32 companies became new ARM Partners in 2005, bringing the total number of semiconductor partners to 172 at the end of 2005.
This total number of semiconductor partners was net of those companies that have signed licenses with ARM in the past but have since been acquired by other companies or who no longer have access to ARM technology for other reasons.
In October 2005, we formally launched the Cortex-A8 processor, the industrys fastest embedded processor to date and the first complete processing solution comprising a broad portfolio of ARM technology to reduce time-to-market.
The award-winning Cortex-A8 processor is expected to revolutionize consumer and low-power mobile devices, enabling the delivery of higher levels of entertainment and innovation to end users.
Its performance and power utilization characteristics make it ideal for demanding consumer products running multi-channel video, audio and gaming applications.
The exceptional speed and power efficiency of the Cortex-A8 processor is enabled by new ARM Artisan libraries supporting technologies such as Intelligent Energy Manager IEM.
Additionally, the new processor features ARM TrustZone technology for secure transactions.
The ARM TrustZone Software Application Program Interface API is gaining wide industry endorsement and quickly becoming a standard foundation for the implementation of security functions such as digital rights management, device protection and payment.
The Cortex-M3 processor has been licensed to four lead partners to date.
Initial product deliveries were successfully made to the lead partners in Q4 2005 and the product is now available for mainstream licensing.
Test silicon for the Cortex-M3 processor has been received and is exhibiting higher performance and smaller size characteristics than initially expected.
The Cortex-M3 processor is specifically designed to meet the requirement for high system performance in microcontrollers and other very cost-sensitive embedded applications such as automotive products and white goods.
The microcontroller market has traditionally been serviced by 8- and 16-bit devices, but it has seen a substantial increase in performance requirements as users demand greater flexibility based in software, and as cost pressures drive the consolidation of applications on to a single device.
The Cortex-M3 processor, with multiple technologies to reduce memory use whilst delivering industry-leading power and performance, provides an ideal platform both to accelerate the migration of thousands of applications from legacy components to 32-bit microcontrollers and for use in such products as ultra low-cost mobile handsets.
The third Cortex family product available for mainstream licensing in 2006, currently code-named ServalE, has been licensed by two lead partners to date.
ARMs ServalE next-generation processor for deeply-embedded applications is expected to be available for mainstream licensing in the first half of 2006.
License revenues from non-core products, covering items such as platforms, peripherals, embedded trace modules, embedded software, data engines, models and sub-systems, increased in 2005 to 11.1 million from 10.5 million in 2004 and 8.9 million in 2003 representing approximately 16% of license revenues in 2005, 18% in 2004 and 18% in 2003.
2005 saw the first synergistic benefits from the combination of ARM and Artisan, both in terms of revenue and technology collaboration, with a total of seven synergistic revenue deals signed in 2005.
Synergistic deals include both instances of physical IP being licensed to ARM Partners and instances of contracts being won against the competition due to both processor and physical IP being available from ARM.
ARMs Physical IP division PIPD reported license revenues of 34.8 million in 2005, representing approximately 33% of total license revenues.
In the first half of 2005, ARM introduced the first innovative business model to result from the combination of ARM and Artisan, with the announcement on 11 April 2005 of the launch of the ARM DesignStart programme, a potentially significant broadening of the reach of ARMs existing Foundry Programme, which allows developers access to the ARM7TDMI processor for the TSMC, UMC, SMIC and Chartered Semiconductor process technologies at no initial charge.
By leveraging the web-based distribution channel developed by Artisan, developers are able to gain early access to ARM technology to complete the design process all the way through to chip-level verification.
Once the design is finished and ready for fabrication, a single-use design license can be purchased from ARM to receive a full set of deliverables, enabling tape out and manufacture at any of the supported foundries.
As well as the Cortex-A8 processor, we are already developing other products which benefit from the integration of processor and physical IP.
In January 2006, we unveiled a ground-breaking high performance implementation of the ARM1176JZF-S processor, enhanced with the ARM Artisan Advantage cell 2 library and memories, which achieves a frequency of more than 750 MHz in a high-performance 90nm foundry process while occupying less than 2.4 mm of silicon area.
This represents a significant performance increase through a combination of collaborative design, advanced physical IP and process technology.
The optimized implementation delivers an industry-leading performance for existing applications and operating systems without the need for expensive software re-design or re-compilation.
Further, the ongoing collaboration between PIPD and ARMs Fabric IP business unit yielded fruit in the fourth quarter of 2005 with the first 130nm test chip with combined DDR and PrimeCell peripherals being received back from the fab and working first time.
Revenues from the sale of development systems increased from 17.9 million in 2003 to 19.7 million in 2004 to 25.7 million in 2005 representing approximately 14%, 13% and 11% of total revenues in 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively.
This growth has been generated by working with customers on longer term relationships for the supply of RealView Developer tools for software development, continued momentum behind the RealView Create tools for Electronic System Level design tools ESL customers and a buoyant market place for tools to support the broad portfolio of ARM microprocessors.
Development Systems has entered into more multi-year contracts for larger product volumes which improves the visibility of business going forward and builds a good customer base from which to drive new innovation.
Following the acquisition of Axys in August 2004, ARM has further strengthened its Development Systems business with the acquisition of two microcontroller tools suppliers in October 2005, namely Keil Elektronik GmbH and Keil Software Inc.
These acquisitions enable ARM to benefit even further from the accelerating growth in the 32-bit microcontroller market and provides the Company access to a well-developed channel through which to sell microcontroller toolkits in order to address the much larger customer base associated with this market.
80 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 Royalties are either set as a percentage of the licensees net sales price per chip or, less frequently, as a fixed amount and are recognized when the Company receives notification from the customer of product sales.
In effect, this means that it is normally in the quarter following the shipments that data is received and so royalty data for a year reflects actual shipments made from the beginning of October of the previous year to the end of September of the current year.
Royalties increased from 44.3 million in 2003 to 59.6 million in 2004 and increased further to 87.8 million in 2005, representing 34%, 39% and 38% of total revenues in 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively.
The 2005 revenues are split 72.5 million from the processor division royalties and 15.3 million from the physical IP division.
Volume shipments increased from 782 million units in 2003 to 1,272 million in 2004, with the increase in volumes coming from all market segments, especially consumer entertainment and storage products.
Total unit shipments in 2005 of 1,662 million were 31% up on 2004.
Unit shipments in the mobile segment grew by 23% year-on-year and in the non-mobile segments by 46%.
Growth in the non-mobile segments was achieved across a broad range of product applications including hard disk drives, games consoles, smart cards, printers, DVD players, flash memory products, digital still cameras, WiFi chipsets and automotive products.
The Company expects royalty revenues to grow year-on-year although they may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter.
The total number of partners shipping ARM technology-based product at the end of 2005 was 68 after taking into account corporate activity within the ARM partnership.
19 companies are paying royalties for physical IP products at the end of the year.
Royalties within PIPD have demonstrated market share growth against the backdrop of a difficult year for the foundries.
Service revenues Service revenues consist of design consulting services and revenues from support, maintenance and training.
Service revenues decreased from 15.1 million in 2003 to 14.2 million in 2004, but grew to 14.7 million in 2005, representing 12%, 9% and 6% of total revenues in 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively.
The decrease in 2004 was primarily due to foreign exchange as the majority of revenues for the business are in US dollars and service revenues for 2003, 2004 and 2005 grew from $24.5 million to $25.1 million to $26.5 million respectively.
Geographic analysis Operating in a global environment, the geographic destinations of the Companys revenues fluctuate from period to period depending upon the country of origin of its customers.
The pattern of revenues in 2005 was 43% of revenues coming from the US, 18% from Japan, 25% from Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, and 14% from Europe.
In 2004, revenues from the US represented 51%, Japan 21%, Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, 13%, and Europe 15%.
In 2003, revenues from the US represented 51%, Japan 19%, Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, 12%, and Europe 18%.
Product costs Product costs are limited to variable costs of production such as the costs of manufacture of development systems, amortization of our thirdparty technology licenses, cross-license payments to collaborative partners and time of engineers on PIPD projects.
Product costs were 6.2 million in 2003, 6.7 million in 2004 and 19.3 million in 2005, representing 5%, 4% and 8% of total revenues in 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively.
The large increase in product costs in 2005 is as a result of the PIPD direct costs of revenue, namely the associated engineering time spent on revenue-projects.
Approximately two-thirds of total product cost of sales were made up of development systems costs in both 2004 and 2003, with the balance comprising additional costs related to the costs of third-party licenses and cross-license payments to collaborative partners.
In 2005, the proportion of development systems costs fell to approximately a quarter, PIPD direct costs approximately two-thirds and the balance third-party licenses and cross-license payments.
Product gross margin in 2005 was 91%, compared to 95% in 2004 and 95% in 2003.
In 2005, product gross margin in the Company excluding PIPD was 96% and for PIPD was 75%.
The Company does not currently expect a significant increase in product costs in 2006.
Service costs Service costs include the costs of support and maintenance services to licensees of ARM technology as well as the costs directly attributable to consulting work performed for third parties.
Cost of services increased from 4.9 million in 2003 to 5.1 million in 2004 and 6.1 million in 2005.
The gross margins earned on service revenues were approximately 68% in 2003, 64% in 2004 and 59% in 2005.
Whilst services revenues have remained relatively flat in 2004 and 2005, costs have increased as the business invests more into the engineering departments, a proportion of which is allocated to services costs.
Research and development costs Research and development costs increased from 48.1 million in 2003 to 50.1 million in 2004 to 60.1 million in 2005, representing 38%, 33% and 26% of total revenues in 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively.
Continued investment in research and development remains an essential part of the Companys strategy since the development of new products to license is key to its ongoing success.
Total engineering headcount increased from 442 at the end of 2003 to 739 at the end of 2004.
The increase in 2004 was due to the acquisitions of both Artisan and Axys as well as some growth within the existing business.
Engineering headcount at the end of 2005 was 846 with the increases coming from organic growth predominantly in India but in all locations around the world, as well as from the Keil acquisitions.
Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenditure increased from 23.0 million in 2003 to 23.9 million in 2004 and was 34.1 million in 2005, representing 18% of total revenues in 2003, 16% in 2004, and 15% in 2005.
Headcount in this area increased from 203 at 31 December 2003 to 282 at the end of 2004, and was 297 at the end of 2005.
Most of the growth in 2004 came from the acquisitions but there was also growth with new offices opening in Bangalore, India and Beijing, PR China.
The total number of offices with sales people is currently 22 and this enables improved contact with the Companys geographically diverse customer base.
General and administrative General and administrative headcount at 31 December 2005 was 181, up from 150 at the end of 2004 and 95 at the end of 2003.
Again, the majority of the increase in 2004 came from the acquisitions, whilst the increase in 2005 has come partly from acquisitions but also organic growth to strengthen the infrastructure of the Company as it continually expands.
General and administrative costs were 28.1 million in 2003, 30.4 million in 2004 and 37.6 million in 2005, representing 22%, 20% and 16% of total revenues respectively.
Costs in 2005 include 0.3 million of impairments made to investments 2003: 1.6 million: 2004: nil.
Litigation costs were 9.1 million in 2003, 5.1 million in 2004 and 0.4 million in 2005, fluctuations arising largely as a result of annual variations in the amount of legal expenses relating to patent protection cases and other similar costs.
Legal costs in 2003 were particularly high due to the provision for settlement of the Herodion arbitration which was paid early in 2004.
4.5 million of the costs in 2004 related to a technology license agreement signed in the year.
Expense in relation to provisions for doubtful debts were 0.5 million in 2005, a release of 0.1 million in 2004 and a further release of 0.1 million in 2003.
Unrealized future foreign exchange gains on certain committed but not yet invoiced future revenue streams of 2.1 million 2004: losses of 0.7 million: 2003: losses of 1.1 million were recorded in accordance with SFAS 133.
There was a gain on foreign exchange of 0.9 million in 2003 but losses of 1.5 million and 2.3 million in 2004 and 2005 respectively.
See Foreign Currency Fluctuations below.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 81 Operating and financial review and prospects US GAAP continued Amortization of deferred stock-based compensation Deferred stock-based compensation arises on the Company's SAYE and LTIP schemes see Accounting for stock-based compensation in note 1 to the financial statements below and the amortization of charges deferred on new options granted as part of the acquisition of Artisan.
In-process research and development During 2004, the Company purchased Axys Design Automation Inc. and Artisan Components Inc. now ARM Physical IP Inc.. Those intangible assets that were still in development known as in-process research and development were charged directly to the income statement, amounting to 0.4 million and 3.2 million for Axys and Artisan respectively.
A further 0.3 million of Artisan in-process research and development was charged to the income statement in 2005 as the final valuation of intangibles was completed.
All acquired in-process research and development from the Axys and Artisan acquisitions are progressing as expected with some still incomplete as at 31 December 2005.
Amortization of intangible assets Various licenses to use third party technology have been signed over the past several years, with their values being capitalized and amortized over the useful economic period that the Company is expected to gain benefit from them generally between three and five years.
Licenses totaling 4.7 million were purchased during 2001 to 2004 with amortization of these licenses amounting to 0.5 million in 2005 2004: 0.5 million: 2003: 1.2 million.
A further license for 1.0 million was purchased in 2005 and is being amortized over five years with 0.3 million being charged in 2005.
Following the out-of-court settlement of the Companys litigation against picoTurbo, Inc. in December 2001, picoTurbo assigned its intellectual property rights to the Company for a payment of 7.5 million.
This is being amortized over four years and 1.5 million was charged to the income statement in 2002 and 2.0 million in 2003, 2004 and 2005.
The Company also purchased a patent for 0.7 million in 2002 which is being amortized over five years.
The amortization charge was 0.1 million in 2003, 2004 and 2005.
During 2003, the Company purchased Adelante Technologies NV now ARM Belgium NV.
Included with the assets purchased were 0.3 million of intangible assets comprising developed technology and customer relationships which are being amortized over five years and two years respectively.
The amortization charge for the assets during 2005 and 2004 was 0.1 million in each year 2003: less than 0.1 million.
During 2004, the Company purchased Axys Design Automation Inc and Artisan Components Inc. now ARM Physical IP Inc. Intangibles acquired and capitalized as part of these business combinations totaled 1.9 million and 70.9 million respectively and are being amortized over five years and between one and six years respectively see note 6 for further details.
The total charge during 2004 was 0.1 million and 0.3 million for Axys and Artisan respectively, and during 2005 was 0.4 million and 16.5 million.
During 2005, the Company purchased Keil Elektronik GmbH and Keil Software Inc. Intangibles acquired and capitalized consisted of developed technology, customer relationships and tradenames and totaled 8.7 million.
These are being amortized between two and five years and the amortization during 2005 totaled 0.4 million.
Interest Interest receivable increased from 4.8 million in 2003 to 6.9 million in 2004, but fell to 5.3 million in 2005.
The growth in interest in 2003 and 2004 was due to higher average cash balances and increasing interest rates, but fell in 2005 as a result of the cash outflow at the end of 2004 for the acquisition of Artisan.
The Company invested cash balances over periods of up to one year during 2005, although most were for periods less than six months.
Income before income tax Income before income tax was 22.0 million in 2003, 38.5 million in 2004 and 53.2 million in 2005, representing 17%, 25% and 23% of total revenues respectively.
The increased margin in 2004 was due to higher revenue and continued cost control, and would have been higher without non-recurring and acquisition-related charges of 9.7 million during the year comprising 4.5 million of a non-recurring technology license charge, 3.6 million of in-process research and development write-off, 0.6 million of business combination intangible amortization and 1.0 million of deferred stock-based compensation.
Similarly the primary reason for the fall in margin in 2005 was due to acquisition-related charges in-process research and development of 0.3 million and 17.4 million of business combination intangible amortization and deferred stock-based compensation of 10.4 million.
Tax charge The Companys effective tax rates were 40.7% in 2003, 27.2% in 2004 and 21.3% in 2005.
The effective tax rate fell in 2004 with additional costs being allowable for research and development tax credits, additional deferred tax credits arising from employee share options and some of the noncash accounting charges being claimed in 2004.
It fell further in 2005 primarily as a result of benefits arising from the structuring of the Artisan acquisition.
Liquidity and capital resources The Companys operating activities provided net cash of 38.7 million, 46.5 million and 47.2 million in 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively.
Accounts receivable fell by 4.5 million in 2003 but increased by 1.4 million in 2004 and 21.2 million in 2005.
This is partly due to the overall increasing revenues earned in the periods leading up to the end of the respective years and also partly due to foreign exchange translation of the underlying dollar balances.
Prepaid expenses fell by 2.8 million in 2003, increased by 3.4 million in 2004 and fell by 1.4 million in 2005.
The Company entered into several leases for design automation tools during 2002, which resulted in an initial large increase in prepaid expenses, but fell in 2003 as a result of the lease payments being for shorter prepaid periods than in previous years.
This has been similar in 2004 and the increase was due to a technology license agreement signed in the year under which amounts representing prepaid royalties will be released over the next several years.
The fall in 2005 reflected this amortization.
Accounts payable reduced by 2.5 million in 2003, increased in 2004 by 1.2 million but were 1.9 million lower in 2005.
This is purely related to the timing of receipt of supplier invoices in the respective years.
Accrued liabilities increased by 7.0 million in 2003, increased by a further 2.8 million in 2004 but fell by 5.6 million in 2005.
The significant increase in 2003 was primarily as a result of the accrual for the Herodion legal settlement of 6.4 million which was paid early in 2004, and increased in 2004 as a result of provisions for staff costs and further payments on a technology license agreement signed in the year.
These have fallen in 2005 as some payments on the technology license agreement have been made.
In addition, accrued employee compensation was lower in 2005 than in 2004.
82 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 At 31 December 2005, the Company recorded approximately 20.4 million in deferred revenues which represented cash or receivables scheduled to be recognized as revenues in varying amounts after 31 December 2005.
At 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003, the Company recorded approximately 21.4 million and 11.1 million respectively in deferred revenues.
Deferred revenues are an element of customer backlog, and represent amounts invoiced to customers not yet recognized as revenues in the income statement.
As such this balance fluctuates due to the maturity profile of ARM's products, and invoicing milestones within contracts.
The significant increase in 2004, though, was predominantly due to the acquisition of Artisan.
The Company believes that, given its current level of business, it has sufficient working capital for the foreseeable future.
Cash flow from operations has been used to fund the working capital requirements of the Company as well as capital expenditure.
Capital expenditure in 2005 was 6.1 million, compared with 5.0 million in 2004 and 3.6 million in 2003.
Capital expenditure increased in 2004 with increases in both levels of staff and a new IT system being designed and implemented during the year.
This continued into 2005 as staff levels increased and general operational assets were replaced.
In 2003, the Company acquired the 15% minority interest in ARM Korea Limited for cash consideration of 3.0 million bringing its holding to 100%.
The Company also acquired the entire share capital of Adelante Technologies N. V. now renamed ARM Belgium N. V. for total consideration of 0.4 million.
In 2004, the Company acquired the entire share capitals of Axys Design Automation Inc. and Artisan Components Inc. for total consideration of 6.9 million and 481.7 million respectively, with cash consideration comprising 6.9 million and 122.3 million respectively.
Cash acquired with these businesses amounted to 82.7 million.
In 2005, the Company made final payments relating to acquisition costs for Artisan of 14.4 million, as well as 1.7 million of contingent consideration from the Axys acquisition as a result of performance conditions being achieved.
A further 4.3 million net of cash acquired was paid for the acquisitions of Keil Elektronik GmbH and Keil Software Inc.
The Company envisages making further strategic investments in the future, in situations where the Company can broaden its product portfolio, where it can obtain skilled engineering resources and where the potential for furthering ARM core-based design wins is improved significantly.
In 2003 the Company invested a further 1.2 million in Superscape Group plc as part of a further funding round, thus maintaining its holding.
In 2004, the Company invested a total of 0.2 million in two small unlisted companies, Zeevo Inc. and Reciva Limited, giving a minority holding of less than 3% in both companies.
In 2005, 0.3 million was invested via convertible loan notes in Luminary Micro Inc. a small unlisted company.
During 2005, the Company initiated a share buyback program to supplement dividends in returning surplus funds to shareholders.
During 2005, the Company bought back over 13.9 million shares at a total cost of 16.2 million.
Dividends totalling 10.4 million were also paid to shareholders during the year 2004: 9.0 million.
Share option exercises during the year gave rise to 13.9 million cash inflow to the Company compared to 1.3 million in 2004.
Cash, cash equivalents, shortand long-term investment and marketable securities balances at 31 December 2005 were 160.9 million compared to 142.8 million at 31 December 2004 and 159.8 million at 31 December 2003.
Foreign currency fluctuations The Companys earnings and liquidity are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally the US dollar rate, reflecting the fact that most of the Companys revenues and cash receipts are denominated in US dollars while a high proportion of its costs are in sterling.
The Company reduces this US dollar sterling risk where possible by currency hedging.
Due to the high value and timing of receipts on individual licenses and the requirement to settle certain expenses in US dollars, the Company reviews its foreign exchange exposure on a  basis.
It then hedges this exposure using forward contracts for the sale of US dollars, which are negotiated with major UK clearing banks.
The average size of each forward contract was $4.6 million in 2003, $5.1 million in 2004 and $4.3 million in 2005.
The Company also uses currency options as a further translation instrument for limited proportions of its dollar exposure.
The fair values of the financial instruments outstanding at 31 December 2003, 2004 and 2005 are disclosed in note 15 to the financial statements.
The settlement period of the forward contracts outstanding at 31 December 2005 is between 12 January 2006 and 29 March 2006.
The settlement period of the option contracts outstanding at 31 December 2005 is between 10 January 2006 and 27 December 2006.
Quantitative and qualitative information on market risk During the preceding fiscal year, the Company was exposed to foreign currency exchange risk inherent in its sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than sterling.
ARM transacts business in approximately eight foreign currencies worldwide, of which the most significant to the Company's operations were the US dollar, the euro and the Japanese yen for 2005.
For most currencies, the Company is a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefits from a weaker sterling and is adversely affected by a stronger sterling relative to those foreign currencies.
The Company has performed a sensitivity analysis at 31 December 2005, 2004 and 2003, using a modeling technique that measures the changes in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to sterling with all other variables held constant.
The analysis covers all of the Company's foreign currency contracts offset by the underlying exposures.
The foreign currency exchange rates used were based on market rates in effect at 31 December 2005, 2004 and 2003.
The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a loss in the fair values of ARM's foreign exchange derivative financial instruments, net of exposures, of 3.9 million at 31 December 2005 2004: 8.6 million, 2003: 0.7 million.
Risk factors The Company operates in the intensely competitive semiconductor industry which is characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, short product life cycles, cyclical market patterns and heightened foreign and domestic competition.
The Company believes that its future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon a wide variety of factors.
These include the timing of entering into agreements with new licensees, the mixture of license fees, royalties and fees from services, the introduction of new technology by the Company, the timing of orders from, and shipments to, systems companies of ARM core-based microprocessors from the Companys semiconductor partners and sudden technological change in the microprocessor industry.
Other risks include the reliance on semiconductor partners, dependence upon systems companies, patent protection, attraction and retention of employees, management of growth, competition and vulnerability to general economic conditions.
Risk factors are more fully discussed in the Companys annual report on Form 20-F.
All activities relate to continuing operations.

ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 87 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies The business of the Company ARM Holdings plc and its subsidiary companies ARM or the Company design reduced instruction set computing RISC microprocessors, physical IP and related technology and software, and sell Development Systems, to enhance the performance, cost-effectiveness and power-efficiency of high-volume embedded applications.
The Company licenses and sells its technology and products to leading international electronics companies, which in turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits ASICs and application-specific standard processors ASSPs based on the Companys architecture to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products.
By creating a network of Partners, and working with them to best utilize the Companys technology, the Company is establishing its architecture as a RISC processor for use in many high-volume embedded microprocessor applications, including digital cellular phones, modems and automotive functions and for potential use in many growing markets, including smart cards and digital video.
The Company also licenses and sells Development Systems direct to systems companies and provides consulting and support services to its licensees, systems companies and other systems designers.
The Companys principal geographic markets are Europe, the US and Asia Pacific.
Incorporation and history ARM is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales.
The Company was formed on 16 October 1990, as a joint venture between Apple Computer UK Limited, and Acorn Computers Limited, and operated under the name Advanced RISC Machines Holdings Limited until 10 March 1998, when its name was changed to ARM Holdings plc.
Group undertakings include ARM Limited incorporated in the UK, ARM Inc. incorporated in the US, ARM Physical IP Inc. formerly Artisan Components Inc. incorporated in the US, Axys Design Automation Inc. incorporated in the US, Keil Software Inc. incorporated in the US, acquired during 2005, ARM KK incorporated in Japan, ARM Korea Limited incorporated in South Korea, ARM France SAS incorporated in France, ARM Belgium N. V. incorporated in Belgium, ARM Germany GmbH incorporated in Germany, renamed during 2005, Keil Elektronik GmbH incorporated in Germany, acquired during 2005, ARM Embedded Technologies Pvt Limited incorporated in India, renamed during 2005, ARM Physical IP Asia Pacific Pte.
Limited incorporated in Singapore, renamed during 2005, ARM Taiwan Limited incorporated in Taiwan and ARM Consulting Shanghai Co. Limited incorporated in PR China.
Basis of preparation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States US GAAP.
The Company maintains its accounting records and prepares its financial statements in UK sterling.
Purely for the convenience of the reader, the 31 December 2005 consolidated financial statements have been translated from sterling at the closing rate on 31 December 2005 of 1.00 $1.7168.
Such translations should not be construed as representations that the sterling amounts represent, or have been or could be so converted into US dollars at that rate or at any other rate.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
The results of subsidiaries acquired in the year are included in the income statement from the date they are acquired.
Investments Publicly traded investments are classed as available for sale in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
115, Accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and are carried at fair value.
Unrealized holding gains or losses on such securities are included, net of related taxes, in other comprehensive income.
Other-than-temporary impairment losses and realized gains and losses of such securities are reported in earnings.
Equity securities that are not publicly traded are recorded at cost less permanent diminution in value: at 31 December 2005 and 2004, the estimated fair value of these investments approximated their recorded basis, based on estimates determined by management.
During 2002 and 2003, the Company made investments in Superscape Group plc, a company listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The approximate holding at 31 December 2005 is 8%.
In 2004, the Company made a less than 1% investment in Zeevo Inc. and a less than 3% investment in Reciva Limited.
In 2005, the Company made an investment by way of convertible loan notes in Luminary Micro Inc. Intangible assets Purchased patents and licenses to use technology are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a prudent estimate of the time that the Company is expected to benefit from them.
Although an independent valuation is made of any intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination, management is primarily responsible for determining the fair value of intangible assets.
Such assets are capitalized and amortized over a period of one to six years, being a prudent estimate of the time that the Company is expected to benefit from them, with the exception of in-process research and development which is written off immediately.
Prior to 2002, purchased goodwill was capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a prudent estimate of the time that the Company is expected to benefit from it.
Upon adoption of SFAS 142, on 1 January 2002, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill.
The value of goodwill carried forward at the end of 2001 has been frozen at 2,274,000.
This goodwill, together with goodwill arising on acquisitions since 2002, will be tested for impairment at least annually.
An annual impairment review in 2005 determined that there was no indication of impairment with respect to goodwill.
The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgement and are based on assumptions about expected future operating performance.
The actual cash flows could differ from management's estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions.
"88 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued In accordance with SFAS 131 ""Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information"", the Company has identified its operating segments based on the information used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker in monitoring the business."
For the purposes of assessing the carrying value of goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to reporting units.
Based on the nature and extent of discrete information available to management, the Company believes that, for ARM, each operating segment consists of a single reporting unit.
Goodwill has been allocated to the two reporting units on the with and without basis in accordance with SFAS 142.
Impairment charges The Company reviews long-lived assets, identifiable intangibles and related goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
If the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of such assets, an impairment loss would be recognized, and the assets would be written down to their estimated fair value.
Revenue recognition Revenue consists of license fees received under the terms of license agreements with customers to enable them to use the Companys intellectual property IP, which may be customized to each customers manufacturing process.
The Company receives royalties on sales by the Companys customers of products containing ARM technology.
It also supplies off-the-shelf software tools, bought-in boards and toolkits, training and consultancy services.
The Company primarily earns revenues from licensing its IP to leading electronics companies which in turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, ASICs and ASSPs based on the Companys architecture to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products.
The Companys IP consists of software and related documentation which enables a customer to design and manufacture microprocessors and related technology and software.
Most licenses are designed to meet the specific requirements of each customer and are generally not time limited in their application.
In general, the time between the signing of a license and final validation of the customers ARM-compliant product is between six and 15 months.
Upgrades or modifications to the licensed IP are not provided.
Following validation of the customers ARM-compliant product, the Company has no further obligations under the license agreement.
In accordance with SOP 81-1, Accounting for performance of construction-type and certain production type contracts, when license agreements include deliverables that require significant production, modification or customization, contract accounting is applied.
Revenues from license fees are recognized based on the  method over the period from signing of the license to validation of the customers ARM-compliant product and the completion of all outstanding obligations.
The amount of revenue recognized is based on the total license fees under the license agreement, or that portion of the total license fees which is determined to be fixed or determinable in arrangements involving extended payment terms and the  achieved.
Those amounts that are not deemed fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement are recognized as the payments become due.
Where an arrangement is for multiple elements, each requiring significant production, modification or customization, the Company evaluates whether the bifurcation criteria of SOP 81-1 are met, and if so, the total arrangement fee is allocated accordingly.
The  is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project, compared with the total estimated project requirement.
Revenues are recognized only when collectability is probable.
Estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of customization, delivery and validation of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management.
Under the  method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined.
Agreements that include rights to unspecified products as opposed to unspecified upgrades and enhancements are accounted for using subscription accounting, revenue from the arrangement being recognized over the term of the arrangement, or an estimate of the economic life of the products offered if no term is specified, beginning with the delivery of the first product.
In accordance with SOP 97-2, Software revenue recognition, where agreements involve multiple elements that do not require significant production, modification or customization, the Company recognizes license revenue when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been shipped or electronically delivered, the license fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.
Where arrangements include multiple elements, the revenue recognition criteria for each element are typically met within the same accounting period, ie.
on delivery of the elements.
If an element is undelivered at a period end, the Company determines whether it has sufficient vendor specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value in order to make an allocation amongst the elements.
With the exception of post-contract support PCS and certain recharacterization services undertaken by the Companys Physical IP division, the Company does not currently believe it has sufficient VSOE to make such allocations.
Accordingly, no revenue is recognized on arrangements where deliverables other than PCS and those recharacterization services that are deemed to provide VSOE of their fair value remain outstanding.
License fees are considered fixed or determinable if they are not dependent on customers completing specific milestones and they are not subject to extended payment terms, i. e. the payment terms do not extend over a substantial period when compared to the payment terms in similar license arrangements and when compared with the licensed products life cycles.
If all the fees in an arrangement are deemed to be fixed or determinable, the Company recognizes revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
The excess of revenue recognized in respect of such fees over fees invoiced is recorded as an accrued revenue asset.
Where an arrangement includes fees that are not deemed fixed or determinable, revenue from the arrangement is recognized as the payments become due and the excess of fees invoiced over revenue recognized in respect of such fees is recorded as a deferred revenue liability.
PCS consists of an identified customer contact at the Company, and telephone or e-mail support including certain bug fixes.
PCS is generally priced separately from the initial licensing fee.
Revenue allocated to PCS is determined based on VSOE.
VSOE is determined with reference to contractual renewal rates, or, if none are specified, by reference to the rate actually charged on renewal for the same level of support and for the same or similar technologies for PCS arrangements.
PCS revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period for which support and maintenance is contractually agreed by the Company with the licensee.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 89 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Certain products have been co-developed by the Company and a collaborative partner, with both parties retaining the right to sell licenses to the product.
"In those cases where the Company makes sales of these products and considers itself to be the principal under EITF 99-19, ""Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent"", the total value of the license is recorded as revenue and the amount payable to the collaborative partner is recorded as cost of sales."
Where the collaborative partner makes sales of these products, the Company records as revenue the commission it is due when informed by the collaborative partner that a sale has been made and cash has been collected.
Sales of boards and toolkits are recognized upon delivery.
While some arrangements with distributors provide very limited rights of return, the Company's history is that actual returns are negligible and accordingly no provisions are deemed necessary.
Services, such as consulting and training are typically sold in stand-alone arrangements.
Where they are sold in conjunction with other deliverables and they are not considered essential to the functionality of those other deliverables, they are accounted for separately based on VSOE, if VSOE has been established.
Revenue for these services is recognized as the services are performed and collectability is probable.
If VSOE for the services does not exist or the services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other deliverables in the arrangement, the entire arrangement fee is recognized as the services are performed.
The excess of fees invoiced over revenue recognized in respect of such fees is recorded as a deferred revenue liability.
Revenues from consulting projects, which are typically of a short duration, are recognized when the service has been provided and all obligations to the customer under the consulting agreement have been fulfilled.
For longer term and more complex consulting projects, typically containing several project milestones, where significant modification to ARM core-based IP is required, revenues are recognized on a  basis as milestones are achieved.
This method approximates to  based on labor inputs.
Revenues are recognized when the Company receives notification from the customer of product sales, or receives payment of any fixed royalties.
Notification is typically received in the quarter following shipment of product by the customer.
Where the Company enters into more than one agreement with the same customer in the same, short time frame, an assessment is made to establish whether the group of agreements is so closely related that they effectively form a single multiple-element arrangement.
The factors considered in making this assessment include, but are not limited to: whether the different elements are closely interrelated or interdependent in terms of design, technology, or function: whether the fee for one or more of the agreements is subject to a refund or forfeiture or other concession if one of the other contracts is not completed satisfactorily: whether one or more elements in one agreement are essential to the functionality of an element in another agreement: whether payment terms under one agreement coincide with performance criteria of another agreement: and whether the negotiations are conducted jointly with two or more parties to do what in essence is a single project.
Where the Company enters into a license arrangement in exchange for a license to the customer's technology, in the absence of evidence of fair value of the arrangement, the transaction is recorded at carry-over basis.
Research and development All ongoing research and development expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Costs include salaries of engineers and associated staff, relevant EDA tools costs and other directly related expenditure, such as contractors, as well as a proportion of central facilities costs.
The facilities costs for each office are allocated according to the proportion of employees in engineering functions within these offices.
Grants Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are receivable from the European Commission, a European organization which funds certain research and development activities on application to it for the purposes of furthering research and development activities within the European Union.
The Company retains significant rights to IP developed under projects which are funded under these arrangements.
Grants received are intended to cover 50% of expected project costs.
Grant income is recognized over the period of the project in line with the costs incurred.
Unconditional undertakings have been received from the European Commission to provide the funding, and there is no obligation to refund any amounts already received.
Amounts receivable under these arrangements in the year ended 31 December 2005 were nil 2004: 338,000: 2003: 226,000 and were netted against related research and development costs.
Pension costs The Company contributes to defined contribution plans substantially covering all employees in Europe and the US and to government pension schemes for employees in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, PR China and Israel.
The Company contributes to these plans based upon various fixed percentages of employee compensation and such contributions are expensed as incurred.
The amount of contributions expensed by the Company for the years ended 31 December 2003, 2004 and 2005 were 1,848,000, 2,067,000 and 3,371,000 respectively.
Loss contingencies The Company accrues an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
Cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Short-term investments and marketable securities The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of greater than three months but less than one year to be either short-term investments when invested on deposit with major clearing banks or short-term marketable securities when custodied with major financial institutions.
Any investments with a maturity date of greater than one year are classified as long-term marketable securities.
90 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Allowance for doubtful debts Allowance is made for doubtful debts following reviews of individual customer circumstances by management.
Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
In general, cost is determined on a first-in-first-out basis and includes transport and handling costs.
Property and equipment The cost of property and equipment is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Costs that are directly attributable to the development of new business application software and which are incurred during the period prior to the date that the software is placed into operational use, are capitalized.
External costs and internal costs are capitalized to the extent they enhance the future economic benefit of the business.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of property and equipment, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
The principal economic lives used for this purpose are: Freehold buildings 25 years Leasehold improvements Five years or term of lease, whichever is shorter Computers and software Three to five years Fixtures and fittings Five to ten years Motor vehicles Four years Provision is made against the carrying value of property and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Currency translation The functional currency for the Companys operations is the local currency in which each operation operates.
The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Statements of income of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the monthly exchange rates during the year.
Translation differences are taken to the cumulative translation adjustment.
The Company utilizes forward exchange contracts and currency options to manage the exchange risk on actual transactions related to accounts receivable, denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the business.
The Companys forward exchange contracts do not subject the Company to risk from exchange rate movements because the gains and losses on such contracts offset losses and gains, respectively, on the transactions being hedged.
Because the Company does not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, the forward and option contracts and the related accounts receivable are recorded at fair value at each period end.
All recognized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of the contracts are recorded within general and administrative costs in the income statement.
The fair value of derivative instruments are disclosed within either prepaid expenses and other assets or accrued liabilities on the balance sheet and within net cash provided by operating activities in the cash flow statement.
The Company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging anticipated transactions.
Other transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of transaction.
Exchange differences have been included in general and administrative costs.
From time to time, the Company enters into sales contracts denominated in a currency typically US dollars that is neither the functional currency of the Company nor the functional currency of the customer.
In accordance with SFAS 133, Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, where there are unpaid amounts on such contracts, the Company carries such derivatives at fair value.
The resulting gain or loss is recognized in the income statement under general and administrative costs.
Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the asset will not be realized.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Diluted earnings per common share is computed by including potential common shares where the effect of their inclusion would be dilutive.
The diluted share base for the year ended 31 December 2005 excludes incremental shares of approximately 39,614,000 2004: 38,143,000: 2003: 18,948,000 related to employee stock options.
These shares are excluded due to their antidilutive effect as a result of the exercise price of these shares being higher than the market price.
The ordinary equivalent shares for share options were determined using the treasury stock method.
Accounting for stock-based compensation The Company has elected to use the intrinsic value-based method to account for all its employee stock-based compensation plans, under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for stock issued to employees, and related interpretations.
Stock-based employee compensation cost in respect of certain SAYE options see below of 417,000 2004: 341,000: 2003: 310,000, in respect of the LTIP of 3,814,000 2004: 619,000: 2003: 241,000 and in respect of stock options issued as part of a business combination of 5,496,000 2004: nil: 2003: nil is reflected in net income.
Approximately 3.2 million of the charge for the LTIP in 2005 was due to an increase in the number of awards that were expected to vest, predominantly from the 2003 scheme, due to an improvement in the Companys total shareholder return compared to ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 91 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued the comparator groups in the year.
No compensation cost is recorded in respect of the other stock option plans, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.
Apart from certain options issued to executive directors, there are no performance conditions attached to the exercise of options.
For executive directors, discretionary share options of up to two times base salary may be issued each year that will vest after seven years.
If, however, the Company achieves defined levels of EPS growth above the rate of inflation over a period of three years, then the options are exercisable after three years.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No.
123, Accounting for stock-based compensation, to stock-based employee compensation.

The Company operates Save As You Earn SAYE schemes in the UK and an Employee Share Purchase Plan ESPP in the US.
The UK SAYE schemes are approved by the Inland Revenue, which stipulates that the savings period must be at least 36 months.
During 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a consensus, contained within EITF 00-23, that savings plans which have a savings period in excess of 27 months should be treated as compensatory.
In accordance with EITF 00-23, which applies to new offers after 24 January 2002, the Company has recognized a compensation charge in respect of the UK SAYE plans offered since that date.
In addition, the EITF reached a consensus that an employers offer to enter into a new SAYE contract at a lower price than an existing contract causes variable accounting for all existing awards subject to the offer.
Variable accounting commences for all existing awards when the offer is made, and for those awards that are retained by employees because the offer is declined, variable accounting continues until the awards are exercised, are forfeited, or expire unexercised.
New awards are accounted for as variable to the extent that previous higher priced options are canceled.
The compensation charge recorded in 2005 as a result of these provisions is 206,000 2004: 115,000: 2003: 109,000.
The number of options to which variable accounting applies is approximately 867,000 2004: 908,000: 2003: 950,000.
The Company has an LTIP on which it is also required to recognize a compensation charge calculated as the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the period end, over the vesting period of the share awards.
As part of the consideration for Artisan, the Company granted approximately 90.4 million options over shares in ARM Holdings plc to employees of Artisan with substantially the same terms of those enjoyed when they were options over Artisan shares.
As a result, a significant proportion of the options were already vested at acquisition.
The intrinsic value of the unvested options was recorded as reduction in shareholders' funds and a reduction in goodwill.
This amount is then charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period of the options.
Treasury stock Treasury stock represents the cost of shares in the Company held by the Company, the Employee Benefit Trust ESOP and the QUEST.
During 2005, to supplement the payment of dividends to shareholders, the Company began a rolling share buyback programme under the shareholder authority conferred at the 2005 Annual General Meeting.
The quantum and frequency of share repurchases is not predetermined and will take into account prevailing market conditions, the short-to-medium-term cash needs of the business and the level of employee share-based remuneration going forward.
92 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued In 2005, a total of 13,868,000 shares were repurchased in the market at a cost of 16,211,000.
At 31 December 2005, there were 12,751,107 shares in the Company still held from these purchases with a market value of 15,429,000.
The ESOP was set up on 16 April 1998 to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of employees.
Under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan, 7,760,881 shares could be awarded from shares already issued within the ESOP and treasury stock held by the Company.
The market value of unearned shares at 31 December 2005 was 6,050,000.
All costs relating to the schemes are recognized in the income statement as they accrue and the ESOP has waived the right to receive dividends of over and above 0.01 pence per share on all shares held.
For the purpose of earnings per share calculations, the shares are treated as canceled until such time as they vest unconditionally.
The Company also has a QUEST which was established to acquire new shares in the Company for the benefit of employees and directors of the Company.
No shares were purchased in 2005, 2004 or 2003.
During 2005, 713,034 shares 2004: 8,046 were allocated from the QUEST following the exercise of share options granted under the Companys SAYE schemes.
Under the terms of the trust deed, dividends have been waived on the shares held by the QUEST, and all costs relating to the scheme are dealt with in the income statement as they accrue.
Following the allocations in 2005, the QUEST held no further shares in the Company and is in the process of being wound-up.
Employers taxes on share options Employers National Insurance in the UK and equivalent taxes in other jurisdictions are payable on the exercise of certain share options issued to employees in certain tax jurisdictions.
In accordance with EITF 00-16 no provision has been made for the employers taxes on these share options.
These amounts are recognized in the consolidated income statement when payable.
Recently issued accounting standards In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
123R will require the Company to expense share-based payments, including employee stock options, based on their fair value.
123R permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods.
The first adoption method is a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date i based on the requirements of SFAS No.
123R for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and ii based on the requirements of SFAS No.
123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No.
123R that remain unvested on the effective date.
The second adoption method is a modified retrospective method, which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate, based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No.
123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures, either i all prior periods presented or ii prior interim periods in the year of adoption.
ARM is required to adopt SFAS No.
123R effective as of 1 January 2006, and plans to utilize the modified prospective method of adoption.
123, the Company currently accounts for share-based payments to employees under APB No.
25 using the intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options except the LTIP and SAYE Schemes.
Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No.
123Rs fair value method will have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations, although it will have no impact on the Companys overall financial position.
The impact of adoption of SFAS No.
123R cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the future.
However, had the Company adopted SFAS No.
123R in prior years, the impact of that adoption would have approximated the impact of SFAS No.
123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and pro forma earnings per share.
123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as currently presented.
This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption and, upon adoption in 2006, the Company will restate its prior consolidated statements of cash flows to reflect this classification.
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No.
153 FAS 153 Exchanges of non-monetary assets an amendment of APB opinion No.
29 Accounting for non-monetary transactions APB 29.
FAS 153 is based on the principle that non-monetary asset exchanges should be recorded and measured at the fair value of the assets exchanged, with certain exceptions.
This standard requires exchanges of productive assets to be accounted for at fair value, rather than at carryover basis, unless i neither the asset received nor the asset surrendered has a fair value that is determinable within reasonable limits or ii the transactions lack commercial substance as defined.
In addition, the FASB decided to retain the guidance in APB 29 for assessing whether the fair value of a non-monetary asset is determinable within reasonable limits.
The new standard is the result of the convergence project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
We will adopt this standard for non-monetary asset exchanges beginning in 2006.
The adoption of FAS 153 is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 Accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations FIN 47 which clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No.
143 Accounting for asset retirement obligations SFAS No.
143, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity.
FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated.
FIN 47 was effective as of 31 December 2005, and has had no impact on the consolidated results.
In May 2005, the FASB issued FASB Statement No.
154 Accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of APB opinion No.
20 Accounting changes and SFAS No.
3 Reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements required the inclusion of the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle in net income of the period of the change.
154 requires companies to recognize a change in accounting principle, including a change required by a new accounting pronouncement when the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions, retrospectively to prior periods financial statements.
ARM will assess the impact of a retrospective application of a change in accounting principle in accordance with SFAS No.
154 when such a change arises after the effective date of 1 January 2006.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 93 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued In November 2005, FASB finalized FSP FAS 115-1 The meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments.
The FSP provides guidance on the recognition of impairments deemed other-than-temporary.
FSP 115-1 is effective for other-than-temporary impairment analysis conducted in periods beginning after 15 December 2005.
We believe that our current policy on other-than-temporary impairments complies with FSP 115-1.
Accordingly, the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Companies Act 1985 These financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 240 of the Companies Act 1985 of Great Britain the Companies Act.
The Companys statutory accounts, which are its primary financial statements, are prepared in accordance with International Financing Reporting Standards IFRS for consolidated accounts and accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom UK GAAP for ARM Holdings plc company-only accounts.
They are prepared in compliance with the Companies Act and are presented in pounds sterling.
Statutory accounts upon which the auditors gave unqualified reports under Section 235 of the Companies Act and which did not contain statements under sub-sections 237 2 and 3 of the Companies Act for the years ended 31 December 2003 and 2004 have been, and those for the year ended 31 December 2005 will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales.
Dividends are required to be declared in sterling out of profits available for that purpose as determined in accordance with UK GAAP and the Companies Act.

nil was owed by CSR at 31 December 2005 2004: nil.
Such benefits are reflected as additional paid-in capital.
Also included in the provision for income taxes is utilization of the deferred tax liability in relation to acquired intangibles of 6,921,000 2004: 188,000: 2003: nil.
94 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 3 Income taxes continued Total income tax expense differs from the amounts computed by applying the UK statutory income tax rate of 30% for 2005, 2004 and 2003 to income before income tax as a result of the following: Year ended 31 December 2003 2004 2005 000 000 000 UK statutory rate 30% 2004: 30%: 2003: 30% 6,588 11,537 15,970 Permanent differences other 1,803 177 2,527 Amortization of intangibles 188 1,730 Differences in statutory rates of foreign countries 92 231 45 Other, net 460 1,279 314 8,943 10,478 11,354 Permanent differences comprise permanent adjustments and the UK research and development tax credit.
Other, net comprises prior year adjustments, timing differences and deferred tax adjustments.
Significant components of the deferred tax assets liabilities are as follows: At 31 December 2003 2004 2005 000 000 000 Fixed asset temporary differences 2,844 5,669 5,214 Temporary difference on available-for-sale securities 446 2,077 1,096 Non-deductible accruals and reserves 429 1,592 1,662 Amounts relating to intangible assets arising on acquisition 28,571 28,323 Losses carried forward 815 13,825 20,042 Total deferred tax assets liabilities 3,642 9,562 2,501 Valuation allowance 503 254 366 Net deferred tax assets liabilities 3,139 9,816 2,867 Disclosed on the balance sheet within: Year ended 31 December 2003 2004 2005 000 000 000 Assets 3,139 2,529 4,422 Liabilities 12,345 7,289 Net deferred tax assets liabilities 3,139 9,816 2,867 Included in the amounts relating to intangible assets on acquisition is 20,925,000 2004: 22,150,000 relating to liabilities that are expected to accrue after more than one year.
UK income taxes have not been provided at 31 December 2005 on unremitted earnings of approximately 14,958,000 2004: 5,670,000: 2003: 6,891,000 of subsidiaries located outside the UK as such earnings are considered to be permanently invested.
If these earnings were to be remitted without offsetting tax credits in the UK, withholding taxes would be approximately 2,379,000 2004: 1,122,000: 2003: 347,000.
The valuation allowance relates to net operating loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries, where management believes it is more likely than not such amounts will not be realized.
None of the loss carryforwards expires before 2018.
The future use of the net operating losses carried forward in ARM Inc. may be restricted in the event of a purchase by a third party, whereby the level of losses to be utilized on an annual basis would be limited to 4% of the market value of ARM Inc. at the date of the transaction.
As at 31 December 2005 the Company had federal net operating losses of 26,808,000 and a deferred tax asset thereon of 9,115,000.
These losses begin to expire in 2023.
The Company also had state net operating losses of 16,816,000 and a deferred tax asset of 808,000 which begin to expire in 2013.
In addition to the net operating losses the Company also had unutilized federal R&D tax credits of 4,105,000 which will begin to expire in 2012 and unutilized state R&D tax credits of 4,388,000 which have no expiration date.

Significant technological changes in the industry could affect operating results.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk comprise principally cash, cash equivalents, shortand long-term investments and marketable securities and accounts receivable.
The Company generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable, as many of the Companys customers are large, well-established companies.
The Company has not experienced any significant losses related to individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area.
The Company markets and sells to a relatively small number of customers with individually large value transactions.
For further information see footnote 13.
At 31 December 2003, 2004 and 2005, no customers accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable.
At 31 December 2004 and 2005, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, shortand long-term investments and marketable securities were deposited with major clearing banks and building societies in the UK and US in the form of money market deposits and corporate bonds for varying periods up to two years.
6 Acquisitions Keil Elektronik GmbH and Keil Software Inc. On 27 October 2005, the Company purchased the entire share capital of Keil Elektronik GmbH KEG, a company incorporated in Germany for total consideration of $10.9 million 6.1 million, comprising $10.4 million cash consideration and $0.5 million of related acquisition expenses.
On the same day, the Company purchased the entire share capital of Keil Software Inc. KSI, a US company, for total consideration of $5.2 million 2.9 million, comprising $5.0 million cash consideration and $0.2 million of related acquisition expenses.
96 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 6 Acquisitions continued The Company has identified the MCU market as a critical growth area for the Companys future business and with this acquisition, the Company will be able to accelerate progress in that market by offering a more complete solution.
As the MCU applications shift from 8 16-bit to 32-bit solutions, the combination of the ARM Cortex-M3 processor, which was specifically designed for microcontroller applications, the RealView high-performance compiler, and Keils complementary MCU tools for ARM, will enable new generations of ARM MCU solutions.
The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.
A further $2.3 million for KEG and $1.0 million for KSI is potentially payable on the achievement of various post-acquisition financial milestones and will be accrued when payable.
Keil is a leading independent provider of software development tools for the microcontoller MCU market.
The operating results for Keil have been included in these financial statements for the period from 27 October 2005 to 31 December 2005.
The acquisition was accounted for under SFAS 141.

These intangibles were identified and valued through interviews and analysis of data provided by Keil concerning development projects, their stage of development, the time and resources needed to complete them, and if applicable, their expected income generating ability.
There were no other contractual or other legal rights of Keil clearly identifiable by management, other than those identified below.
The provisional allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows: KEG KSI Useful estimated life years 000 000 Fair value of net liabilities assets acquired 402 161 Intangible assets acquired: Customer relationships 2-3 4,290 482 Developed technology 1-5 2,744 Trade names 5 1,175 Deferred tax liability 2,673 663 Goodwill 2,178 1,764 Purchase price 6,137 2,919 KEG made a profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 1.0 million and for the period from 1 January 2005 until acquisition a profit after tax of 1.0 million.
The results of the Company would not have been significantly different had the acquisition of KEG and KSI occurred on 1 January 2005.
Axys Design Automation Inc. On 16 August 2004, the Company purchased the entire share capital of Axys Design Automation Inc. a US company, for total consideration of $12.5 million 6.9 million, comprising $11.6 million cash consideration and $0.9 million of related acquisition expenses.

There were no other contractual or other legal rights of Axys clearly identifiable by management, other than those identified below.
The allocation of the purchase price, as at 31 December 2004, to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows: Useful estimated life years 000 Fair value of net assets acquired 465 Intangible assets acquired: Developed technology 5 1,379 Customer relationships 5 425 Trademarks 596 In-process research and development 383 Deferred tax liability 760 Goodwill 4,914 Purchase price 6,902 Axys profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2003 was 0.02 million and for the period from 1 January 2004 until acquisition was a loss of 0.9 million.
As noted above, a further $3 million consideration was paid during 2005 following the achievement of various post-acquisition financial milestones.
As a result, total consideration and resultant goodwill increased by 1,690,000 during the year, as reflected in note 9.
Artisan Components Inc. On 23 December 2004, the Company acquired the entire share capital of Artisan Components Inc. a leading provider of physical IP components for the design and manufacture of complex system-on-chip SoC integrated circuits.
The acquisition enables the combined company to deliver one of the industrys broadest portfolios of SoC intellectual property to their extensive, combined customer base, with highly complementary sales channels combining ARMs channel to more than 170 silicon manufacturers with Artisans channel to more than 2,000 companies.
It better positions the combined company to benefit from growth opportunities across multiple industries as system design complexity increases, and strengthens the links between the key aspects of SoC development, enabling the combined company to deliver solutions that are further optimized for power and performance.
The operating results for Artisan have been included in these financial statements for the period 23 December 2004 to 31 December 2004 in the 2004 comparatives and for the entire year in 2005.
The total consideration paid was $926.9 million 481.7 million, comprising cash of $235.4 million 122.3 million, 324,399,411 ordinary shares in the Company with a fair value of $524.2 million 272.4 million, approximately 90.4 million share options issued to existing Artisan employees with fair value of $151.9 million 79.0 million and related direct acquisition fees of $15.4 million 8.0 million including legal, valuation and accounting fees.
These provisional fair values were subsequently amended during 2005 as noted below.
The shares issued in the acquisition were valued in accordance with Emerging Issues Take Force Issue No.
99-12 EITF 99-12, Determination of the measurement date for the market price of acquirer securities issued in a purchase business combination.
In accordance with EITF 99-12, the Company established the first date on which the number of the Company shares and the amount of other consideration became fixed as of 23 August 2004.
Accordingly the Company valued the transaction using the average closing price of the Companys ordinary shares two days before and after 23 August 98 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 6 Acquisitions continued 2004, or $1.616 per share.
The assumed options to acquire ordinary shares were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model with volatility of between 80% and 94%, an average risk-free interest rate of 4.5%, an estimated life of between zero and six years, and dividend yield of 0.7%.
The following table sets out the provisional fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition as reported in the 2004 annual report: Fair value to Company 000 Assets: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 82,567 Accounts receivable, net 15,078 Prepaid expenses and other assets 3,225 Deferred tax asset 15,446 Property and equipment, net 2,509 Total assets acquired 118,825 Liabilities: Accounts payable and other creditors 3,674 Accrued and other liabilities 13,245 Deferred revenue 6,545 Total liabilities assumed 23,464 Net assets acquired 95,361 The intangible assets recognized, apart from goodwill, represented contractual or other legal rights of Artisan and those intangible assets of Artisan that could be clearly identified.
These intangibles were identified and valued through interviews and analysis of data provided by Artisan concerning development projects, their stage of development, the time and resources needed to complete them, and if applicable, their expected income-generating ability.
There were no other contractual or other legal rights of Artisan clearly identifiable by management, other than those identified below.
The provisional allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows: Useful estimated life years 000 Fair value of net assets acquired 95,361 Intangible assets acquired: Developed technology 4 5 18,177 Patents core technology 5 7 11,719 Existing agreements and customer relationships 3 8 36,354 Trademarks tradenames 4 5 2,500 Order backlog 0 1 1,354 In-process research and development 3,229 Deferred stock-based compensation 9,579 Deferred tax liability 28,042 Goodwill 331,432 Purchase price 481,663 Developed technology Developed technology of 18.2 million and patents and core technology of 11.7 million included intellectual property components for use in SoC integrated circuits and consisted of the following: embedded memory, standard cell, input output components, and analog and mixed-signal products.
To estimate the fair value of the developed technology, an income approach was used with a discount rate of 14% for existing technology and 16% for patents and core technology, which included an analysis of future cash flows and the risks associated with achieving such cash flows.
All developed technologies are being amortized over the estimated useful lives of four to five years.
Existing agreements and customer relationships and order backlog The customer base of 36.4 million and order backlog of 1.4 million represented the fair value of existing customer relationships and contracts, royalty arrangements, and support and maintenance agreements.
The customer base and order backlog are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of three to six years for customer base and one year for order backlog.
Trademarks and tradenames The fair value assigned to trademarks and tradenames, including the company name Artisan, was estimated using the income approach, which discounts the present value of attributable cash flows at a discount rate of 16%.
In-process research and development Development projects that had reached technological feasibility were classified as developed technology and the value assigned to developed technology was capitalized.
Expensed in-process research and development of 3.2 million reflected certain research projects ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 99 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 6 Acquisitions continued that had not yet reached technological feasibility and commercial viability or had no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition.
The fair value assigned to in-process research and development was estimated using the income approach, which discounts to present value the cash flows attributable to the technology once it has reached technological feasibility using a discount rate of 19%.
In-process research and development has been written-off immediately to the income statement.
Goodwill of 331.4 million represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible sets acquired.
As stated, the acquisition enables the combined company to deliver one of the industry's broadest portfolios of SoC intellectual property to their extensive, combined customer base and it better positions the combined company to benefit from growth opportunities across multiple industries as system design complexity increases.
These, combined with the ability to hire the entire Artisan work force, were significant contributing factors to the establishment of the purchase price, resulting in the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill.
In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company is not amortizing goodwill relating to the acquisition.
It is being carried at cost and the Company will test it for impairment annually and whenever events indicate that an impairment may have occurred.
The pro forma results of the Company for the current year, had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2004, and for the prior year, had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2003, would have been: 2003 2004 Unaudited Unaudited 000 000 Revenues 173,277 197,852 Income from operations 3,730 15,973 Net income 1,650 16,365 Diluted earnings per ordinary share 0.1p 1.2p Net income has been reduced in these pro forma results in relation to reduced interest income as a result of the cash portion of the acquisition consideration, amortization of intangibles acquired and amortization of deferred compensation.
During 2005, the provisional fair values were adjusted resulting in an increase in the net assets acquired of $2.9 million 1.5 million with a corresponding decrease to goodwill.
The principal adjustments were an increase to the deferred tax asset representing deductions arising on exercise of options issued in a business combination, in accordance with EITF00-23 of 4.8 million, an increase in intangible assets acquired including in-process research and development but net of deferred tax of 0.8 million, a reduction in deferred tax assets relating to carried forward losses of 1.4 million, and additional provisions for unaccrued costs of 2.7 million.
See note 9 for subsequent revisions to acquired intangible assets on finalization of the purchase price allocation.

Until the adoption of SFAS 142 on 1 January 2002 see footnote 1, goodwill was being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of up to three years, determined in each case by reference to employee turnover rates in the industry and the individual technology acquired with the acquisitions.
In accordance with SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer amortized, and is tested for impairment at least annually.
The split of goodwill by segment is shown in note 14.
Additions in the year relating to KEG, KSI and Axys have all been allocated to the Processor division.
The foreign exchange difference arises as goodwill on Artisan, Axys and KSI is denominated in US dollars and thus is subject to revaluation at the period-end rates.
Changes in the carrying amount for the year are as follows: Processor division Physical IP division Total 000 000 000 Balance at 1 January 2005 108,414 232,002 340,416 Additions KEG 2,178 2,178 Additions KSI 1,764 1,764 Additions Axys 1,690 1,690 Revisions Artisan 956 2,231 3,187 Exchange differences 13,285 29,426 42,711 Balance at 31 December 2005 126,375 259,197 385,572 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 101 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 9 Intangible assets continued Licenses to use technology are being amortized over periods of three to five years.
The amortization periods for licenses have been determined according to their estimated useful economic life.
Patents are being amortized over four to five years, developed technology the main IP of the company existent at acquisition and generating revenue over five years and customer relationships relationships with customers which were generating revenue at acquisition over two years, being the periods over which the Company is expected to derive benefit from them.
The estimated amortization expense of intangible assets in each of the next five years is set forth below: 000 2006 18,634 2007 18,519 2008 17,077 2009 10,216 2010 6,780 10 Accounts receivable Included within accounts receivable at 31 December 2005 are 20.5 million 2004: 5.9 million of amounts recoverable on contracts.
11 Accrued liabilities Included within accrued liabilities at 31 December 2005 are nil million 2004: 14.3 million of acquisition-related expenses, 0.7 million 2004: 4.4 million for staff costs and 0.7 million 2004: 2.8 million representing the fair value of embedded derivatives.
12 Shareholders equity Share options The board is authorized to issue options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum of 10% of the issued ordinary share capital in any five-year period.
Options issued prior to the listing of the Company are excluded from this calculation.
Various options to directors under the Unapproved Scheme have certain performance criteria attached, which if met are exerciseable after three years, otherwise they will become exerciseable after seven years.
"The schemes assumed were the ""1993 Plan"", the ""1997 Plan"", the ""2000 Plan"", the ""2003 Plan"", the ""Director Plan"", the ""Executive Plan"" and the ""ND00 Plan""."
In 1998, the Company set up two savings-related share option schemes for all employees and executive directors of the Company.
The Company set up further savings-related option schemes in each year up to and including 2005 for all employees and executive directors of the Company, which have the same characteristics as those schemes set up in 1998.
The weighted average exercise price of options exercisable at 31 December 2005 was 1.22 2004: 1.00: 2003: 2.45.
These shares will be awarded from shares already issued within the ESOP and other treasury shares.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 103 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 13 Commitments and contingencies The Company leases its office facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating lease agreements which expire at various dates through 2018.

In May 2002, Nazomi Communications, Inc. Nazomi filed suit against ARM alleging willful infringement of Nazomis US Patent No.
The obligation for the Company to indemnify its licensees is subject to certain provisos and is usually contingent upon a third party bringing an action against the licensee alleging that the technology licensed by the Company to the licensee infringes such third party's intellectual property rights.
The indemnification obligations typically survive any termination of the license and will continue in perpetuity.
The total provision for such guarantees was nil million on 31 December 2005 2004: 0.5 million, and a table showing the movement of the provision during the year is as follows: Utilized in the At 1 January Provided in the year Released in year through At 31 December 2005 on new claims the year cash payments 2005 000 000 000 000 000 Indemnification provision 520 520 At 31 December 2005, ARM had provided in aggregate 0.8 million 2004: 1.3 million in relation to legal matters, being the expected future costs to be incurred.
At 31 December 2005, the Company had outstanding purchase commitments of 1,371,000 2004: 1,179,000.
104 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 14 Geographic and segment information The directors are of the opinion that the Company had only one class of business during 2004 and before, but that following the acquisition of Artisan Components Inc. in December 2004, the Company now has two reportable business segments, namely the Processor division and the Physical IP division.
Although the Chief Operating Decision Maker and the rest of the board are provided with analyses of revenues by the different revenue streams licensing, royalties, development systems and services, costs, operating results and balance sheet items are only analyzed into two divisions, namely Processors and Physical IP.
As such these are currently the only two reportable segments.
The Physical IP division consists of the business stream previously undertaken by Artisan and the revenues from the Physical IP division are derived from the sale of legacy Artisan products and services.
The Processor divisions revenues comprise legacy ARM products and services, including those from development systems products, including those of Axys.
During the year, the Company acquired Keil Elektronik GmbH and Keil Software Inc. and both have been included within the Processor division.
The results of each segment have been prepared using consistent accounting policies with those of the Company as a whole.
The following analysis is of revenues by geographic segment and origin and long-lived assets, excluding deferred tax assets, by Group companies in each territory: Year ended 31 December 2003 2004 2005 000 000 000 Revenues by market destination : Europe 23,118 23,837 32,971 US 65,402 77,457 99,727 Japan 24,135 32,754 42,270 Asia Pacific excluding Japan 15,415 18,849 57,471 Total revenues 128,070 152,897 232,439 The Companys exports from the UK were 115,072,000, 138,078,000 and 172,592,000 for the years ended 31 December 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 105 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 15 Fair values of financial instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that value: Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
Long-term marketable securities The carrying amount approximates fair value because these instruments are marked-to-market.
Foreign currency forward contracts The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts and embedded derivatives is estimated using the settlement rates prevailing at the period end.
The estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments are as follows: At 31 December 2004 2005 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value 000 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 110,561 110,561 128,077 128,077 Short-term investments 5,307 5,307 23,990 23,990 Marketable securities 26,949 26,949 8,835 8,835 Accounts receivable 34,347 34,347 55,518 55,518 Foreign currency contracts 1,674 1,674 1,708 1,708 Embedded derivatives 2,823 2,823 722 722 16 Valuation and qualifying accounts Charged Acquired with Balance at credited to subsidiary Foreign Balance at 1 January income statement undertaking exchange 31 December 000 000 000 000 000 2005 allowance for doubtful debts 1,451 547 27 148 2,173 2004 allowance for doubtful debts 1,115 321 657 1,451 2003 allowance for doubtful debts 2,193 1,078 1,115 17 Post balance sheet events At the 2006 Annual General Meeting of the Company, a final dividend of 0.5 pence per share total cost 6,842,000 will be proposed in respect of the 2005 financial year, and if approved will be paid on 5 May 2006 to shareholders on the register at 31 March 2006.

A summary of the more important accounting policies, which have been consistently applied and reviewed by the board of directors in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 18, Accounting policies, is set out below together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Changes in accounting standards The Company has adopted FRS 20 Share-based payments, FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date, FRS 22 Earnings per share, FRS 23 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, FRS 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation, FRS 26 Financial instruments: Measurement and FRS 28 Corresponding amounts in these financial statements.
The adoption of each of these standards represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
Details of the effect of the prior-year adjustments are given in note 8.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are initially recorded at cost.
Where an acquisition satisfied the provisions of sections 131 to 134 of the Companies Act 1985 for merger relief, the investment is stated at the nominal value of shares issued plus the fair value of any other consideration.
Short-term investments Bank deposits which are not repayable on demand are treated as short-term investments.
Cash flow statement The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 1 Revised 1996 Cash flow statements which provides that where a company is a member of a group and a consolidated cash flow statement is published, the company does not have to prepare a cash flow statement.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Exchange differences have been included in operating profit.
Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments The Company does not have any financial instruments.
Share schemes The Groups Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP and Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST are separately administered trusts which are funded by loans the ESOP and loans and gifts the QUEST from the Group, and the assets of which comprise shares in the Company.
In accordance with UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP trusts, the Company recognises the assets and liabilities of the ESOP and the QUEST in its own accounts and shares held by the trusts are recorded at cost as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds until such time as the shares vest unconditionally to employees.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments, including an LTIP, to certain employees of subsidiary undertakings.
In accordance with FRS 20, equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The Company has recognised a compensation charge in respect of the UK SAYE plans and US ESPPs.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available, and has applied the provisions of FRS 20 only to those options granted after 7 November 2002 and which were outstanding at 31 December 2004.
The Company does not have any employees and as such all share-based compensation has been recharged to subsidiary undertakings by way of capital contributions to those subsidiaries.
Treasury shares The Company has a share buyback programme under which the Company purchases its own shares and holds them as treasury shares.
These shares will be used to satisfy employee share option exercises.
In accordance with UITF 38, the Company recognises these shares at cost as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds.
2 Profit for the financial year As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the parent companys profit and loss account has not been included in these financial statements.
The parent companys profit after taxation, including dividends receivable and before dividends payable was 19,908,000 2004: 17,279,000.
Apart from seven directors who have contracts of service with ARM Limited, the Company has no employees.
