ASSETS SUBJECT TO NON-RECOURSE FINANCE Prior to its acquisition by the Group, certain loans originated by Mortgage Trust Limited had been sold to companies, ultimately beneficially owned by charitable trusts, which had raised non-recourse finance to fund these purchases.
The Group is not obliged to support any losses of these companies and does not intend to do so.
This is clearly stated in the terms and conditions under which the finance was raised, which provide that the finance providers will receive interest and repayment of principal only to the extent that sufficient funds are generated by the mortgage portfolios acquired by each company.
The priority and amount of claims on the proceeds generated by the assets are determined in accordance with a strict priority of payments.
The Group receives net income from the mortgages after the claims of the finance providers have been satisfied in full.
The finance providers have no recourse to the Group in any form.
