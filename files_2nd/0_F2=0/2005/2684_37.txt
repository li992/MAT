Towards the end of 2005, this group was transferred to the UK.
The movement of these personnel to and from Other during the year has led to the overall increase in the average number of employees within Other 2005 compared with 2004.
The aggregate remuneration and associated costs of Group employees, including amounts capitalised, were: 2005 2004 2003 m m m Salaries and wages 505 675 895 Social security costs 44 61 71 Pension costs Principal schemes Note 8 23 24 31 Other costs including defined contribution schemes 13 26 32 585 786 1,029 7 Directors remuneration and shareholdings Information covering Directors remuneration including pension entitlements, interest in shares and interests in share options including in each case those arising under the Share Option Plan, Restricted Shares and Performance Share Plan is included in the Directors remuneration report on pages 41 to 53.
8 Pensions Defined benefit schemes The Company and its principal subsidiaries operate pension and other retirement schemes that cover the majority of employees of the Group.
These schemes include both the defined benefit type, whereby retirement benefits are based on the employees final remuneration and length of service, and defined contribution schemes, whereby retirement benefits reflect the accumulated value of agreed contributions paid by, and in respect of, employees.
With the exception of the unfunded, unapproved retirement benefit schemes, the remaining schemes are funded through separate trustee administered schemes.
Contributions to the defined benefit schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of independent actuaries who value the schemes at regular intervals, usually triennially.
An actuarial valuation of the principal United Kingdom defined benefit pension scheme the Scheme was prepared at 31 March 2002 for the purpose of UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for pension costs SSAP 24.
The valuation of the Scheme disclosed a shortfall in the market value of the Schemes assets compared with the accrued liabilities.
This was principally due to the fall in the Schemes asset values following the fall in global equity markets between 1 April 1999 and 31 March 2002.
Thus, with agreement from the actuary, the Company increased its contributions to the Scheme to 20 per cent of salary with effect from 1 April 2002, and made a contribution to Performance Notes to the financial statements the Scheme of 47 million in December 2002 in respect of the shortfall.
The latest actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme is in progress, based on the position at 31 March 2005.
The Group contributed 100 million in February 2005 to the UK fund in anticipation of this valuation.
The Scheme was valued using the projected unit method and the principal assumptions were that future investment returns on existing assets would, on average, be 3.2 per cent a year above the level of price inflation, that the return on new investments would be 3.9 per cent a year above price inflation, that general salary growth would be 1.7 per cent a year above price inflation, and that inflation related pension increases would generally be in line with price inflation.
The market value of the Schemes investments at the valuation date was 1,401 million.
The Scheme also holds some insurance policies, which had an assessed value of 11 million.
The total value of the assets was 97 per cent of the value of the aggregate benefits that had accrued to members of the Scheme, allowing for expected future earnings increases in the case of employees.
The assumptions used for calculating the pension cost for accounting purposes differ from the funding assumptions in that the assumed return on existing assets is 3.3 per cent a year above price inflation.
In the Financial Statements, the deficit in the Scheme is spread over the remaining service lives of the employed members.
Under those assumptions as at 31 March 2002, the total value of the investments was 99 per cent of the value of the aggregate benefits that had accrued to members of the Scheme.
The principal pension costs as shown in Note 6 comprise: 2005 2004 2003 m m m Regular costs 17 17 22 Variation from regular costs including interest 6 79 23 24 31 Pension schemes other than the Scheme are accounted for on the basis of local custom and practice.
Pension prepayments relating to the Scheme of 202 million 2004 102 million, 2003 112 million are included in other prepayments and accrued income Note 19.
Provisions for obligations to pay terminal gratuities on retirement to staff who are not members of the pension and retirement schemes are included in provisions for pensions Note 22.
Defined contribution schemes The pension cost for the year for the defined contribution schemes was 13 million 2004 26 million, 2003 19 million.
Disclosures in respect of FRS 17 Retirement benefits The above figures have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of SSAP 24.
FRS 17 has been published in the United Kingdom, however, its full introduction has been deferred.
The accounting requirements of FRS 17 are broadly as follows: pension scheme assets are valued at market values at the balance sheet date: pension scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality AA corporate bonds of equivalent term and currency to the liability: for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 the pension scheme surplus to the extent it is considered recoverable or deficit will be recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet: and the movement in the scheme surplus deficit will be split between operating charges, financing items and, in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, actuarial gains and losses.
The transitional disclosures in respect of FRS 17 are set out below: 114 115 2005 Annual Report Qualified independent actuaries, Watson Wyatt LLP, updated the actuarial valuations of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 March 2005.
The main financial assumptions in accordance with FRS 17 are as follows: At 31 March 2005 At 31 March 2004 At 31 March 2003 Rest of Rest of Rest of UK Group UK Group UK Group %%%%%% Inflation assumption 2.7 3.9 2.8 3.8 2.5 4.3 Rate of increase in salaries 3.2 5.9 4.6 5.4 4.3 5.6 Pension increases 2.7-3.0 2.9 2.8-3.0 3.5 2.5-3.0 3.6 Discount rate 5.4 7.2 5.5 6.4 5.5 6.9 Long term expected rate of return on: Equities 8.0 8.3 8.0 9.0 8.5 9.1 Bonds 4.9 6.2 5.0 6.6 5.0 7.1 Property 6.5 5.2 Other 4.0 4.6 4.0 4.8 4.0 4.8 The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The assumptions shown above for the Rest of Group represent a weighted average of the assumptions used for the individual funds.
The UK defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants and under the projected unit method for closed schemes the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The assets and liabilities in respect of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group are as follows: At 31 March 2005 At 31 March 2004 At 31 March 2003 Rest of Rest of Rest of UK Group UK Group UK Group m m m m m m Equities 879 75 965 84 855 61 Bonds 539 52 353 56 246 56 Property 94 24 Other 103 65 90 52 53 36 Total fair value of scheme assets 1,615 216 1,408 192 1,154 153 Present value of funded scheme liabilities 1,775 172 1,744 213 1,630 207 Deficit surplus in funded defined benefit schemes 160 44 336 21 476 54 Unrecognisable surplus in funded defined benefit schemes 34 Deficit in unfunded schemes 20 15 20 26 18 30 Total deficit in defined benefit schemes 180 5 356 47 494 84 Deferred tax liability 3 Net liability 180 8 356 47 494 84 At 31 March 2005, the pension deficit calculated under FRS 17 for the funded defined benefit pension schemes was 160 million in respect of the principal UK scheme 2004 336 million, 2003 476 million and a surplus deficit of 10 million in respect of the Rest of the Group 2004 21 million, 2003 54 million.
The deficit in unfunded defined benefit schemes at 31 March 2005 was 35 million in respect of the Group 2004 46 million, 2003 48 million, including 20 million in respect of the UK 2004 20 million, 2003 18 million, and 15 million in respect of the Rest of the Group 2004 26 million, 2003 30 million.
A deferred tax liability of 3 million would be recognised at 31 March 2005 if the pension deficit of the Rest of the Group was reflected in the Financial statements.
Performance Notes to the financial statements If the above amounts were recognised in the Financial Statements, the Groups shareholders funds at 31 March 2005, 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2003 would be as follows: 2005 2004 2003 m m m Shareholders funds as presented 1,818 1,703 2,111 Less: SSAP 24 net assets 176 52 71 Shareholders funds excluding SSAP 24 net assets 1,642 1,651 2,040 FRS 17 retirement benefits net liability 188 403 578 Shareholders funds including FRS 17 retirement benefits net liability 1,454 1,248 1,462 Under the transitional requirements of FRS 17, the following disclosures are given to show the impact on the profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses if FRS 17 had been adopted in full.

This charge has been determined in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill as part of a Group-wide impairment review, which involved, amongst other factors, using discount rates of 8 to 40 per cent depending on the cost of capital of the respective businesses.
118 119 2005 Annual Report iii On 17 February 2005, the Group disposed of its Japanese operations, Cable & Wireless IDC, Inc. A gain of 42 million was recorded on disposal of this business within discontinued operations.
An exceptional credit of 66 million was recorded in respect of US domestic operations that were discontinued in the year ended 31 March 2004, principally comprising cash refunded to the Group as part of the Chapter 11 process.
In addition a net gain of 8 million was recorded in respect of the sale or termination of Group operations, being the net of previously accrued costs no longer required 42 million partially offset by additional charges in the year 34 million.
iv The gain on the disposal of fixed assets comprises 16 million relating to the disposal of a trade investment by Cable & Wireless, IDC Inc. prior to its disposal by the Group, 10 million relating to the release of costs accrued on the disposal of investments in previous years no longer required offset by a 3 million write-off of assets physically destroyed by Hurricane Ivan.
Year ended 31 March 2004 v Exceptional items included in other operating costs principally relate to the cost of restructuring Group businesses.
These costs include 93 million in respect of redundancy costs in continuing businesses United Kingdom 48 million, Panama 7 million, Caribbean 25 million, Japan 5 million, Other 8 million, 92 million in respect of property costs principally relating to the United Kingdom and 24 million of other costs of restructuring incurred by the UK and European businesses.
Other exceptional costs include 13 million of customer acquisition costs no longer recoverable in light of circumstances that have given rise to certain fixed asset impairments.
Exceptional costs of restructuring the discontinued US business prior to its disposal totalled 22 million principally relating to employee costs.
vi The Group carried out a review to determine whether there has been an impairment of its fixed assets and goodwill.
The carrying values of fixed assets of each of the Groups income generating units have been compared with their recoverable amounts, represented by their value in use to the Group.
The charge has been determined in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill which involved, amongst other factors, using discount rates of between 10.5 and 20 per cent depending on the cost of capital of the respective businesses.
The result of this assessment was a charge of 10 million in respect of goodwill in Jamaica and 526 million in respect of depreciation of fixed assets throughout the Group.
Tax credits of 64 million are available on the National Telecommunications companies depreciation impairment charges.
The depreciation impairment charge arose in the United Kingdom 119 million, Japan 126 million, Caribbean 197 million, Panama 65 million and Macau and the Rest of the World 19 million.
vii On 8 December 2003 the Groups US business filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection under the US Bankruptcy Code.
The effect of the filing for Chapter 11 together with the sale agreement with Gores was that the Groups ability to control Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. and Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. and their subsidiaries CW America was severely restricted.
Accordingly, the Group has deconsolidated Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. and Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. and their subsidiaries from 8 December 2003.
The gain on the exit of the US business of 191 million reflects the deconsolidation of third party net liabilities net of costs of exit.
In addition, 57 million of accrued costs relating to disposals in previous years, principally the disposal of the consumer operations of Cable & Wireless Communications plc on 30 May 2000, have been released.
A 2 million gain arose on the disposal of certain European businesses after taking account of the release of provisions relating to these businesses.
viii The gain on the disposal of fixed assets comprises 16 million relating to the disposal of certain properties in the United States as part of the restructuring of the US business prior to deconsolidation, and 12 million principally comprising disposal of properties in the United Kingdom and the Caribbean as part of restructuring.

Exceptional costs in the period of 248 million associated with this restructuring include 182 million in respect of property costs, 52 million in respect of redundancy costs and 14 million of other costs.
Other exceptional costs relate to integration costs of Digital Island and the business activities of Exodus of 31 million, redundancy costs of 38 million principally in the Caribbean, Panama and Macau, 44 million of provisions in respect of rentals on vacant properties and 81 million in respect of onerous network contracts and distressed carrier asset write offs.
Performance Notes to the financial statements x The Group carried out a review to determine whether there had been an impairment of its fixed assets and goodwill.
The carrying values of fixed assets and goodwill of each of the Groups income generating units was compared to their recoverable amounts, represented by their value in use to the Group.
The charge was determined in accordance with FRS 11 which involved, amongst other factors, using a growth rate of 2.5 per cent after five years based on a nominal increase in GDP for the countries in which the Group operates and a discount rate of 14 per cent.
The resulting charge was 12 million in respect of goodwill and 1,479 million in respect of fixed assets.
This charge was in addition to the charge of 2,713 million in respect of goodwill and 787 million in respect of fixed assets recognised at the half year.
Exceptional depreciation also includes the write off of redundant fixed assets of 58 million.
Tax credits of 48 million were available on 191 million of the impairment charge, which was disclosed in the 2002 Group Financial Statements.
xi The Group has exited its US retail voice business, as announced on 15 May 2002.
The exceptional costs associated with this amount to 288 million and include exit costs of 200 million, redundant fixed asset write downs of 57 million included in the exceptional depreciation charge and other write downs of 31 million.

Performance Notes to the financial statements 14 Earnings loss per share Basic earnings loss per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust and Treasury shares Note 24 which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per Ordinary Share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential Ordinary Shares: certain of the share options granted to employees and the shares issuable on conversion of the Groups convertible debt.
The table below sets out the reconciliation of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations: 2005 2004 2003 m m m Profit loss for the financial year attributable to shareholders 302 237 6,417 Effect of diluted securities Interest saved 8 Adjusted profit loss diluted EPS 310 237 6,417 Basic weighted average number of shares 2,322,458,697 2,327,738,940 2,329,814,506 Effect of diluted securities Share options 27,511,135 Convertible loan note 177,733,748 Diluted weighted average number of shares 2,527,703,580 2,327,738,940 2,329,814,506 Basic earnings loss per Ordinary Share 13.0p 10.2 p 275.4 p Diluted earnings loss per Ordinary Share 12.3p 10.2 p 275.4 p Basic and diluted loss per Ordinary Share are equal in periods where there is no impact of dilution on the loss for the financial year nor the weighted average number of shares.

See Note 25 for details of restrictions on short-term deposits.
The 80 million of Credit Linked Notes were issued by two AA-rated banks, and are referenced to the Companys 200 million bond, which matures in 2012.
These transactions have a similar economic effect to repurchasing the bonds for the period of the investment.
In return for the Company receiving interest on the Credit Linked Notes at rates in excess of LIBOR, the final redemption to be received by the Company would be less than face value if a credit event as defined in the terms of the note occurs in respect of Cable and Wireless plc.
Reflecting the terms of the underlying bond, credit events in the notes are as follows: bankruptcy: failure to make any payment due under any of its debt obligations, after expiration of any grace period and subject to a threshold of 25 million: and restructuring of any of its debt subject to a threshold of 25 million.
If a credit event should take place, the counterparties to the Credit Linked Notes are entitled to deliver to Cable and Wireless plc its own bonds or debt obligations with a face value equivalent to that of the Credit Linked Notes, or a cash amount equal to the market value thereof.

On 16 July 2003 257,714,000 4 per cent convertible unsecured bonds were issued at par.
Subject to Cable & Wireless right to make a cash alternative election, each bond entitles the holder to: i convert the conversion amount of such bond into fully paid Ordinary Shares of 25 pence each at the rate of 457.930 Ordinary Shares for each 1,000 held at an initial conversion price of 1.45 per Ordinary Share: and ii to have redeemed the cash settled amount of such bond in accordance with the terms and conditions representing 231.724 Ordinary Shares for each 1,000 held at the initial conversion price of 1.45 per Ordinary Share, at any time prior to 9 July 2010.
Full conversion of the bonds would result in an additional 177,733,748 shares being issued.
After 16 July 2007, if Cable & Wireless share price exceeds an amount calculated in accordance with the terms and conditions for a specified number of days, Cable & Wireless has the right to give not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days notice that it will redeem all unconverted bonds still outstanding on a given date at par plus accrued interest.

The deferred tax balance relates to capital allowances in excess of depreciation of 42 million Company 1 million and other timing differences of 1 million Company nil.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.
Due to the availability of losses and other reliefs, and the reinvestment of earnings, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
128 129 2005 Annual Report As at 31 March 2005, the Group had unrecognised deferred tax timing differences in the UK relating to surplus capital allowances of 1.8 billion 2004 1.8 billion and other timing differences of 0.2 billion 2004 0.1 billion.
These tax attributes will be available for offset against future UK taxable profits.
Additionally, at 31 March 2005, the Group had tax losses to carry forward of approximately 12.1 billion 2004 10.6 billion.
These principally arise in overseas holding companies where the opportunity to realise benefit from these losses is considered remote.
Included in debtors falling due after more than one year Note 19 are deferred tax debtors of 25 million of which 20 million 2004 28 million relates to surplus capital allowances and 5 million 2004 nil relates to other timing differences.
The movement in the deferred tax debtor includes 3 million debited to the profit and loss account.
ii Pensions The Group operates various unfunded pension plans.
Provision is made for the expected cost of meeting the associated liabilities.

130 131 2005 Annual Report The Cable & Wireless Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust The Cable & Wireless Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust the Trust is a discretionary trust, which has been funded by loans from the Company to acquire shares in Cable and Wireless plc.
The Trust holds 54,759,057 shares 2004 56,120,783 shares with a cost of 149 million 2004 152 million and a market value of 71 million 2004 73 million on 31 March 2005.
The Trust used funds provided by Cable and Wireless plc to meet the Groups obligations under the senior executive share option scheme.
Share options are granted to employees at the discretion of Cable and Wireless plc and shares are awarded to employees by the trust in accordance with the wishes of Cable and Wireless plc.
The costs of running the Trust are included in the profit and loss account as they accrue.
The Trustees of the plan may notionally allocate Ordinary Shares in the Company annually to Executive Directors or other senior executives and other key staff.
Shares are held in trust until such time as they may be transferred to employees in accordance with the terms of the Performance Share Plan, the Restricted Share Plan, the Deferred Short Term Incentive Plan, details of which are given in the Directors remuneration report, and the Share Option Plan, details of which are given below.
The shares will be provided from existing Ordinary Shares in issue acquired by the Trustees.
The expected cost of all these shares is charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the relevant scheme.
Surplus shares may be held to satisfy future awards.
The Trust has waived its rights to dividends.
At 31 March 2005, there were 3,214,187 shares under contingent awards in relation to the Performance Share Plan, 3,914,279 shares under restricted share awards in relation to the Restricted Share Plan, 1,110,739 shares under the Deferred Bonus Plan, 719,932 shares under the Deferred Short Term Incentive Plan, 35,000 shares under the Stock Appreciation Rights Plan, and 28,465,851 shares under options in relation to the Share Option Plan.
Cable & Wireless Savings Related Share Option Scheme and Cable & Wireless Global Savings Related Share Option Scheme Under the Cable & Wireless Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE scheme, UK employees can enter a savings contract with a bank to save regular monthly sums of between 5 and 250 for a period of either three or five years.
At the end of the savings contract, the participant receives interest from the bank on their savings.
The savings and the interest may then be used to exercise an option over Ordinary Shares of the Company, which are issued at a discount of 20 per cent to the market value of the Companys Ordinary Shares at the date of grant.
The Company has extended the SAYE scheme to its overseas employees by the Cable & Wireless Global Savings Related Share Option Scheme GSAYE scheme.
The GSAYE scheme is offered in various of the Groups territories excluding the United Kingdom and it operates along similar lines to the SAYE scheme with local variances to accommodate local legal and tax considerations.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption contained in UITF Abstract 17 Employee share schemes not to recognise a charge to the profit and loss account in respect of its Inland Revenue approved SAYE scheme.
Cable & Wireless Revenue Approved Share Option Scheme and Cable & Wireless Senior Employees Share Option Scheme Prior to July 2001, Cable & Wireless granted share options under the Cable & Wireless Senior Employees Share Option Scheme SESOS and the Cable & Wireless Revenue Approved Share Option Scheme RESOS.
Options awarded under these plans between June 1999 and July 2001 are subject to performance conditions based on Cable & WirelessTotal Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to the FTSE 100 Index, underpinned by real growth in EBITDA and turnover.
For full vesting, Cable & WirelessTSR must achieve at least upper quartile level against the FTSE 100 between the third and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.
Half vesting applies for TSR at the median level, with a sliding scale between median and upper quartile.
If the performance conditions are not met by the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the options lapse.
As at the date of this report, no such options have achieved their performance conditions.
Options granted under RESOS and SESOS before June 1999 became exercisable if growth in the Companys published earnings per share excluding exceptional items measured over any period of three consecutive financial years, commencing not earlier than the financial year in which the option was granted, exceeded by not less than 6 per cent the percentage growth of the Retail Price Index over the same three-year period.
All such options became exercisable in full.
No further grants will be made under the RESOS and SESOS plans.
Cable & Wireless Share Option Plan The Share Option Plan is the principal vehicle for long-term retention and incentivisation for the Executive Directors, other executives and key staff.
The level of any award is determined by the Remuneration Committee each year by reference to total remuneration within a market peer group, subject to an overriding annual limit of six times salary for the Chief Executive Officer and four times salary for other Executive Directors.
The vesting of share options awarded to the Executive Directors and to all employees outside the United States is subject to relative TSR performance conditions.
Full vesting occurs only if the TSR performance of the Company meets or exceeds the upper quartile between the third and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.
Where TSR performance meets the median, 50 per cent of the initial award vests.
A sliding scale operates between median and upper quartile, and nothing vests for TSR performance below the median.
If performance conditions have not been met by the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the options lapse.
With effect from May 2004 the re-testing of performance conditions for share options granted from that date have ceased.
If performance conditions for such options have not been met by the third anniversary of the date of grant the option lapses.
Performance conditions are applied in determining the level of awards to employees in the United States, but do not normally apply to the vesting of such awards.
In addition, 25 per cent of awards to employees in the United States vest on the first anniversary of the date of the grant with a further 25 per cent on each subsequent anniversary.
These terms reflect normal practice in the United States.
Performance Notes to the financial statements Cable & Wireless Share Purchase Plan The Company also offers its employees who are chargeable to income tax, under Section 15 Income Tax Earnings and Pensions Act 2003, the Cable & Wireless Share Purchase Plan the Plan which is a Revenue Approved Share Incentive Plan.
Under the Plan, employees can contribute up to a value of 1,500 or 10 per cent of salary each tax year, whichever is the lower to buy partnership shares in the Company.
Shares are held in a UK resident trust and can be withdrawn from the trust at any time, but there may be Pay As You Earn taxation and National Insurance contributions payable in such events if the shares have not been held in the trust for five years.
Dividends on the partnership shares are reinvested in additional Dividend Shares.
Stock Appreciation Rights Stock Appreciation Rights mirror the benefits of the three other elements of the Incentive Plan but are used in countries where it is more tax effective not to use actual shares or share options, or where the use of shares or share options is prohibited or made difficult by local legislation.

It will be reduced from time to time by the amount of any increase in the paid-up share capital and share premium account of the Company after 20 February 2004 resulting from the issue of new shares for cash or other new consideration or upon a capitalisation of distributable reserves.
The special reserve will not be treated as realised profits of the Company until any debt or claim against the Company outstanding as at 20 February 2004 has been repaid or remedied.
Exchange adjustments in the Group are net of exchange losses of 1 million 2004 nil, 2003 20 million on foreign currency borrowings.

132 133 2005 Annual Report The consideration paid to purchase shares held in the ESOP trust or for the repurchase of shares held in Treasury are deducted from the profit and loss reserve.
Prior year adjustments The adoption of UITF 38 has resulted in a change in the presentation of shares in the ESOP trust controlled by the Company as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds and has led to a decrease in shareholders funds.
Group Opening equity shareholders funds were originally 1,744 million before deducting a prior year adjustment of 41 million 2003 2,149 million before deductions of 38 million relating to a change in accounting policy for employee share awards.
A corresponding adjustment was made to other investments Own shares held.
Company Opening equity shareholders funds were originally 3,148 million before deducting a prior year adjustment of 41 million 2003 3,654 million before deductions of 38 million relating to a change in accounting policy for employee share awards.
The prior year adjustment in the Statement of total recognised gains and losses reflects the reversal of the previous impairment charge of 116 million and the change in basis on which charges in the profit and loss account are determined 3 million.
The profit and loss account for the year ended 31 March 2003 has been amended accordingly.
The adoption of UITF 17 did not have a material impact on the Group or Companys profit and loss accounts.
Accordingly, no adjustments have been made.
25 Financial instruments An outline of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by the Group in relation to financial instruments is set out under Liquidity and Capital Resources and Disclosures about Market Risk within the Operating and Financial Review.
For the purpose of the disclosures that follow in this note, short term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Groups operations have been excluded from financial assets and liabilities as permitted under FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures except for currency risk disclosures.

The fair value is based on year end quoted prices for listed investments and estimates of likely sales proceeds for other investments.
Cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits and short-term borrowings The carrying value approximates to fair value either because of the short maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate on investments is reset after periods not greater than six months.
Current asset investments and short-term deposits Included within short-term deposits are 42 million which is pledged as a cash collateral against bank loans and guarantees, and 30 million held in the Groups insurance subsidiary Pender against potential claim settlements, which, as a result, is not readily available for the general purposes of the Group.
Current asset investments The fair value is based on market value or estimates of likely sales proceeds.
Convertible bonds and other long term debt The fair value is based on quoted market prices or, where these are not available, on the quoted market prices of comparable debt issued by other companies.
Forward rate agreements, interest rate and cross currency swaps The fair value of forward rate agreements, interest rate and cross currency swaps is the estimated amount which the Group would expect to pay or receive were it to terminate the swaps at the balance sheet date.
This takes into consideration current interest rates, current exchange rates and the current creditworthiness of the counterparties.
The nominal value of swaps at 31 March 2005 was 121 million 2004 131 million.
Performance Notes to the financial statements Forward exchange contracts The value of these contracts is the estimated amount which the Group would expect to pay or receive on the termination of the contracts.

Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging excluding hedges that have been accounted for by adjusting the carrying value of a fixed asset recognised on the balance sheet, and on the underlying asset or liability, are as follows: 2005 2004 Net gains Net gains Gains Losses losses Gains Losses losses m m m m m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges At 1 April 3 4 1 Recognised during the year 3 4 1 At 31 March 26 Commitments and contingent liabilities Commitments Capital commitments at the end of the financial year, for which no provision has been made, are as follows: Group Company 2005 2004 2005 2004 m m m m Contracted 49 34 In addition to the capital commitments above the Group has a number of operating commitments arising in the ordinary course of the Groups business.
The most significant of these relate to network operating and maintenance costs.

Pender Insurance Limited Pender, the Groups Isle of Man insurance subsidiary, has written policies in favour of the Group and third parties.
Potentially significant insurance claims have been made against Pender under certain of these third party policies, which have also given rise to uncertainties and disputes with reinsurers.
Legal proceedings have been initiated against Pender and the Company in respect of certain insurance claims see Note 33.
The Group is subject to contingent liabilities in respect of litigation, third party insurance claims and obligations arising from past corporate transactions.
The ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to many uncertainties, including future events and the uncertainties inherent in litigation.
The Group has made provision in its financial statements for such matters.
Other matters The Company has given guarantees and indemnities in relation to a number of disposals of subsidiary undertakings in prior years as is considered standard practice in such agreements.
Generally, liability has been capped at no more than the value of the sales proceeds, although some uncapped indemnities have been given.

33 Legal proceedings Class action litigation against Cable and Wireless plc Between December 2002 and February 2003, ten shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia naming Cable and Wireless plc and several of its officers and directors as defendants.
In March 2003, the Court consolidated all the cases into one action, styled as In re Cable and Wireless plc Securities Litigation, Civil Action No.
In May 2003, the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint that alleged violations of certain sections of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder.
A central allegation was that the defendants made false and misleading statements about the Companys financial condition by failing to disclose on a timely basis the existence of a tax indemnity and a ratings trigger to place money in escrow until any liability which the Company may have had under the tax indemnity was finally determined.
The indemnity and ratings trigger appeared in an agreement reached in 1999 between the Company and Deutsche Telekom for the sale of the Companys interest in the mobile telephone company that operated under the name One2One.
In addition to the allegations relating to the tax indemnity, the consolidated complaint also alleged that the defendants made false and misleading statements by: 1 failing to disclose certain lease liability commitments and 2 improperly recognising revenue received from sales of capacity to other carriers.
The plaintiffs sought unspecified money damages in their complaints.
The Company and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the class action complaint, which were heard on 31 October 2003.
In March 2004 the Court issued orders granting the Companys and the individual defendants motions to dismiss the complaint but denying the defendants motion to dismiss the claims of foreign non-US purchasers for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
On 4 May 2004 and 5 June 2004, the Court issued memoranda opinions with regard to its previous orders.
On 15 June 2004, the Court entered judgement for the Company and the individual defendants consistent with its March 2004 orders and memoranda opinions.
On 16 April 2004, plaintiffs filed an appeal of the District Courts decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.
On 3 May 2004, defendants filed a notice of cross-appeal with respect to the District Courts order denying their motion to dismiss the claims of foreign non-US purchasers for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
While the case was pending on appeal, on 7 January 2005, the parties reached a preliminary agreement to settle the complaint on the basis of the defendants making a payment of US$7 million 3.7 million to the plaintiff class with the support of the Companys insurers in full and final settlement of the complaint.
On 1 March 2005, the parties filed a stipulation with the Court of Appeals requesting that the Court of Appeals remand the case to the District Court for the limited purpose of considering the parties settlement.
The Court of Appeals accordingly referred the case back to the District Court on 21 March 2005, for consideration of the settlement agreement.
The District Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement by order dated 13 May 2005.
The settlement is currently the subject of a formal notice period that will expire on 22 July 2005.
Assuming the conditions of the agreement are met, the final approval of the Court to the settlement is expected shortly after the end of the notice period.
Performance Notes to the financial statements Claim against the Minister of Finance and Economy, Panama On 16 December 2002, a complaint was filed by two Panamanian lawyers exercising a public action at the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice of Panama questioning the law governing and rules of Public Bid No.
06 96 won by INTEL, S. A. now Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A..
Complaints filed at the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice must be filed against the public officer who enacted the relevant regulation or act.
This complaint was filed against the Minister of Finance and Economy in Panama specifically alleging that the Operating Agreement executed between Cable and Wireless CALA Management Services Limited and INTEL, S. A. now Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. as part of the privatisation agreements was null and void ab initio, on the grounds that it had not been published in the Official Gazette in Panama.
The Operating Agreement enables Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. to use the technical and management know-how of Cable and Wireless CALA Management Services Limited to fulfil more effectively its obligations under the concession granted to it by the Government of Panama to install, operate and exploit telecommunication services in Panama.
Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. due to its close interest in the outcome of the complaint, requested recognition by the Court and permission to participate in the proceedings.
On 21 March 2003, the Court permitted the claim to proceed.
Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. filed an appeal against the admission of the claim to proceed, however the Court confirmed its decision to permit the claim to proceed on 17 March 2004.
As required by Panamanian law, the Administrations General Attorney has provided an opinion to the Court in defence of the law or regulation, which is the subject of the complaint.
The Administrations General Attorney has opined that the Operating Agreement complied with all the requirements established by the law and by the rules of Public Bid No.
06 96 and was countersigned by the General Comptroller acting with due authorisation.
On 1 April 2005, Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. tendered its response to the claim and submitted evidence for consideration by the Court.
Admission of evidence before the Court is currently pending.
The plaintiff has requested that the effect of the Operating Agreement be suspended temporarily an issue which the Court rejected on 10 March 2005.
The proceedings are ongoing, pending submission of evidence.
Panamanian counsel considers this claim to be without merit and none of Cable and Wireless plc, Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. or Cable and Wireless CALA Management Services Limited is party to the complaint.
If the complaint were to be successful, the concession under which Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. operates would not be affected.
However the Operating Agreement could be declared null and void and then the complainants could file a complaint against Cable and Wireless CALA Management Services Limited requiring the return of all management fees collected under the agreement since its execution on 20 May 1997.
This would amount to approximately 60 million.
In the event that this complaint should be successful, Cable & Wireless and its subsidiaries intend to vigorously pursue any legal recourse available to them.
Telecarrier Inc. vs. Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A.
On 5 May 2004, Telecarrier Inc. lodged a claim in the Sixth Circuit Civil Court of Panama alleging non-compliance by Cable & Wireless Panama S. A.

142 143 2005 Annual Report Arbitration between PT Cable, Inc. Cable and Wireless plc, Cable & Wireless IDC, Inc. and others PT Cable, Inc. PT Cable the US end owner of NPC Cable System spanning from the United States to Japan, initiated an ICC arbitration proceeding against Cable and Wireless plc, Japan Telecom IDC, Inc. IDC and other users of capacity on that system for unpaid operations and maintenance fees with respect to the US end.
Cable & Wireless and all 14 other US end owners counter-claimed against PT Cable for overcharging operation and maintenance fees.
PT Cable then cross-claimed against Cable & Wireless and IDC in their capacity as maintenance authorities and alleged that Cable & Wireless and IDC should be liable to contribute to any damages the Arbitrator may award against PT Cable.
Potential exposure of PT Cable is between US$13 million 6.9 million and US$33 million 17.6 million.
PT Cables counter-claim against Cable & Wireless and IDC is for an unquantified proportion of that amount.
PT Cable failed to pay its arbitration filing fees and earlier this year was placed into Chapter 7 liquidation proceedings.
The arbitration is therefore currently stayed.
On 28 January 2005, AT&T Corp and Alascom, Inc.
Claimants filed a Request for Arbitration before the ICC against Cable and Wireless plc and IDC Respondents relating to the Respondents alleged duties as Founding Signatories and Maintenance Authorities under the Construction & Maintenance Agreement for the NPC.
The Claimants allege breach of contract, fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty and similar claims against the Respondents in connection with alleged overcharging of operations and maintenance fees by PT Cable.
The complaint is for unquantified damages.
The Companys US Counsel has advised that, in their opinion, all of the Claimants claims are weak.
The Company has filed its Answer to the Request for Arbitration and arbitrators are currently being selected.
As far as quantum of damages is concerned, AT&Ts claim is duplicative of the counter-claim by PT Cable in the first arbitration above save that AT&T has claimed punitive damages.
Therefore Cable & Wireless believes its exposure remains within the parameters of the estimate set out above.
Cable & Wireless will continue to vigorously defend its position in each of the arbitration proceedings brought against it.
Pender Insurance Limited Australia-Japan Cable Limited AJC, a policyholder of Pender Insurance Limited Pender has brought proceedings in London against Pender and Cable & Wireless.
AJC claims that it is entitled to insurance cover for loss of revenue following damage caused to an undersea cable by a cargo vessel.
It also claims that, if it does not have such cover, Pender or Cable & Wireless is liable for its losses because of representations made to AJC that it was entitled to such insurance cover.
The claim is for US$92 million 49 million.
Pender and Cable & Wireless have been advised by legal counsel that the claim is unmeritorious and accordingly are defending it vigorously.
Certain of Penders re-insurers of the AJC risk have instituted proceedings seeking a declaration that they are entitled to avoid their obligations.
Pender is also vigorously defending these proceedings.
On 3 June 2005, QBE International Insurance Limited QBE issued Pender with a request for arbitration on account of insurance premium payments of 36 million allegedly outstanding.
Pender has received advice that this claim is substantially without merit and intends to defend it vigorously.
Pender has also been advised that, in the unlikely event of QBE recovering any funds as a result of this claim, it would be contractually obliged to pass such funds less a small fee under retrocession arrangements to Messenger Insurance PCC Limited Messenger, one of the defendants to the proceedings brought by Pender and Cable and Wireless plc described on page 91.
Pender has been advised that, given the strength of its misfeasance claims against Messenger, it would have a strong chance of recovering any such sums paid by QBE to Messenger arising out of the subject matter of the arbitration request.
Other litigation From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to legal or regulatory claims, proceedings, investigations or reviews.
Other than the above, there are no pending claims, proceedings, investigations or reviews against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, which the Company believes will, if determined adversely to the Group, have a material adverse effect on the Groups liquidity or operations.

The list therefore only includes those companies whose results or financial position, in the opinion of the Directors, principally affects the figures shown in the Groups Financial Statements.
Full details of all subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures, associates and trade investments will be attached to the Companys Annual Return, to be filed with the Registrar of Companies in England and Wales.
a The Group regards this company as a subsidiary because it controls the majority of the Board of Directors through a shareholders agreement.
b This company had a financial year end of 31 December 2004 due to the requirements of the shareholders agreement.
c The Group regards this company as a subsidiary undertaking because it exercises dominant influence.
d This company is audited by a firm other than KPMG International member firms.
e The Group holds an economic interest of 55 per cent in Monaco Telecom S. A. M. 1 On 18 June 2004 Cable & Wireless acquired 55 per cent of Monaco Telecom S. A. M. Monaco Telecom, a Monaco-based telecommunication service provider, from Vivendi Universal.
Simultaneously with the acquisition, Cable & Wireless transferred legal ownership of six per cent of the shares of Monaco Telecom to Compagnie Monegasque fide Banque S. A. M. CMB, an unrelated third party.
Cable & Wireless contractually retained voting and economic rights in the shares as part of the arrangement.
In addition, the six per cent interest is subject to certain put and call options that, together with the retained voting and economic rights, provide full management control of Monaco Telecom to Cable & Wireless.
Cable & Wireless has also entered into a shareholders agreement with the Principality of Monaco which contains, among other provisions, a prohibition on either Cable & Wireless or the Principality subject to certain limited exceptions selling their shares in Monaco Telecom for five years, mutual pre-emption rights on transfer of shares and certain other limited rights in favour of the Principality.
The Principality has a put option entitling it to put its 45 per cent shareholding in Monaco Telecom to Cable & Wireless at certain times after 1 January 2008.
The exercise price under the put option is fair market value, taking into account the nature of the minority stake in Monaco Telecom.
