SRC is valued by assuming it is distributed from the LTF using a large number of real world economic scenarios derived over a 20 year period with allowance for tax payable on from assumptions consistent with the deterministic EEV assumptions distribution.
For this purpose, distribution of the SRC is restricted and allowing for appropriate management actions where such that there is always sufficient SRC and subordinated debt left applicable.

For new business, the cost of capital is taken as the difference in the value of that the future lifetime of the in-force with-profits policies.
However, capital assuming it was available for release immediately and the under stochastic modelling there may be some extreme economic present value of the future releases of that capital.
