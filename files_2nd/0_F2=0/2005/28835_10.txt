d Uncertainties and contingencies The uncertainty arising under insurance contracts may be characterised under a number of specific headings, such as: uncertainty as to whether an event has occurred which would give rise to a policyholder suffering an insured loss: uncertainty as to the extent of policy coverage and limits applicable: uncertainty as to the amount of insured loss suffered by a policyholder as a result of the event occurring: and uncertainty over the timing of a settlement to a policyholder for a loss suffered.
The degree of uncertainty will vary by policy class according to the characteristics of the insured risks and the cost of a claim will be determined by the actual loss suffered by the policyholder.
There may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is actually reported to the Group.
Following the identification and notification of an insured loss, there may still be uncertainty as to the magnitude and timing of the settlement of the claim.
There are many factors that will determine the level of uncertainty such as inflation, inconsistent judicial interpretations and court judgements that broaden policy coverage beyond the intent of the original insurance, legislative changes and claims handling procedures.
The establishment of insurance liabilities is an inherently uncertain process and, as a consequence of this uncertainty, the eventual cost of settlement of outstanding claims and unexpired risks can vary substantially from the initial estimates, particularly for long tail lines of business.
The Group seeks to provide appropriate levels of claims provision and provision for unexpired risks taking the known facts and experience into account.
The Group has exposures to risks in each class of business within each operating segment that may develop and that could have a material impact upon the Groups financial position in the period in which the development occurs.
The geographical and insurance risk diversity within the Groups portfolio of issued insurance policies make it not possible to predict whether material development will occur and, if it does occur, the location and the timing of such an occurrence.
The estimation of insurance liabilities involves the use of judgements and assumptions that are specific to the insurance risks within each territory and the particular type of insurance risk covered.
The diversity of the insurance risks results in it not being possible to identify individual judgements and assumptions that are more likely than others to have a material impact on the future development of the insurance liabilities.
The sections below identify a number of specific risks relating to asbestos and environmental claims and to insurance risks remaining within the Groups discontinuing US operations.
There may be other classes of risk that are not specifically identified below, which could develop in the future and that could have a material impact on the Groups financial position during the period in which the development occurs.
The Group evaluates the concentration of exposures to individual and cumulative insurance risk and establishes its reinsurance policy to reduce such exposure to levels acceptable to the Group.
124 Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2005 Asbestos and environmental claims The estimation of the provisions for the ultimate cost of claims for asbestos and environmental pollution is subject to a range of uncertainties that is generally greater than those encountered for other classes of insurance business.
As a result it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as with other types of claims, particularly in periods when theories of law are in flux.
Consequently, traditional techniques for estimating claims provisions cannot wholly be relied upon and the Group employs specialised techniques to determine provisions using the extensive knowledge of both internal asbestos and environmental pollution experts and external legal and professional advisors.
Factors contributing to this higher degree of uncertainty include: plaintiffs expanding theories of liability, compounded by inconsistent court decisions and judicial interpretations: a few large claims, accompanied by a very large number of small claims or claims made with no subsequent payment, often driven by intensive advertising by lawyers seeking claimants: the tendency for speculative, inflated and or unsupported claims to be made to insurers, with the aim of securing a settlement on advantageous terms: the long delay in reporting claims and exposures, since the onset of illness and disability arising from exposure to harmful conditions may only become apparent many years later for example, cases of mesothelioma can have a latent period of up to 40 years : inadequate development patterns: difficult issues of allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and insurers: complex technical issues that may give rise to delays in notification arising from unresolved legal issues on policy coverage and the identity of the insureds: the tendency for social trends and factors to influence jury verdicts: and developments pertaining to the Groups ability to recover reinsurance for claims of this nature.
The position in the US is particularly problematic, as plaintiffs have expanded their focus to defendants beyond the traditional asbestos manufacturers and distributors.
This has arisen as a consequence of the increase in the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection because of asbestos related litigation and the exhaustion of their policy limits.
Plaintiffs, supported by lawyers remunerated on a contingent fee basis, are now seeking to draw in a wide cross section of defendants who previously only had peripheral or secondary involvement in asbestos litigation.
This may include companies which have distributed or incorporated asbestos containing parts in their products or operated premises where asbestos was present.
There are also increasing signs of attempts to reopen and reclassify into other insurance coverages previously settled claims, and the filing of claims under the non aggregate premises or operations section of general liability policies.
There are also indications that plaintiffs may seek damages by asserting that insurers had a duty to protect the public from the dangers of asbestos.
Federal legislation that would address asbestos related problems, Senate Bill 852, an amended version of Senate Bill 2290 Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution or FAIR Act, was introduced in April 2005 by Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Arlen Specter.
The amended bill includes establishing a privately financed trust fund to provide payments to individuals with asbestos related illnesses and removal of asbestos claims from the tort litigation system for the duration of the fund.
The proposed bill would remove pending and future cases from the judicial system and place these cases and claims into a no fault trust fund to be administered by the US Department of Labour.
It would establish medical criteria to ensure that only people who showed signs of asbestos related illnesses would be entitled to payments from the trust.
However, there are concerns that the bill contains several loopholes which would allow cases to revert to the tort system at various points of the trust funds life.
This would undermine the certainty and finality that insurers and manufacturers defendants seek.
Given the recent events in the Senate where floor debate ended with Senate Bill 852 sent back to Committee and the heavy opposition that remains for various parties, any prospects of passage of SB 852 in its current form are speculative at best.
It is possible that the focus could shift to a medical criteria or another version of asbestos reform.
125 Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2005 Against this background, and in common with the industry generally, the Group in the US receives notifications and approaches from, and on behalf of, insureds who previously had peripheral or secondary involvement in asbestos litigation indicating that they may be seeking coverage under Group policies.
Given the uncertainties outlined above as to the potential of loss suffered, the availability of coverage and the often long delay in reporting these issues it is difficult to predict the outcome of these notifications and approaches.
The greatest difficulty is with estimating whether the Group has any liability as many of these are discharged at no cost to the Group or have been settled below the quantum sought, although there can be no certainty that this will always be the case.
It is clear that there is unlikely to be any firm direction in case law or legislation which would allow for these issues to be resolved satisfactorily in the near term and no likelihood of the plaintiffs bar in the US easing its aggressive stance on litigation.
Management, therefore, expects that these notifications and approaches will continue to be received for some time to come.
One such approach received during 2004 from General Motors Corporation is now the subject of ongoing litigation.
Representations and warranties In the course of disposal of businesses the Group provides representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with various transactions and may also provide indemnifications that protect the counterparties to the contracts in the event that certain liabilities arise covering such matters as tax, property, environmental issues, etc.
While such representations, warranties and indemnities are essential components of many contractual relationships, they do not represent the underlying purpose for the transaction.
These clauses are customary in such contracts and may from time to time lead to us receiving claims from counterparties.
Financial enhancement products In the UK and US the Group has exposures to financial enhancement products, which provide surety to banks, lending institutions and credit facilities that insure principal and interest repayment on debt securities.
The Group no longer writes such business, however, the nature of such contracts is normally that the Group is on risk for more than one year and therefore liabilities remain for an extended period.
Further information on financial enhancement products in the US is discussed below.
US financial enhancement products Within the financial enhancement portfolio of Financial Structures Limited, a subsidiary of the US Group, are a variety of financial enhancement product exposures including collateralised debt obligations CDO, credit enhancement and residual value insurance contracts.
These products are no longer written.
During the first quarter 2005 the Group terminated a number of these contracts for a net pre tax gain of $7m.
The fair value of the remaining two contracts was a liability of $157m at 31 December 2005, unchanged since 31 December 2004.
During February 2006 one of the remaining two contracts was terminated for a net pre tax gain of $4m.
The fair value of the remaining contract at 31 December 2005 was a liability of $75m.
Litigation, mediation and arbitration The Group, in common with the insurance industry in general, is subject to litigation, mediation and arbitration, and regulatory and other sectoral inquiries in the normal course of its business.
The directors do not believe that any current mediation, arbitration, regulatory or sectoral inquiries and pending or threatened litigation or dispute, as outlined elsewhere in this note, will have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position, although there can be no assurance that losses resulting from any pending mediation, arbitration, regulatory inquiries and threatened litigation or dispute will not materially affect the Groups financial position or cash flows for any period.
126 Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2005 Reinsurance The Group is exposed to disputes on, and defects in, contracts with its reinsurers and the possibility of default by its reinsurers.
The Group is also exposed to the credit risk assumed in fronting arrangements.
In selecting the reinsurers with whom we do business our strategy is to seek reinsurers with the best combination of credit rating, price and capacity.
We publish internally a list of authorised reinsurers who pass our selection process and which our operations may use for new transactions.
The Group monitors the financial strength of its reinsurers, including those to whom risks are no longer ceded.
Allowance is made in the financial position for non recoverability due to reinsurer default by requiring operations to provide, in line with Group standards, having regard to companies on the Groups Watch List.
The Watch List is the list of companies whom the Directors believe will not be able to pay amounts due to the Group in full.
Rating agencies The ability of the Group to write certain types of insurance business is dependent on the maintenance of the appropriate credit ratings from the rating agencies.
The Group has the objective of maintaining single A ratings.
At the present time the ratings are Afrom S&P and Afrom AM Best.
Any worsening in the ratings would have an adverse impact on the ability of the Group to write certain types of general insurance business.
Regulatory environment The regulatory environment is subject to significant change in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
We continue to monitor the developments and react accordingly.
The Directors are confident that the Group will continue to meet all future regulatory capital requirements.
In addition the Group is continuing to monitor and respond to consultation on the latest Solvency II proposals, which are intended in the medium term, to achieve greater harmonisation of approach across European member states to assessing capital resources and requirements.
World Trade Centre The estimated cost of the insurance losses associated with the terrorist action of 11 September 2001 is a gross loss in excess of 1bn, reduced to 280m net of reinsurance.
This was an unprecedented event, which still has unresolved issues in respect of both the gross loss and consequent extent of the reinsurance recoveries.
The loss estimate has been prepared on the basis of the information currently available as to the magnitude of the claims, including business interruption losses.
The final cost may be different from the current estimate due to the uncertainty associated with ongoing appeals and the valuation and allocation process which is currently underway in respect of the Twin Towers complex.
Appraisal hearings are scheduled to continue until December 2006.
Nevertheless, the Directors believe their estimate of the gross and net loss is appropriate based on the information available to them and that there will be no material adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
Student Finance Corporation In early 2002, issues arose in connection with a series of credit risk insurance policies covering loans made to students in various post secondary trade schools, primarily truck driving schools.
The original loan portfolio had a face value of approximately $501m.
In mid July 2002, Royal Indemnity Company, a US subsidiary, filed lawsuits in Texas state court, seeking among other things rescission of these policies in response to a systematic pattern of alleged fraud, misrepresentation and cover up by various parties, which among other things concealed the default rate of the loans.
Since Royal Indemnitys lawsuits seek rescission of these policies, all the Groups financial accounting entries associated with the transactions have been reversed.
The ultimate outcome of the suits is uncertain.
The foregoing rescission actions gave rise to other related lawsuits filed in Delaware by MBIA Insurance Corporation MBIA and various banks, seeking to enforce the Royal Indemnity credit risk 127 Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc and UK Subsidiaries Returns under the Accounts and Statements Rules Notes to the Return Financial year ended 31 December 2005 insurance policies.
Plaintiffs in the Delaware actions included Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, NA Wells Fargo, in its capacity as trustee of a number of securitisations that were collateralised by student loans, and MBIA which insured the obligations issued through these securitisations.
These actions were heard in US District Court, District of Delaware.
Plaintiffs in the Delaware actions moved for summary judgement.
The Court granted summary judgement to MBIA and Wells Fargo on 30 September 2003.
Calculated through 31 December 2005, the total amount awarded by the foregoing summary judgements was approximately $386m.
Royal Indemnity appealed to each of these judgements.
On 4 October 2005 the Court of Appeal upheld the District Courts ruling that Royal Indemnity waived its right to rescind its policy obligations based on Student Finance Corporations fraud and that the policies remain in force.
The Court, however, concluded that Royal Indemnity has raised a triable issue as to whether all of the losses claimed by the beneficiaries were covered under those policies.
As a result, the Court overturned the summary judgement and returned the case to the District Court to determine coverage and whether the policies cover all of the losses claimed.
Royal Indemnity has filed a petition for a rehearing of its appeal.
In April 2005 and October 2005, respectively, PNC Bank and Wilmington Trust, plaintiffs in the Delaware actions, agreed to discontinue their parts of the legal action following agreed settlements.
The ultimate outcome of these lawsuits is necessarily uncertain.
In the event Royal Indemnitys lawsuits do not result in complete rescission of all applicable policies, any loss on the loan portfolio will be reduced to the extent of reinsurance available to Royal Indemnity, recoveries from the original borrowers on the defaulted loans, and reserves, if any.
Any losses may be further offset by recoveries from other third parties.
To that end, Royal Indemnity is actively pursuing recovery actions against certain trucking school entities and professional advisers.
However, there can be no assurance that the outcome of these lawsuits, the availability of reinsurance recoveries, the extent and amount of recoveries from the borrower under the respective loan programmes and or reserves, if any, among other factors, will be resolved in favour of Royal Indemnity.
Based on current knowledge of the circumstances, legal advice received and the range of other actions available to the Group to manage any insurance exposure, the directors believe that the resolution of the legal proceedings in respect of these credit risk insurance policies will not have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
US restructuring Our US restructuring plans are complex and are subject to particular risks.
Although we have reduced the number of lead regulatory states, our US subsidiaries are subject to government regulation in their states of domicile and also in each of the jurisdictions in which they are licensed or authorised to do business.
In the US, the conduct of insurance business is regulated at the state level and not by the federal government and our subsidiaries are subject to state supervision of their regulatory capital and surplus positions.
At 31 December 2005 our consolidated US regulatory capital and surplus capital position was 2.2 times the NAIC ratio.
