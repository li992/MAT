Provisions for liabilities and charges Group Group 30 June 2005 30 June 2004 000 000 At 1 July 2004 6,116 5,223 Credit charge for the year 4,804 893 At 30 June 2005 1,312 6,116 The provision which is entirely for deferred tax, comprises: Group Group 30 June 2005 30 June 2004 000 000 Accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences 10,216 18,303 Losses available to offset 8,904 12,187 1,312 6,116 On the basis that capital allowances claimed to date will not be retained by the Group, the potential amount of further taxation, for which no provision has been made and which could arise if the properties held as investments were sold at the values at which they appear in the balance sheet, has been estimated at 51.7 million.
Tax losses of approximately 90.1 million have not been recognised in the balance sheet, of which approximately 60.4 million have been used to reduce the contingent tax.
If account is taken of the likelihood that capital allowances claimed to date will be retained by the Group, then the potential tax liability which could arise if the properties were sold at the values at which they appear in the balance sheet has been estimated to be 43.3 million.
This is calculated on the same basis as above except that additional tax losses of 28.1 million would be available to reduce the contingent tax.
