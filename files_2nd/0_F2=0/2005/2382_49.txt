The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for unlisted fixed asset investments approximates their fair value.
Non-current assets Loans The loans generally bear interest at floating rates, so the fair value of loans is estimated not to be materially different from its carrying value.
Non-current assets Other receivables The fair value of other receivables is estimated not to be materially different from its carrying value.
Current assets Loans The loans generally bear interest at floating rates, so the fair value of loans is estimated not to be materially different from its carrying value.
Current assets Cash and cash equivalents As a result of their short maturities, the carrying value of cash equivalents approximates their fair value.
Finance debt The carrying amount of the groups short-term borrowings, which mainly comprise commercial paper, bank loans and overdrafts, approximates their fair value.
The fair value of the groups long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations is estimated using quoted prices or, where these are not available, discounted cash flow analyses, based on the groups current incremental borrowing rates for similar types and maturities of borrowing.
Swaps and forward contracts used to hedge finance debt is offset against the carrying value of the debt.
Non-current liabilities Other payables Deferred consideration for the acquisition of our interest in TNK-BP is discounted to the present value of the future payments.
The carrying value thus approximates the fair value.
The remaining liabilities are predominantly interest-free.
In view of their short maturities, the reported carrying amount is estimated to approximate the fair value.
Non-current liabilities Provisions Where the liability will not be settled for a number of years, the amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future expenditure.
The carrying amount of provisions thus approximates the fair value.
Current liabilities Provisions Where the liability will not be settled for a number of years, the amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future expenditure.
Derivative financial instruments including cash-settled commodity contracts The fair values of the groups interest rate and foreign exchange contracts are based on pricing models that take into account relevant market data.
The fair value of the groups oil, natural gas and power price contracts future contracts, swap agreements, options and forward contracts is based on market prices.
