This comprises goodwill impairment of 13.9 million and severance costs.
Savings of approximately 5 million are targeted from this restructuring during 2006.
In 2004 following the sale of the packaged gas business in the US, costs of 14.8 million were incurred to restructure the footprint of the remaining business in the US.
This covered the severance costs and other costs of restructuring those functions which are shared by BOCs businesses in the US.
Restructuring costs in 2004 also included a charge of 2.6 million 2003: 8.3 million relating to the integration of BOCs gases business and part of the Air Liquide business in Japan to form Japan Air Gases.
The restructuring costs in 2003 related to various programmes including programmes under the business initiative announced in August 2001.
The major programmes covered investments in information management systems, the restructuring of BOC Edwards manufacturing capacity and restructuring to deliver operational efficiencies in Process Gas Solutions and Industrial and Special Products.
These programmes were completed in 2004.
Cash flow from operating activities includes an outflow of 16.9 million 2004: 11.9 million, 2003: 28.3 million in respect of the various restructuring programmes.

The gain on disposal was 84.9 million.
The sale of the packaged gas business in the US was completed on 30 July 2004.
The loss on disposal of 79.5 million in 2004 included the write-off of the assets associated with the business, severance and other disposal costs.
It also included a goodwill write-off of 19.9 million, of which 15.3 million had been written off to reserves in the years up to, and including, 1998 in accordance with prevailing UK GAAP at that time.
Part of the consideration was payable subject to certain conditions and accordingly was not recognised in 2004.
This remaining consideration was received in November 2005 and has been recognised in 2005 as an exceptional item.
iv Profit on disposal of fixed assets The sale of an investment in the US in 2005 resulted in a profit of 10.5 million, which has been accounted for as an exceptional item.

Audit related services include advice associated with the implementation of Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 and International Financial Reporting Standards.
These services are treated as non-audit services in 2005.
The expatriate administration contract was signed in June 2001 for a five year period following a competitive tender process.
The audit fees for the Afrox hospitals business are 0.4 million for 2005.
These fees are not included in the above figures for 2005 following the disposal by BOCs South African subsidiary of its majority shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited in March 2005.
BOC operates a number of policies designed to ensure auditor independence and objectivity.
The audit committee is responsible for overseeing implementation of these policies including the review of all expenditure related to non-audit services.
The audit committee, by delegation to the chairman of the audit committee, approves in advance any non-audit services and has approved a policy that prevents the use of the auditor for any services that could threaten the independence or objectivity of the audit.

Tax continued d Factors that may affect future tax charges The total charge in future periods will be affected by any changes to the corporation tax rates in force in the countries in which the Group operates.
The current tax charge will also be affected by changes in the excess of tax depreciation over book depreciation and the use of tax credits.
e Unused tax credits On a consolidated basis, the Group has net operating loss carryforwards of 1.3 million.
If not offset against taxable income, these losses will expire as follows: Net operating loss Year million 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter, or no expiry date 1.3 For US Federal tax purposes, the Group has investment tax credits and general business tax credits to carry forward of approximately 7.8 million, which are available to reduce income taxes otherwise payable.
These do not expire until 2006 or thereafter.
In addition, the Group has alternative minimum tax credits for US Federal income tax purposes of approximately 27.3 million which can be carried forward to reduce regular tax liabilities of future years.
There is no expiration date on these credits.
Investment tax credits are accounted for by the flow-through method whereby they reduce income taxes currently payable and the provision for income taxes in the period in which the assets giving rise to such credits are placed in service.
Deferred tax assets, subject to the need for a valuation allowance, are recognised to the extent that the investment tax credits are not currently utilised.
Directors Directors remuneration and interests are given in the report on remuneration on pages 72 to 83.

Options and incentive schemes a Policy Executive options that are granted at the market price of the companys shares at the time of the grant do not attract a compensation expense under UK GAAP.
For those executive options, including the Long-Term Incentive Plan, that are granted at a discount to the market price of the companys shares at the time of the grant, the compensation expense is charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the option.
The Group takes advantage of the exemption granted under UITF17 revised 2003, Employee Share Schemes, whereby no compensation expense need be recorded for employee schemes that are granted at a discount.
b Summary of movements BOC operates share option schemes for both executives and employees.
The features of these are given in the report on remuneration on pages 73 to 75 and in the employees report on page 25.
The long-term incentive plan was granted at an option price of nil.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Notes to the financial statements 103 8.
Pensions and other retirement benefits a UK GAAP Group The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The larger schemes are self-administered and the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups finances.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
Contributions to funded defined benefit schemes are based on advice from independent actuaries using actuarial methods, the objective of which is to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
For the two largest schemes, in the UK and US, the dates of the latest actuarial reviews are 31 March 2002 and 1 January 2004 respectively.
In South Africa, under the Pension Funds Second Amendment Act 2001, surpluses in pension funds have to be used in a manner specified in Regulations to the Act to improve current and former members benefits before the employer can obtain any benefit from the surpluses.
Consequently, it is considered unlikely that the company will obtain any benefit from the surpluses in the South African schemes.
Therefore, in accordance with FRS17, the surpluses at 30 September 2005 have been written off in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
In Europe, company contributions to the main scheme in respect of current service are currently payable at a rate of 13.8 per cent of payroll.
In the year ended 30 September 2005 the company made additional contributions of 36 million to this scheme in order to reduce the funding valuation deficit.
The level of additional contributions for the year to 30 September 2006 is expected to be up to 20 per cent higher than in 2005.
In the Americas, company contributions to the main pension plan remain suspended as the plan continues to be in surplus.
In Africa, company contributions were payable at rates ranging from 11 per cent to 21 per cent of payroll and are expected to remain at that level for the year to 30 September 2006.
In Asia Pacific, company contributions to the main scheme were payable at rates ranging from 9 per cent to 20 per cent of payroll and are expected to remain at that level for the year to 30 September 2006.
Some of the defined benefit schemes, including the UK scheme, are closed to new members.
It is therefore expected that under the projected unit method prescribed by FRS17 the contribution rate in respect of current service will increase as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
The most recent actuarial funding valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries, in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 30 September 2005 for the purposes of FRS17.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 30 September 2005.

In accordance with the standard, the company treats contributions to defined benefit schemes as if they were contributions to a defined contribution plan.
This is because the underlying assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes cover a number of the Groups UK undertakings and cannot readily be split between each undertaking on a consistent and reliable basis.
The pension cost recognised in the companys accounts is the total of company contributions payable to Group UK pension schemes in the year.
The assets of all Group UK pension schemes are held independently of the Groups finances.
The largest schemes are self-administered.
c US GAAP For the purposes of US GAAP, the pension costs of the largest schemes have been reclassified in the following tables in accordance with the requirement of SFAS132.
The changes in projected benefit obligation, plan assets and details of the funded status of these retirement plans, together with the changes in the accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligations of the Groups US business, are given below.
The measurement date for UK and US pension plans is 30 June and the measurement date for the Australian and South African plans is 30 September.
The difference between the UK and US GAAP information disclosed in note 8a and c is included in note 30.
Investment strategy for the schemes is generally set by their respective trustee or fiduciary, after taking advice from their investment advisers, and in consultation with the company.
The strategy reflects the funding position of the schemes, and a careful assessment of the risks inherent over the long term in various asset classes.
The assets of the schemes are diversified by asset class, by investment manager and by geography, in order to reduce risk.
At 30 June 2005 the measurement date for SFAS132 reporting, the target asset allocation and actual asset allocation of the main UK scheme was: 2005 2004 Target Actual Actual Equity securities 68% 69% 72% Debt securities 18% 17% 19% Real estate 14% 13% 8% Cash 0% 1% 1% In the US, the fiduciary invests in short-term bonds to broadly cash match the liabilities that are expected to fall due within three years.
The balance of the plans assets is currently invested in equities.
Following this policy, the actual asset allocations of the plan at 30 June 2005 were as follows: 2005 2004 Equity securities 84.9% 77.5% Debt securities 15.1% 22.5% The company establishes the long-term expected rate of return on the schemes assets by developing a long-term rate of return assumption for each asset class, taking into account such factors as the market yield on bond investments of appropriate duration, and the expected risk premium for other asset classes, based on long-term historical trends.
A single, long-term return assumption is then calculated as a weighted average return, based on the expected returns for each asset class.

The rates for valuing post age 65 medical benefits are assumed to reduce gradually to 4.5 per cent in 2013 2004: 4.5 per cent in 2011.
The rates for valuing drug benefits post age 65 are assumed to reduce gradually to 0.55 per cent in 2013 2004: 0.65 per cent in 2011.
For valuing pre age 65 medical and drug benefits, a blended health care trend rate of 10.0 per cent was used for 30 September 2005 2004: 9.0 per cent.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potential dilutive shares.
The company has only one category of potential dilutive shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys shares during the year and where any performance conditions have been met at the balance sheet date.

Financial instruments a Interest rate, currency and counterparty exposure The Groups approach to managing currency and interest rate risk and its use of swaps in that process is described on page 56 in the financial review under the heading management of financial risks.
Interest rate swaps At 30 September 2005, the Group had entered into five interest rate swap agreements 2004: five with its main relationship banks with notional principal amounts of 286.4 million 2004: 285.3 million.
The swaps underlying currencies are sterling, US dollars and Japanese yen.
The following table shows the maturity profile and weighted average interest rates payable and receivable on interest rate swaps at 30 September: 2005 2004 Maturity profile million million Beyond five years Four to five years 200.0 Three to four years 200.0 85.3 Two to three years 86.4 One to two years Within one year 286.4 285.3 % % Weighted average receivable swap rate 4.1 3.8 Weighted average payable swap rate 4.8 4.5 The weighted average receivable payable swap interest rate is calculated by applying the notional swap interest received or paid, using rates applicable at the financial year end, to the notional principal of outstanding swaps at the financial year end.
During 2004, the Group also entered into four interest rate swap agreements that are due to commence in 2006 and 2007 for a period of five years.
The notional principal amounts of these swaps are 106.4 million and their underlying currencies are US dollars and Japanese yen.

For those bearing either no interest or a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
For those bearing a fixed rate of interest an assessment of the interest rate at which the Group could make the same loan under current market conditions has been made.
Unless this differs significantly from the fixed rate it is also deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
Where this does differ significantly, the fair value is based on the discounted value of future cash flows.
For equity instruments listed on a recognised stock exchange the fair value is the quoted market price.
For other equity instruments it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
The fair value is the quoted market price.
Where no quoted market price exists, it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
As all bear either no interest or a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
For those bearing a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
For those bearing a fixed rate of interest the fair value is either the quoted market price where a liquid market exists or has been calculated using well established pricing models.
The carrying amount is deemed to approximate to the fair value.
The fair value is based on market valuations at the balance sheet date.
This category of derivative financial instruments includes: the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts of 0.2 million 2004: 7.5 million and the fair value of natural gas futures contracts of 6.9 million 2004: nil.
The fair values are based on market prices and forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Includes foreign currency and interest rate swap agreements.
ii Hedges As explained on page 56 of the financial review under the heading management of financial risks, the Groups policies are to use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge transactional currency exposures principally arising through anticipated sales and purchase transactions and swap agreements to manage interest rate risks and hedge structural currency exposures.
Currency swaps are only held to change the currency of the Groups borrowings to match better its net investments in its overseas subsidiaries.
In accordance with the Groups accounting policies, the assets and liabilities arising from these swap agreements are translated into sterling at the spot rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
The resulting exchange gains or losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses to match the exchange gains or losses on the net investments in the overseas subsidiaries.
The carrying amount of the swap agreements as shown in note 21 b i is the result of the exchange gains and losses recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, and is analysed in the deferred gains and losses table shown below.

c Currency exposures As outlined on page 56 in the financial review under the heading currency risk, it is the Groups policy to hedge against the potential impact on its profit and loss account of the currency gains and losses arising from monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.

The floating rate financial assets, which principally comprise cash and deposits, current asset investments and loans to joint ventures and associates, carry interest based on different benchmark rates depending on the currency of the balance.
The principal benchmark rates for floating rate financial assets are LIBOR for sterling balances, US LIBOR for US dollar balances, Australian bank bill rate for Australian dollar balances, South African prime rate for South African rand balances and Japanese yen LIBOR for Japanese yen balances.

The principal benchmark rates for floating rate financial liabilities are LIBOR for sterling balances, US LIBOR for US dollar balances, Australian bank bill rate for Australian dollar balances, South African prime rate for South African rand balances and Japanese yen LIBOR for Japanese yen balances.
The maturity profile of borrowings is set out in note 20 b.
Floating rate financial liabilities other than borrowings are mainly employee incentive provisions.
These are expected to be utilised over the period to 2016 depending on the future choices of the relevant employees.
Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid principally relate to creditors due after more than one year.
The majority of the amount relates to deposits for cylinder rentals.
It is not anticipated that this balance will reduce significantly in the short to medium term.
The remaining balances falling due after more than one year are expected to be paid or utilised by 2009.

Notes to the financial statements 125 22.
Provisions for liabilities and charges continued Incentive and other employee provisions include long-term share incentive awards and deferred compensation plans.
Note 7 contains further details of the long-term share incentive units.
Provision for uninsured losses covers third party liabilities or claims.
Due to the time frame that is often involved in such claims, a significant part of this provision is subject to actuarial valuation.
Where this is not appropriate, other external assessments are used.
Environmental provisions have been set aside to cover the costs of remediation for a number of hazardous waste sites.
The costs are expected to be incurred between 2006 and 2030.
Due to the period over which this expenditure is likely to be incurred, the provision has been discounted at a rate of four per cent.
The effect of discounting is 5 million.
Management expects that payments will be approximately 7 million in 2006, approximately 3 million each year for the next four years and 12 million in total thereafter.
Management uses its judgement and experience to make an appropriate provision.
Management believes that there is no reasonable possibility of a loss materially in excess of the amounts provided.
During the year, the provision for fide-commissioning costs was reviewed.
As a result of revising previous estimates, an amount of 20.2 million was recognised for future obligations with a corresponding increase in the carrying value of tangible fixed assets.
Due to the period over which this expenditure is likely to be incurred, between 2006 and 2054, and the different regions in which it will be incurred, the provision has been discounted at rates of between four and six per cent.
The effect of discounting is 32 million.
The timing of actual expenditure will vary depending on contractual supply arrangements with customers.

b Legal proceedings BOC Group companies are parties to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including some in which claims for damages in large amounts have been asserted.
The outcome of litigation to which BOC Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen, but the directors believe that such litigation should be disposed of without material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition or profitability.
Welding fumes litigation A US subsidiary of BOC, The BOC Group, Inc. currently is party to a number of lawsuits in the US for alleged injuries resulting from exposure to manganese, asbestos and or toxic fumes in connection with the welding process.
The BOC Group, Inc. has not manufactured welding rods in the US since 1986 when the welding electrodes business was sold.
The BOC Group, Inc. ceased selling welding rods in the US manufactured by others when the sale of the US packaged gas business, including the operations that distributed packaged gases and welding equipment, was completed in July 2004.
Manganese litigation At 30 September 2005, there were a total of approximately 8,574 claimants Total Claimants in pending manganese related cases in both US federal and state courts that name The BOC Group, Inc. as a defendant, a net decrease of approximately 1,100 claimants from 30 September 2004.
The BOC Group, Inc. is typically one of several defendants in these cases that claim compensatory and punitive damages, in most cases for unspecified amounts, for alleged neurological injury, including Parkinsons disease, through exposure to manganese in welding fumes.
Of the Total Claimants, approximately 4,607 claimants have filed in, or been transferred for pre-trial purposes to, the federal district court in the Northern District of Ohio, where a multi-district litigation MDL proceeding has been commenced, and approximately 50 claimants are in process to be transferred to or from the MDL.
The MDL proceeding is a vehicle for coordinating pre-trial proceedings in cases pending in different federal district courts in the US.
It is currently contemplated that the MDL court will try three cases during the MDL proceeding.
The first such case is currently scheduled for February 2006.
In addition to the cases in federal court, The BOC Group, Inc. is a defendant in a number of similar cases pending in state courts, which are in different stages of procedural development, and certain cases are scheduled for trial from time to time.
The BOC Group, Inc. has been a co-defendant in other manganese related claims that have been resolved as follows.
From 1 January 1997 to 30 September 2005, 3,965 claims were dismissed.
Through 30 September 2005, seven cases were tried to final jury verdicts in favour of the defendants, including The BOC Group, Inc. and one case was tried to a final jury verdict in favour of the plaintiffs, which is being appealed.
Asbestos litigation At 30 September 2005, there were a total of approximately 15,966 claimants in pending asbestos related cases that name The BOC Group, Inc. as a defendant, a net decrease of approximately 600 from 30 September 2004.
The BOC Group, Inc. is typically one of a large number of defendants in these cases that claim compensatory and punitive damages, in most cases for unspecified amounts, for alleged injuries, including cancer, through exposure to asbestos in welding fumes or from welding consumables.
A very small number of these claimants allege injuries from exposure to asbestos in non-welding rod products and premises.
The BOC Group, Inc. has been a co-defendant in other asbestos related claims that have been resolved as follows.
From 1 January 1997 to 30 September 2005, 11,776 claims were dismissed and 75 claims were dismissed on summary judgments.
Through 30 September 2005, nine cases were tried to final jury verdicts in favour of the defendants, including The BOC Group, Inc. and one case was tried to a final jury verdict in favour of the plaintiffs, which is being appealed.
The BOC Group, Inc. believes that it has strong defences to the claims asserted in all of the various manganese and asbestos related cases and intends to defend vigorously such claims.
In the manganese related claims, The BOC Group, Inc. believes that recent relevant scientific literature, based on epidemiological studies, strongly supports its defence of such claims.
Based on its experience to date, together with its current assessment of the merits of the claims being asserted and applicable insurance, BOC believes that continued defence and resolution of the welding fumes litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or profitability and no provision has been made.
Nonetheless, it is not possible to predict either the number of future claims or the number of claimants that any future claims may present.
In addition, the outcome of welding fume cases, either involving BOC or other defendants, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict, and BOC cannot provide any assurances that any future resolutions of these types of claims will necessarily be consistent with its experience to date.
In the event of an adverse outcome to any of the proceedings, a liability would be recognised if it was considered likely that it would give rise to an outflow of future economic benefits.
Where there is applicable insurance, this would be recognised when its recoverability was virtually certain.
Fluorogas litigation The Fluorogas litigation is now settled and is no longer the subject of any legal proceedings.

In March 2005, BOC acquired 50 per cent of Maanshan BOC-Ma Steel Gases Co Limited, the joint venture formed to supply the industrial gases needs of Ma Steel in China.
During 2005, BOC made an additional equity investment in Compania fide Nitrogeno fide Cantarell CNC in proportion to its 65 per cent equity shareholding.
In March 2005, BOCs South African subsidiary, African Oxygen Limited Afrox completed the sale of its majority shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited to a consortium led by two major black empowerment groups.
Profit on disposal of this business amounted to 84.9 million.
Afrox has retained a significant interest in the hospitals business through a 20 per cent holding in the new company.
Following this disposal, Afrox accounts for its share of the business on an equity basis, taking its share of operating profit and net interest into account.
In 2005, the Group also recognised a further 13.2 million profit on disposal of the US packaged gas business.
The additional proceeds, received in November 2005, had been subject to certain conditions at the time of disposal in July 2004.
In December 2004, BOC, through its subsidiary Thai Industrial Gases Public Co Limited, sold its shares in Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Public Co Limited.

Related party transactions During the year, interest income of 13.8 million 2004: 7.3 million, 2003: 7.6 million was received from the Cantarell joint venture in Mexico.
During the year, the Group was invoiced 45.9 million in respect of purchases of production plants from Linde BOC Process Plants in the US.
At 30 September 2005, 1.9 million was payable in respect of these invoices.
No material purchases were made in 2004 or 2003.
The Group had no other material related party transactions that might reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the users of these accounts.
132 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Notes to the financial statements 30.
US accounting information a Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles and other US accounting information The financial statements of The BOC Group plc are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK UK GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the US US GAAP.
Set out below is a summary of the more significant adjustments which would be required if US GAAP had been applied, together with reconciliations of net profit and shareholders funds from a UK GAAP to a US GAAP basis.
Also presented on a US GAAP basis are a movement in shareholders funds, a consolidated cash flow statement, information on earnings per share, information on stock based compensation and details of recently issued US accounting pronouncements.
Goodwill and other intangible assets Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1998 accounted for under the purchase method has been eliminated against shareholders funds.
Additionally, UK GAAP requires that on subsequent disposal or closure of a business, any goodwill previously taken directly to shareholders funds is then charged against income.
The Group adopted FRS10 in 1999, which requires goodwill on subsequent acquisitions to be capitalised and amortised over a period not exceeding 20 years.
Under UK GAAP the Group has recognised negative goodwill on certain acquisitions.
Under US GAAP, the excess of the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the acquisition cost is adjusted against the values of the acquired long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS 141.
This does not result in a difference between the shareholders funds under UK GAAP and US GAAP, although there is a difference in the classification between tangible and intangible assets.
Under US GAAP SFAS142 goodwill continues to be capitalised, although no amortisation is charged to the income statement.
Instead, an annual impairment test is carried out, with any identified impairment loss recorded in the income statement.
Other intangible assets with a finite life continue to be amortised under both UK and US GAAP.
UK GAAP is highly prescriptive with regard to the recognition of intangible assets, although US GAAP rules result in the recognition of a greater amount of intangible assets.
Therefore, differences arise in the classification of some intangible assets and goodwill between UK and US GAAP.
Amortisation that has been charged against goodwill under UK GAAP is added back in the reconciliation to net income on a US GAAP basis.
The average life of other intangible assets is ten years and the annual amortisation charge under US GAAP is expected to be approximately 1 million.
Impairment of goodwill Under UK GAAP, goodwill impairment reviews are carried out at the end of the first financial year following an acquisition, and also when an indicator of impairment exists.
The impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill with the higher of the net realisable value and the value in use.
Under US GAAP, goodwill impairment reviews are also conducted when an indicator of impairment exists, in addition to an annual goodwill impairment test, as required by SFAS142.
The impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its fair value.
Where the carrying value is greater than the fair value, the impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of goodwill in the reporting unit over the implied fair value of the goodwill.
Profit or loss on the partial disposal of Group companies Under UK GAAP UITF 31, gains on the partial disposal of Group companies involving non-monetary consideration are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under US GAAP, such gains and losses are recorded in the income statement.
Deferred tax Under UK GAAP, full provision for deferred tax is recognised in the financial statements.
Under US GAAP, deferred tax is recognised on a similar basis.
In addition, however, US GAAP requires provision for deferred tax on the unremitted earnings of overseas businesses that are not deemed to be permanently reinvested.
This is not permitted under UK GAAP except in respect of any dividends that have been accrued as receivable.
Revaluation of fixed assets UK GAAP allowed for the periodic revaluation of land and buildings with depreciation then being calculated on the revalued amount.
Any surplus or deficit to the extent that the revaluation reserve was in surplus on the revaluation was then taken directly to shareholders funds.
With the Groups adoption of FRS15 in 2000, the Group no longer revalues fixed assets.
Under US GAAP, revaluations of fixed assets are not permitted and, as a result, the reconciliation restates fixed assets to historical cost.
The depreciation charge and any write downs of previously revalued assets are adjusted accordingly.
Impairment of tangible fixed assets Under UK GAAP, a tangible fixed asset is reviewed for impairment if an indication exists that the asset may be impaired.
If necessary, an impairment loss is recorded.
A value in use calculation is carried out, based on discounted pre-tax future cash flows from the asset or income generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Under US GAAP, a preliminary review of the tangible fixed asset is carried out using undiscounted future cash flows.
If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the assets carrying value, an impairment loss is required.
The impairment loss will be calculated using discounted future cash flows, or the assets market value.
Under US GAAP, the reversal of previously recognised impairment losses is not permitted.
Provisions Under UK GAAP, general requirements for liabilities and charges are contained in FRS 12 which states that provisions are made when a present obligation exists in respect of a past event, where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Under US GAAP the general requirements for loss contingencies of SFAS 5 require that, a provision is made when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
The UK GAAP policy is substantially the same as the US GAAP policy and no adjustment is required.
Restructuring costs Under UK GAAP, when a decision has been taken to restructure, supported by a detailed formal plan and the creation of a valid expectation in those affected that the restructuring will take place, the necessary provisions are made for impairment of asset values together with severance and other costs.
Under US GAAP SFAS146, the requirements for charging restructuring costs to income are more prescriptive and all significant actions arising from the restructuring plan and their completion dates must be identified by the balance sheet date.
Pensions For UK GAAP reporting FRS17 Retirement benefits, the pension asset or liability in the balance sheet represents the difference between the market value of pension scheme assets at the balance sheet date and the present value of pension scheme liabilities at that date, net of deferred tax.
Under US GAAP SFAS87, plan assets are valued by reference to market-related value at the date of the financial statements.
Liabilities are assessed using the rate of return obtainable on fixed or inflation-linked bonds.
FRS17 requires that past service costs are recognised in full in the period in which they become vested.
SFAS87 requires past service costs to be amortised over the remaining service lives of the employees to whom the amendments relate.
Notes to the financial statements 133 30.
US accounting information continued There is a significant difference in the treatment of actuarial gains and losses arising during the accounting period.
UK GAAP recognises the actuarial gains and losses in full in the year in which they arise in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under US GAAP, the actuarial gains and losses which exceed ten per cent of the value of the assets or liabilities at the start of the accounting period are amortised over the remaining service lives of scheme members.
Where an additional minimum liability exists under US GAAP, ie where the amount provided for any scheme does not cover the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation for that scheme, this must be recognised in the balance sheet under SFAS87.
The adjustment resulting from the recognition of an additional minimum liability is reported as an intangible asset to the extent of the unrecognised prior service cost, after eliminating amounts previously shown as a prepaid benefit cost.
Any excess above these amounts is reported in comprehensive income.
Where surpluses exist in pension schemes under UK GAAP, a company should recognise the associated asset only to the extent that it is able to recover that surplus either through reduced contributions or through refunds from the scheme.
Regulations in South Africa concerning surpluses as set out in the Pension Funds Second Amendment Act 2001 specify that recognition of any surpluses in a retirement fund cannot be made by a company unless it is either as a result of a surplus apportionment exercise, or if a funds rules allow it.
As a result, any surpluses in South Africa are not recognised under UK GAAP and are written off in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
There is no specific requirement under US GAAP relating to the treatment of irrecoverable surpluses.
As a result, the associated surplus is retained under US GAAP in line with SFAS 87.
Post retirement medical costs For UK GAAP reporting FRS17 Retirement benefits, the post retirement medical liability is discounted using the bond yield on suitable high quality corporate bonds, and disclosed net of related deferred tax.
For US GAAP SFAS106, the liabilities are assessed and discounted using the rates of return obtainable on high quality fixed income investments.
Differences between the UK and US GAAP figures arise largely from the treatment of actuarial gains and losses.
Securities investments Under UK GAAP, current asset investments of all types are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, or alternatively, at market value or at directors valuation.
Under US GAAP, securities which are determined to be available-for-sale are stated at fair value and any unrealised gains or losses included as a separate component of shareholders funds.
The deferred tax consequences of unrealised gains or losses are also charged or credited to shareholders funds.
Contingent consideration Under UK GAAP, contingent consideration is provided for as a liability when the likelihood of payment is considered to be probable.
Under US GAAP, contingent consideration is not recognised until the liability is determined beyond reasonable doubt.
The elimination of contingent consideration for US GAAP purposes also impacts on the value of goodwill arising on acquisitions, therefore there is no net impact on shareholders funds.
Financial instruments The Group enters into a number of currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to currency and interest rate risks.
Under UK GAAP, such instruments are shown at their carrying value.
Under US GAAP, these instruments are marked to market and any change in value is recognised in either the income statement or through comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS133 depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if it is, the type of hedge transaction.
Accounting for swaps Under UK GAAP, gains or losses on closing out interest rate swap contracts taken to hedge the Groups fixed floating interest rate position can be taken to profit immediately.
US GAAP requires any gain or loss to be deferred over the remaining hedge period.
Share of results and net assets of joint ventures and associates The Groups share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates as calculated under UK GAAP is shown within fixed asset investments.
For the purposes of the reconciliations set out below, the Groups share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates has been adjusted to recognise a difference in the method of reporting profits under US GAAP.
Leasing Under US GAAP EITF 018 certain arrangements with customers modified or entered into since 1 October 2003 concerning the use of some items of the Groups plant and machinery are deemed to contain leases.
Where such arrangements qualify as finance leases under SFAS13, an appropriate adjustment is made to net income and shareholders funds under US GAAP.
UK GAAP does not contain this same requirement.
Sale and leaseback transactions Under UK GAAP, any profit or loss on the sale and operating leaseback of fixed assets can generally be taken to profit immediately.
US GAAP requires any gain or loss to be deferred over the contract lease period.
Comprehensive income Under US GAAP, SFAS130 establishes requirements for the reporting of comprehensive income and its components revenue, expenses, gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements.
Components of comprehensive income for the Group determined on a UK GAAP basis include profit for the financial year, pension actuarial gains and losses, and foreign currency translation gains and losses.
Information regarding the Groups foreign currency translation gains and losses is included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses under UK GAAP on page 89. b Selected financial information under US GAAP In addition to the Group five year record on page 12, for SEC reporting the Group is required to disclose, on a US GAAP basis, certain key selected financial information under item 3.

The adjustment on profit of disposal of subsidiary of 20.7 million in 2003 relates to differences relating to the combination of the Groups Japanese gases business with part of Air Liquide Japan.
It comprises 11.7 million relating to the difference in the net book value of tangible assets and 9.0 million relating to the difference in the net book value of intangible assets recognised in the Groups Japanese business.
The adjustment on disposal of the US packaged gas business of 39.9 million in 2004 comprised 13.4 million relating to asset impairments, 19.9 million relating to goodwill and 6.6 million relating to restructuring provisions.
In 2005, the adjustment relates to timing differences on restructuring provisions and expenses between UK GAAP and US GAAP.
During 2005 the deferred tax provision in respect of undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures was reviewed.
In connection with this, the amount of taxation adjustments includes a charge of 28.5 million 2004: nil, 2003: nil.
All net income arose from continuing operations.

The principal differences between the standards relate to classification of items within the cash flow statement and with regard to the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Under FRS1, cash flows are presented separately for: a operating activities: b dividends from joint ventures and associates: c returns on investments and servicing of finance: d tax paid: e capital expenditure and financial investment: f acquisitions and disposals: g equity dividends paid: h management of liquid resources: and i financing.
Under SFAS95, however, only three categories of cash flow activity are reported: a operating activities: b investing activities: and c financing activities.
Dividends from joint ventures and associates, cash flows from returns on investments and servicing of finance excluding dividends paid to minorities and tax paid under FRS1 would be included in operating activities under SFAS95: capital expenditure and acquisitions and disposals would be included in investing activities under SFAS95: equity dividends would be included as a financing activity under SFAS95.
Under FRS1, cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand with any qualifying financial institution, less overdrafts from any qualifying financial institution repayable on demand.
Under SFAS95, cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits but also includes cash equivalents which are short-term, highly liquid investments.
Generally only investments with original maturities of three months or less come within this definition.
136 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Notes to the financial statements 30.
US accounting information continued Set out below, for illustrative purposes, is a summary consolidated statement of cash flows under SFAS95.
2005 2004 2003 million million million Net cash provided by operating activities 577.7 673.5 562.4 Net cash used by investing activities 235.2 45.2 389.2 Net cash used by financing activities 405.7 413.0 292.7 Net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents 63.2 215.3 119.5 Cash and cash equivalents at 1 October 289.7 76.4 181.9 Exchange and other movements 1.4 2.0 14.0 Cash and cash equivalents at 30 September 225.1 289.7 76.4 h Stock-based compensation For US reporting purposes the company applies APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations, in accounting for its share option plans.
Prior to 2005, by applying this statement, the employee share schemes were deemed non-compensatory since share options were granted at a discount of ten per cent to market price.
Accordingly, grants under these schemes did not result in an expense under US GAAP.
In 2005, share options under the companys employee share schemes were granted at a discount of 20 per cent to the market price.
Accordingly, they are deemed compensatory, which has resulted in a charge of 0.2 million 0.1 million net of related tax in 2005 2004: nil, 2003: nil.
Grants of executive share options are made at the market price of the companys shares at the time of grant and are therefore deemed non-compensatory.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan schemes are deemed compensatory and a charge is recognised when certain performance conditions are met.
This has resulted in a charge of 6.1 million 4.3 million net of related tax in 2005 2004: nil, 2003: nil.
If compensation cost for the Groups share option plans had been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with the method of SFAS123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Groups net income under US GAAP would have been: 2005 2004 2003 million million million Reported net income 326.7 297.7 264.3 Add stock compensation expense recognised in accordance with APB25 net of related tax 4.4 Deduct stock compensation expense determined in accordance with SFAS123 net of related tax 9.7 5.7 7.1 Pro forma net income 321.4 292.0 257.2 2005 2004 2003 pence pence pence Earnings per share: Basic as reported 66.0 60.4 53.7 Basic pro forma 64.9 59.2 52.2 Diluted as reported 65.8 60.3 53.6 Diluted pro forma 64.7 59.1 52.2 The Black-Scholes model was used to measure the compensation expense under SFAS123.
The assumptions used for grants in 2005 included a dividend yield of 4.5 per cent 2004: 4.5 per cent, 2003: 4.5 per cent, expected share price volatility of 27.2 per cent 2004: 29.5 per cent, 2003: 30.6 per cent, a weighted average expected life of 4.9 years 2004: 4.9 years, 2003: 5.0 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.6 per cent 2004: 4.8 per cent, 2003: 4.0 per cent.
The weighted average interest rate is based on UK Gilts on the date of grant with a maturity similar to the related options.
i Goodwill For US reporting purposes the company applies SFAS142 in accounting for goodwill.
The changes in the carrying value of goodwill for the year ended 30 September 2005 are as follows: Industrial Process and Special BOC Afrox Gas Solutions Products Edwards hospitals Gist Corporate Total million million million million million million million Balance at 1 October 55.8 79.1 109.0 15.0 0.7 2.5 262.1 Acquired during year 1.0 2.6 0.5 5.1 9.2 Disposals during year 0.6 15.7 14.5 30.8 Impairments in year 31.1 31.1 Exchange adjustment 3.6 5.2 0.2 1.0 0.3 7.9 Balance at 30 September 59.8 71.2 77.7 6.1 2.5 217.3 Under US GAAP the fair values of the business for impairment testing purposes have been calculated using a discounted cash flow method.
See note 2 b for further information.
j Operating leases lessors The following table provides information required in respect of owned assets which qualify as operating leases under SFAS13.

k Recently issued accounting pronouncements implemented in the year EITF041 Accounting for Pre-existing relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination In October 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a consensus on EITF issue 041.
Issue 041 applies when two parties that have a pre-existing contractual relationship enter into a business combination.
If it is determined that assets of an acquired entity are related to a pre-existing contractual relationship, thus requiring accounting separate from the business combination, management will evaluate whether the acquiring entity of the Group should recognise contractual relationships as assets separate from goodwill in that business combination.
EITF 041 did not have a material impact on the Groups results and financial position in the year.
l Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet implemented SFAS151 Inventory costs SFAS151 was issued in November 2004 and is effective for all inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after 15 June 2005.
This statement amends ARB 43 and requires all idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight and re-handling costs to be recognised as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as previously stated in ARB 43.
In addition, ARB 43 requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.
Unallocated overheads are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Management does not believe that this statement will have a material effect on the Groups results and financial position under US GAAP in future periods.
SFAS153 Exchanges of non-monetary assets SFAS153 was issued in December 2004 and is effective for all non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after15 June 2005.
This statement amends APB Opinion 29, which is based on the principle that exchanges of non-monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged.
SFAS153 provides a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity.
SFAS123 R Share-based payment revised 2004 SFAS123 R was issued in December 2004 and is effective for the first annual reporting period that starts after 15 June 2005.
It supersedes APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
SFAS123 R is concerned with how to account for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services.
It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments.
The main effect of this revised standard is a move from an intrinsic value method to a fair value based method.
It will therefore result in an additional charge relating to the fair value of share options in the Groups income statement.
Management does not believe that this will have a material effect on the Groups results and financial position under US GAAP in future periods.
SFAS154 Accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No.
SFAS154 was issued in May 2005 and is effective for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2005.
This statement replaces APB Opinion 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.
This Statement requires voluntary changes in accounting principles to be reported via retrospective application, unless impracticable.
Previous guidance given in APB Opinion 20 for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements or a change in accounting estimates is unchanged in SFAS154.
FIN47 Accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations FIN47 was issued in August 2005 and is effective for fiscal years ending after 15 December 2005.
This interpretation clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in SFAS143, Accounting for asset retirement obligations.
FIN47 requires an entity to recognise a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated.
The fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognised when incurred - generally upon acquisition, construction, or development and or through the normal operation of the asset.
Uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists.
Management does not believe that this interpretation will have a material effect on the Groups results and financial position under US GAAP in future periods.
m Other information Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
