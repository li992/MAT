15.6% 17.8% The adjustments to include life subsidiaries on a statutory solvency basis reflect the difference between the adjusted net worth of each life subsidiary on the statutory basis as required by the local regulator and their portion of the groups consolidated equity shareholders funds.
In Africa, the adjusted net worth excludes items that are eliminated or shown separately on consolidation such as Nedbank, Mutual & Federal and inter-company loans.
The return on adjusted Group embedded value is calculated as the adjusted operating profit after tax and minorities of 796 million together with an expected equity return on the pro-forma adjustment of 66 million less 20 million adjustment for hybrid capital accrued dividends, divided by the opening adjusted Group embedded value.

Perpetual preferred securities and debt are included in the adjusted Group embedded value on a basis that is consistent with the primary accounts.
The value of perpetual preferred callable securities is not deducted in the primary accounts but is deducted in the adjusted Group embedded value.
The impact of marking all debt to market value would be a reduction in adjusted Group embedded value of 62 million as at 31 December 2005 and an increase in adjusted Group embedded value of 23 million as at 31 December 2004.

The adjusted net worth includes goodwill relating to the North American life subsidiaries of 66 million December 2004: 59 million.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 209 European Embedded Value supplementary information for the year ended 31 December 2005 continued 6 BASIS OF PREPARATION This supplementary information has been prepared in accordance with the European Embedded Value EEV Principles issued in May 2004 by the European Chief Financial Officers Forum.
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the preparation of this supplementary information.
The comparative figures for the financial year ended 31 December 2004 were presented in the 20 June 2005 EEV press release.
However, where necessary, certain comparatives have been restated to ensure consistency in preparation and presentation of results.
Covered business is defined as the long-term business in the primary financial statements.
This business covers life insurance, long-term healthcare and accident insurance, savings, pensions and annuity business written by the life insurance subsidiaries.
The results of Group companies providing administration and distribution services have been included to the extent that they relate to the covered business.
The results do not include services provided by Group investment management companies.
Unallocated Group holding company expenses have been included to the extent that they relate to the covered business.
The treatment within this supplementary information of all business other than the covered business is unchanged from the primary financial statements on an IFRS basis.
Under the EEV methodology, profit is recognised as it is earned over the life of products defined within the covered business.
The embedded value of the covered business is the sum of the shareholders adjusted net worth in respect of the covered business, and the value of the in-force covered business.
The group embedded value includes the value of all other business at the book value detailed in the primary financial statements on an IFRS basis.
The adjusted Group embedded value, a measure used by management to assess the shareholders interest in the value of the Group, includes the Groups listed banking and general insurance subsidiaries at market value as well as the value of group equity and debt instruments held in life funds, less perpetual preferred callable securities.
The value of future payments due in respect of the share ownership of Black Economic Empowerment partners is also included.
The adjusted net worth of the covered business is the market value of shareholders assets held in respect of the covered business, and consists of the required capital and free surplus.
The level of required capital of the covered business reflects the level of capital considered by the Directors to be appropriate to manage the business allowing for minimum local or Group statutory requirements or equivalent where there is no local requirement, our internal assessment of the market, insurance and operational risk inherent in the underlying products and the level of capital required by rating agencies in respect of our North American business in order to maintain the desired credit rating.
The level of required capital is on average 147%, and 247% of the minimum local statutory requirements in Africa and North America respectively as at 31 December 2005.
The free surplus comprises the market value of assets allocated to the covered business in excess of the required capital.
The required capital in respect of the South African covered business is partially covered by the market value of the Groups investments in Banking and General Insurance in South Africa.
On consolidation these investments are shown separately.
The value of in-force covered business is the present value at the appropriate risk discount rate which incorporates a risk margin of the statutory distributable profits to shareholders projected to arise from the in-force covered business on a best estimate basis, less a deduction for the cost of holding the required level of capital.
Statutory distributable profit arises from the difference between amounts charged to policyholders for guarantees, expenses and insurance and the actual experience of these items, together with the investment return earned on shareholders assets.
Allowance has been made for the cost intrinsic value of financial options and guarantees to policyholders in the local statutory reserves according to local requirements.
In South Africa an investment guarantee reserve on a stochastic basis is included in the local statutory reserves.
Where necessary, a deduction from the value of in-force has been made to allow for the impact of future variability of investment returns on the cost of policyholder financial options and guarantees time-value to the extent that it is not already included in the statutory reserves.
This time value has been determined using stochastic modelling techniques and represents the difference between the average value of shareholder cash flows under many generated economic scenarios and the deterministic shareholder value under the best estimate assumptions.
In the generated economic scenarios allowance is made, where appropriate, for the effect of management and or policyholder actions in different circumstances.
As at 31 December 2005 no separate cost of financial options and guarantees was shown as a deduction from the value of in-force business for Africa, as this cost was fully covered in the statutory reserves.
The risk margin above the risk-free rates for the African and North American life covered businesses were 2.3% p. a. and 3.2% p. a. respectively.
The directors believe that the embedded value of the covered business is broadly market-consistent.

The effect of changes in and cost of required capital for Africa reflects changes in the amount of required capital and in the mix of assets backing the capital.
The transfers from covered business include the purchase of additional shares in Nedbank, an increase in intercompany loans, dividend payments, as well as head office expenses.
The embedded value for the Africa covered business is after the adjustment for market value of Group equity and debt instruments held in life funds.
Return on adjusted embedded value is the adjusted operating profit after tax divided by opening embedded value in SA Rand.

Annual Premium Equivalent APE is calculated as recurring premiums plus 10% of single premiums.
New business profitability is measured by both the ratio of the VNB to the APE as well as to the Present Value of new business premiums PVNBP, and shown under Margin below.
PVNBP is defined as the present value of regular premiums plus single premiums for any given period.
It is calculated using the same assumptions as for the value of new business.

At At 31 December 31 December 2005 2004 Africa Risk-free rate 10 year Government bond 7.6% 8.3% Cash return 5.6% 6.3% Equity return 11.1% 11.8% Property return 9.1% 9.8% Inflation 4.6% 5.3% Risk discount rate 9.9% 10.6% Risk margin 2.3% 2.3% North America Risk free rate 10 year Treasury yield 4.4% 4.3% Inflation 3.0% 3.0% New money yield assumed 5.5% 5.1% Average portfolio earned rate 5.6% 5.9% Risk discount rate 7.6% 7.5% Risk margin 3.2% 3.2% The pre-tax investment and economic assumptions are updated every six months to reflect the economic conditions prevailing on the valuation date.
Risk-free rates have a duration similar to that of the underlying liabilities.
Equity and property risk premiums incorporate both historical relationships and the Directors view of future projected returns in each geography.
The risk margins have been calculated using a bottom-up market consistent approach, and reflect the distinctive risks of the products in the respective business units.
The calibration of the risk margins was not redone for December 2005, and the same risk margins were used as for December 2004.
Where applicable, rates of future bonuses or crediting rates have been set at levels consistent with the investment return assumptions.
Projected company taxation is based on the current tax basis that applies in each country.
For the South African business, full allowance has been made for Secondary Tax on Companies STC that may be payable.
Account has been taken of the impact of CGT in South Africa.
It has been assumed that 10% of the equity portfolio excluding group subsidiaries will be traded each year.
For North America full allowance has been made for existing tax attributes of the companies, including the use of existing carryforwards and preferred tax credit investments.
For the purposes of the summary income statement the adjusted operating profit for the covered business has been grossed up for tax.
The tax rates used were the effective corporation tax rates of 35% for Africa and 33% for North America and 20% for the UK and Rest of World, except for the investment return on African capital, for which the attributed tax was derived from the financial statements.
The value of new business for North America is based on the expected long-term tax position.
Both operating profit and new business are calculated on closing assumptions.
For the African business, the required capital is calculated independently in each of the major business units.
The non-investment items are based on a multiple of the non-investment components of the local Statutory Capital Adequacy Requirements set out in PGN104 issued by the Actuarial Society of South Africa ASSA.
The investment item is based on internal models developed for capital allocation and pricing purposes.
The models project assets and liabilities for the business forward for 10 years using stochastically determined investment returns on a realistic basis.
Bonus rates and adjustments to non-vested bonuses are determined using a consistent formula based on a weighted average of past returns and the level of the Bonus Smoothing Account BSA at the time.
To the extent that the BSA falls to lower than normally allowable minimum levels, the shareholder is considered to be required to provide support to the business, and the capital requirement is based on the discounted value of the maximum shareholder support in the 99th worst percentile case.
The required capital is invested in local equities, local cash and international cash.
The asset allocation as at 31 December 2005 is 60%, 20% and 20% respectively.
For the North American business, the required capital is based on the multiple of the local Risk Based Capital RBC requirement that management deems necessary to maintain the desired credit rating for the company in question.
The multiples vary by company from 200% to 300% and average 247% as at 31 December 2005.
The required capital for Old Mutual Bermuda Limited and Old Mutual Reassurance Ireland Limited in Ireland is based on the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority statutory requirements to ensure that the Group maintains adequate solvency capital in terms of the European Union Financial Groups Directive.
The required capital is invested in fixed interest assets.
The required capital of Old Mutual International, based in Guernsey, is set at the maximum of 1% of funds under management and 10 million, a level considered by the directors to be appropriate to manage the business.
The required capital is invested in short-dated fixed interest assets.
Old Mutual plc 216 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 10 ASSUMPTIONS continued The assumed future mortality, morbidity and voluntary discontinuance rates have been based as far as possible on analyses of recent operating experience.
Allowance has been made where appropriate for the effect of expected AIDS-related claims.
The management expenses attributable to life assurance business have been analysed between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business and the maintenance of business in-force.
The future expenses attributable to life assurance business include 23% of the Group holding company expenses, with 18% allocated to Africa and 5% allocated to North America.
The allocation of these expenses aligns to the proportion that the management expenses incurred by the business bears to the total management expenses incurred in the Group.
No allowance has been made for future productivity improvements in the expense assumptions.
No development expenses have been excluded from the calculations and no material allowance has been made for future development expenses.
Future investment expenses are based on the current scales of fees payable by the life assurance companies to the asset management subsidiaries.
To the extent that these fees include profit margins for the asset management subsidiaries, these margins have not been included in the value of in-force business or the value of new business.
The effect of increases in premiums over the period for policies in-force has been included in the value of in-force business only where such increases are associated with indexation arrangements.
Other increases in premiums of existing policies are included in the value of new business.
New schemes written on which recurring single premiums are expected to be received on a regular basis are treated as new business.
The annualised premium is recognised as recurring premium new business at inception of the scheme and is determined by annualising the actual premiums received during the year in question.
Subsequent recurring single premiums received in future years are not treated as new business, as these have already been provided for in calculating the value of in-force business.
The value of new business has been accumulated to the period end.
The sensitivity of the value of in-force and value of new business to changes in the central risk discount rate are set out in section 11.
The principal exchange rates used to translate the operating results of key foreign business segments to Sterling are: Rand US$ Year to Year to Year to Year to 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2005 2004 2005 2004 Profit and loss account average rate 11.5812 11.7986 1.8195 1.8327 Balance sheet closing rate 10.8923 10.8482 1.7187 1.9158 Balance sheet opening rate 10.8482 11.9367 1.9158 1.7833 The time-value of the financial options and guarantees in the African businesses have been valued using a random walk, log-normal real world stochastic asset model that is in keeping with the applicable professional guidance notes issued by the Actuarial Society of South Africa ASSA.
The time-value reserves relate mainly to the guarantees detailed below: Individual business A closed block of unit-linked type and with-profit business has an underlying minimum growth rate guarantee 4.28% pa for life and endowment business and 4.78% pa for retirement annuity business applicable when calculating death, disability and maturity claims.
A small block of with-profit business guarantees minimum values to the policyholder at a point in time, generally 5 years from inception.
If the guarantee is not exercised, another guarantee may be set.
A small block of with-profit savings business in Group Schemes that has death guarantees of premiums net of fees plus 4.25% pa investment return.
Retirement annuities sold prior to June 1997 contain guaranteed annuity options, whereby the policyholder has an option to exchange full retirement proceeds for a minimum level of annuity income at maturity.
This option only applies at the normal maturity date where the full proceeds no cash benefit taken are used to purchase an annuity in the exact form specified in the policy contract.
In addition, with-profits business has vested bonus guarantees at certain future dates which operate in conjunction with the options and guarantees set out above.
Group business There is a significant pre-retirement savings with-profit portfolio.
Vested bonuses affect the calculation of benefit payments when a member exits from the scheme as the face value is paid out.
If a scheme terminates, the lower of face and market value is paid out and the vested bonuses are not guaranteed.
A significant with-profit annuity in payment portfolio guarantees annuity payments once declared for the life-time of the annuitant.
The mean returns and volatilities of the asset classes incorporated in the stochastic asset model are detailed below.
Correlations between asset classes have been based on an internal assessment of historical relationships.

Standard deviations have been calculated by accumulating returns for the required period in each scenario, taking the natural log of the result, calculating the variance of this statistic, dividing by the projection period n years and taking the square root.
This makes the result comparable to implied volatilities quoted in investment markets.
The time-value of the financial options and guarantees in the North American businesses have been valued as at 31 December 2004 using the generalised real world stochastic variance model with mean reversion that was developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC, based on a study of interest rates during the period 1951 to 1995.
The model assumes that the absolute difference between short and long-term rates are normally distributed.
In addition for its Equity Index Annuity products a set of stochastic equity scenarios with a mean return of 8.9% and a standard deviation of 16%, is used to project policyholder returns as governed by product features.
The model results were adjusted to allow for the interest rates from 1995 to 2005.
The time-value of the financial options and guarantees as at 31 December 2005 has been assumed to be consistent with that as at 31 December 2004.
Detailed calculations will be performed once the new actuarial systems, that provide an enhanced stochastic capability, are implemented.
The time value reserves relate mainly to the guarantees detailed below: Crediting rates declared for the fixed deferred annuity block of business vest fully.
They are subject to a minimum crediting rate which is specified in the contract.
Minimum surrender values are determined by this rate.
Equity indexed annuities offer minimum crediting rates on the fixed portion of the product, minimum surrender values based on this and credit equity participation annually as a percentage of equity growth subject to a maximum.
This equity participation, which is subject to a minimum of 0% therefore vests annually.
The variable annuities offered to off-shore customers through Old Mutual Bermuda can offer minimum death benefit guarantees.
Death benefits are subject to a minimum of the sum invested or value at any anniversary date if greater.
A small proportion of variable annuity clients elect a minimum guaranteed account value on maturity.
The universal life policies specify a minimum crediting rate to accumulate account balances.
All deferred annuities offer a guaranteed annuitisation option on maturity.
The rates are set conservatively and typically have very low utilisation as customers in the United States value the choice inherent in a lump-sum payment.
The reserves for financial options and guarantees assume that the low historical take-up rates of around 1% p. a. will continue into the future, and are therefore insignificant.
Certain of the universal life contracts contain a feature that guarantee that the contact will continue, even if values would otherwise be insufficient, provided the customer has paid at least a stated amount of premium.
The mean returns and volatilities of Treasuries along the yield curve are detailed below.
The mean-reversion to higher future interest rates inherent in the model is consistent with current forward rates.
The interest rate scenarios generated by the model range from 0% to 20%.
Treasuries Mean interest rate Standard deviation 6 months 4.7% 2.8% 1 year 5.0% 2.8% 5 year 5.5% 2.5% 10 year 5.8% 2.4% 20 year 6.0% 2.3% Means have been calculated as the annualised arithmetic average return across all simulations for each duration.
Standard deviations relate to the change in yield.
Old Mutual plc 218 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 11 ALTERNATIVE ASSUMPTIONS The tables below for Africa and North America show the sensitivity of the value of in-force at 31 December 2005 and the value of new business for the year to 31 December 2005 to changes in key assumptions.
All calculations include the impact on the time-value reserves necessary for policyholder financial options and guarantees.
For each sensitivity illustrated, all other assumptions have been left unchanged.
The sensitivity showing the impact of a 100 bps increase in the yield on equities property as a change in the equity property risk premium is not given below as a bottom-up market consistent approach was adopted for calibrating discount rates.
