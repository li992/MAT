Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources estimates Introduction The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates presented in this report are prepared in accordance with the Anglo American plc Policy for the Reporting of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources.
This policy requires that the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 2004 edition the JORC Code be used as a minimum standard.
Some AA plc subsidiaries have a primary listing in South Africa where public reporting is carried out according to the South African Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 2000 edition the SAMREC Code.
The SAMREC Code is similar to the JORC Code and the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource terminology appearing in this section follows the definitions in both the JORC 2004 and SAMREC 2000 Codes.
The information on Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources were prepared by or under the supervision of Competent Persons as defined in the JORC or SAMREC Codes.
All Competent Persons have sufficient experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which he she is undertaking.
All the Competent Persons consent to the inclusion in this report of the matters based on their information in the form and context in which it appears.
The names of the Competent Persons are lodged with the Anglo American plc company secretaries in London and are available on request.
Anglo American Group Companies are subject to a comprehensive programme of audits aimed at providing assurance in respect of Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates.
The audits are conducted by suitably qualified competent persons from within a particular division, another division of the Company or from independent consultants.
The frequency and depth of the audits is a function of the risks and or uncertainties associated with a particular Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource, the overall value thereof and time that has lapsed since an independent third party audit has been conducted.
Those operations projects subject to independent, third party audits during the year are indicated in footnotes to the tables.
The JORC and SAMREC Codes require the use of reasonable economic assumptions.
These include long-range commodity price forecasts which are prepared by in-house specialists largely using estimates of future supply and demand and long term economic outlooks.
Ore Reserve estimates are dynamic and are influenced by changing economic conditions, technical issues, environmental regulations and relevant new information and therefore can vary from year to year.
Mineral Resource estimates also change and tend to be influenced mostly by new information pertaining to the understanding of the deposit and secondly the conversion to Ore Reserves.
The estimates of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources are as at 31 December 2005.
Unless otherwise stated, Mineral Resources are additional to those resources which have been modified to produce the Ore Reserves.
The figures in the tables have been rounded and, if used to derive totals and averages, could cause minor computational differences.
Ore Reserves in the context of this report have the same meaning as Mineral Reserves as defined by the SAMREC Code.
Metric units are used throughout the report, in addition Imperial units are also used for Anglo Platinum and AngloGold Ashanti.
In South Africa, the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act, Number 28 of 2002 MPRDA was implemented on 1 May 2004, and effectively transferred custodianship of the previously privately held mineral rights to the State.
Mining companies were given up to two years to apply for prospecting permit conversions and five years to apply for mining licence conversions for existing operations and one year for unused old order mineral rights unused old order mineral rights were mineral titles legally held at the time of the MPRDA implementation, but where no previous application had been made for a prospecting permit or a mining licence under the previous Minerals Act.
A Prospecting Right is a new order right that is valid for up to five years that can be obtained either by the conversion of existing old order prospecting licences or through new applications.
An Exploration Right is identical to a Prospecting Right, but is commodity specific in respect of petroleum and gas.
A Mining Right is a new order right valid for up to thirty years obtained either by the conversion of an old order mining licence, or as a new order right pursuant to the exercise of the exclusive right to apply for a new order Prospecting Right.
A Production Right is identical to a Mining Right but is commodity specific in respect of petroleum and gas.
Relinquished Mineral Rights: Anglo American plc has relinquished certain unused old order mineral rights to the State by not applying for new order rights over specific properties previously held under mineral title.
In preparing the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource statement, Anglo American plc has adopted the following reporting principles in respect of South African Prospecting and Mining Rights: where application for new order Mining and Prospecting Rights have been submitted and these are still being processed, the relevant resources and reserves have been included in the statement: where applications for new order Mining and Prospecting Rights have not yet been submitted and the required deadline for submission has not passed, the relevant reserves and resources have been included in the statement: where applications for new order Prospecting Rights have been initially refused and are the subject of ongoing review and discussions with the relevant authorities, and where Anglo American plc has reasonable expectations that the rights will be granted in due course, the relevant reserves and resources have been included in the statement and where relevant appear in the footnotes: and where old order mineral rights have been relinquished under the provisions of the MPRDA, the relevant resources have been excluded from the statement.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2005 | 89 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources estimates continued stated as at 31 December 2005 Platinum The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as a minimum standard.
Where relevant, the estimates were also prepared in compliance with regional codes and requirements e. g. The South African Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, The SAMREC Code, 2000.
The Mineral Resources are additional to the Ore Reserves.
Mineral Resources are reported over an economic and mineable resource cut appropriate to the specific ore deposit.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves attributable to Anglo Platinum Limited unless otherwise noted.
Anglo American plcs interest in Anglo Platinum is 74.51%.
New joint venture JV agreements have been finalised PSA2 with Aquarius Platinum South Africa and Mototolo with Xstrata.
1 The tonnage is quoted as metric tonnes and abbreviated as Mt for million tonnes.
2 Grade: 4E PGE is the sum of platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold grades in grammes per tonne.
3 Imperial units: tonnage is reported in million short tons Mton, grade in troy ounces per short ton oz t and contained metal in million troy ounces Moz.
4 Merensky Reef: The global grade decrease results from changes in stope widths applied due to improved understanding of the geology and mineralisation obtained from additional drilling.
Stope bolting has been introduced at Amandelbult Section for safety reasons, leading to an increased stope width and hence reduced grades.
5 UG2 Reef: Metal increases by 10 Moz due to the conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves and the introduction of JV Reserves.
Tonnage increases by 108 Mt mainly due to mechanised mining methods applied in the Rustenburg and Mototolo mining areas.
The overall effect is a decrease in grade.
6 Platreef: Recently encountered geotechnical constraints led to a restriction of the depth of the final pit layout at PPRust North, resulting in some of the previously reported portion of the higher grade Ore Reserves being re-allocated to Mineral Resources and necessitating a re-design of the pit.
7 Platreef stockpiles: These are reported separately as Proved Ore Reserves and aggregated into the summation tabulations.
8 Tailings: These are reported separately as Ore Reserves but are not aggregated in the total Ore Reserve figures.
The following operations projects were reviewed by an external third party consulting firm: Rustenburg Section, Amandelbult Section, PPRust North, Ga-Phasha, Styldrift and Unki.
New joint venture JV agreements have been finalised: PSA2 with Aquarius Platinum South Africa and Mototolo with Xstrata.
Pending the finalisation of a JV agreement only 50% of the Booysendal Mineral Resources are reported.
The Modikwa JV with ARM expanded and now includes the Modikwa Deeps and portions of Driekop.
Only the 50% attributable Mineral Resources to Anglo Platinum are reported.
4 Merensky Reef: Changes are mainly due to the attributable reporting of JV Merensky Reef Mineral Resources Booysendal and Modikwa.
5 UG2 Reef: Changes are mainly due to the attributable reporting of all the JV UG2 Mineral Resources.
In addition, Mineral Resources decreased due to conversion to Ore Reserves in the new PSA1 JV with Aquarius Platinum South Africa.
Disposal of Elandsfontein 440JQ to a third party resulted in a 13.6 million ounce decrease.
6 Platreef: Extensive core drilling during 2005 has increased the volume of, and confidence in, the Mineral Resources.
Zwartfontein North resources have now reached reporting status due to additional drilling and modelling.
In 2005 a 1g t cut-off has been applied for reporting Platreef Mineral Resources.
7 Tailings: These are reported separately as Mineral Resources but are not aggregated in the total Mineral Resource figures.
92 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2005 1 The tonnage is quoted as metric tonnes and abbreviated as Mt for million tonnes.
2 Grade: 4E PGE is the sum of platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold grades in grammes per tonne, 3E PGE is the sum of platinum, palladium and gold grades in grammes per tonne.
4 Unki Ore Reserves: A revision of the stope width resulted in a grade decrease and tonnage increase.
The new mine plan converts only the first five years into Proved Ore Reserves.
5 Unki Mineral Resources: A revised resource cut resulted in a grade decrease and tonnage increase.
The 2005 model covers a different area than previously reported.
6 Anooraq Anglo Platinum JV: Following the finalisation of an agreement, Anglo Platinum holds an attributable interest of 50%.
7 Shebas Ridge: Following the finalisation of an agreement, Anglo Platinum holds an attributable interest of 35%.
The revised modelling with external reviews by SRK and Snowden resulted in Mineral Resource classification upgrades.
In 2005, a cut-off of US$10.5 per tonne total revenue from the constituent metals was applied.
In 2004, erroneously reported 2.1 Moz contained ounces in the Inferred category.
8 River Valley: Anglo Platinum holds an attributable interest of 50%.
9 Pedra Branca: Anglo Platinum holds an attributable interest of 50%.
In 2005, a cut-off 3E PGE grade of 0.7g t was applied.
The Mineral Resources were not reported in 2004.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2005 | 93 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources estimates continued stated as at 31 December 2005 Gold In determining the economic parameters to be used, AngloGold Ashanti has been guided by the preferred position of the SEC in the USA, whereby the economic parameters used are based on a three year historical average.
The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as a minimum standard.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves attributable to AngloGold Ashanti.
Anglo American plcs interest in AngloGold Ashanti is 50.88%.
1 AngloGold Ashanti report Mineral Resources as inclusive of those Mineral Resources modified to produce the Ore Reserve' JORC, i. e. the Ore Reserves are included in the Mineral Resource figures.
2 Imperial units: tonnage is reported in million short tons Mton, grade in troy ounces per short ton oz t and contained metal in million troy ounces Moz.
3 Reductions in Ore Reserve caused by economics: Moab Khotsong 4.1 Moz, Mponeng 1.3 Moz and Tau Lekoa 1.6 Moz.
4 The Obuasi 2005 Ore Reserve, which is a major component of the Ghana total, is based on a Mineral Resource model estimated in early 2005, using the techniques against which the conversion factors between Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve have historically been determined.
The Obuasi 2005 Mineral Resource was estimated during the fourth quarter of 2005, using improved techniques.
Consequently, the Modifying Factors between this in situ Mineral Resource and the ore delivered to the mill have as yet not been quantified and are being determined by ongoing reconciliation.
5 Scoping studies including capital requirements and current costs showed that a significant amount of material previously included in Mineral Resource no longer showed reasonable economic potential.
Consequently this material has been excluded from the current Mineral Resource statement.
In accordance with its external Audit policy it is AngloGold Ashanti's intention to audit the 2005 Mineral Resource and Ore Reserves for the following operations: Moab Khotsong, Tau Lekoa, VRGO, Navachab, Siguiri and Serra Grande.

Other Coal Resources refers to coal resources in Project areas not included in the Additional Coal Resources of Metallurgical, Thermal, Power Generation or Synfuels Collieries.
1 Coal Reserves are quoted on a Run of Mine ROM reserve tonnage basis, which represent the tonnes delivered to the plant, and on a saleable reserve tonnage basis, which represent the product tonnes produced.
2 Reported % and Attributable % refers to 2005 only.
For the 2004 Reported and Attributable figures, please refer to the previous annual report.
3 Includes 100% of Coal Reserves and Coal Resources of consolidated entities and the Group's share of joint ventures and associates where applicable.
Where the Group's share is more than 50%, then 100% of the reserves and resources are reported.
The tonnage is quoted as metric tonnes and abbreviated as Mt for million tonnes.
4 Yield % represents the ratio of saleable reserve tonnes to ROM reserve tonnes and is quoted on a constant moisture basis or on an air dried to air dried basis.
5 The coal quality for the Coal Reserves is quoted as a weighted average of the heat content of all saleable coal products.
The coal quality for the Coal Resources are reported on an in situ heat content basis.

7 Coal Resources are quoted on a mineable tonnage in situ MTIS basis in addition to those resources which have been modified to produce the reported Coal Reserves.
Coal quality is quoted on a MTIS basis.
8 Inferred in the Mine Plan refers to Coal Resources that are included in the life of mine schedule of the respective Collieries but which are not reported as Coal Reserves.
This represents a change in the reporting from 2004.
98 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2005 Material changes to Run of Mine ROM Coal Reserves from 2004 to 2005: Export Metallurgical Australia: The increase in reserves from 491 Mt to 633 Mt is attributed mainly to the inclusion of additional resources into German Creek Colliery 60 Mt and the approval of the Lake Lindsay Project 98 Mt.
Export Thermal Australia: The increase in reserves from 199 Mt to 222 Mt is due mainly to an increase in reserves at Drayton Colliery 32 Mt following the optimisation of the mine layout.
Export Thermal Colombia: The increase in reserves from 266 Mt to 314 Mt is mainly as a result of the approval to expand production and the commensurate change in the mine plan 38 Mt.
Export Thermal South Africa: The decrease in reserves from 543 Mt to 450 Mt is attributed mainly to the downgrading of certain reserves to inferred resources in the mine plan as a result of insufficient borehole washability coal quality data at Greenside Colliery -56 Mt and depletion by mining in 2005 -30 Mt.
Domestic Power Generation South Africa: The decrease in reserves from 866 Mt to 824 Mt is primarily due to depletion by mining in 2005 -36 Mt and due to a transfer of probable reserves to inferred resources within the mine plan at New Denmark Colliery -34 Mt that is offset by an increase of reserves at Kriel Colliery 38 Mt brought about by a transfer of additional resources to reserves.
Material changes to Additional Coal Resources from 2004 to 2005: Inferred Coal Resources included in mine plans are defined and reported separately in 2005 as Additional Coal Resources for all operations, and not included in the reserve tabulations, have resulted in a gain of additional resources 192 Mt.
Export Metallurgical Australia: The increase in resources from 267Mt to 395 Mt is attributed mainly to the transfer of resources within the mine plan to Additional Coal Resources 68 Mt and the inclusion of inferred resources within the mine plan 7 Mt at German Creek Colliery.
An increase of 17 Mt at Dawson Central and North Collieries is due mainly to the inclusion of inferred resources in the mine plan 40 Mt offset by losses -21 Mt as a result of igneous sills and seam washouts identified by exploration drilling.
Lake Lindsay Other Coal Resources are transferred to Additional Coal Resources 30 Mt.
Export Thermal Colombia: The increase in additional resources from 275 Mt to 349 Mt is as a result of a change brought about by the revised mine plan associated with the approved production increase.
Export Thermal South Africa: The increase from 555 Mt to 579 Mt is brought about by the transfer of reserves to inferred resources in the mine plan at Greenside Colliery 85 Mt offset by a decrease at Goedehoop Colliery -64 Mt resulting from the redefinition of selective mining horizons in the Elders Project area.
Export Thermal Venezuela: The increase in attributable additional resources from 10 Mt to 33 Mt is as a result of the discovery of additional resources during exploration drilling.
Domestic Power Generation Australia: The decrease in resources from 640 Mt to 608 Mt is due mainly to the change in economic assumptions at Callide Colliery -57 Mt.
Domestic Power Generation South Africa: The increase in resources from 91 Mt to 268 Mt is due primarily to the inclusion of inferred resources in the mine plan at New Denmark Colliery 46 Mt and the inclusion of Maccauvlei West Project into additional resources at New Vaal Colliery due to additional exploration drilling 107 Mt.
Material changes to Other Coal Resources from 2004 to 2005: Australia: The decrease in Other Coal Resources from 830 Mt to 760 Mt is due to the transfer of Lake Lindsay Project other coal resources to reserves and additional resources -121 Mt, offset by the transfer of inferred resources to measured resources at Saddlers Creek 57 Mt.
South Africa: The decrease in Other Coal Resources from 3,280 Mt to 2,455 Mt is attributed to: Elders: 177 Mt due to a change in economic assumptions.
Arnot North Mafube Macro Project: -212 Mt made up of -93 Mt sold, -86 Mt transferred to inferred resources and relinquishing -35 Mt due to the MPRDA.
Zondagsfontein: -278 Mt due to transfer to inferred resources as a result of an improved definition of resources following a feasibility study.
Coalbrook: a reduction in Other Coal Resources due to relinquishment of the coal resources -520 Mt in response to the limitations of the 8 year time frame for development imposed by the MPRDA.
New Largo: the sale of coal to Ingwe -51 Mt offset by a change in economic assumptions 38 Mt.
Other Resources Monash Energy is investigating the production of liquid fuels from brown coal in the Latrobe Valley, Victoria, Australia.
The coal resource and reserve statement will be finalised on completion of a feasibility study.
Brown coal resources are estimated at approximately 6,000 Mt at 62% moisture content.
Impact of the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act MPRDA on the reporting of Coal Resources and Coal Reserves in South Africa In preparing the 2005 Coal Reserve and Coal Resource statement, Anglo Coal has adopted the following policy in respect of mineral rights: Mining Rights: Where applications for Mining Rights have been submitted and these are still being processed, these have been included in the statement.
Where applications for Mining Rights have not yet been submitted these have also been included in the statement.
The deadline for submission is April 2009.
Prospecting Rights: Where applications for new Prospecting Rights have been initially refused and are still the subject of ongoing review and discussions with the relevant authorities, but Anglo Coal has a reasonable expectation that the rights will be granted in due course, the relevant resources have been included in the statement.
These relevant resources exclude coal resources associated with certain Prospecting Rights that Anglo Coal intends to transfer to Black Economic Empowerment Junior Miner companies as part of Anglo Coal South Africas continued strategy of empowerment.
As at 31 December 2005, 1,675 Mt of the reported Other Coal Resources and 91 Mt of reported Additional Coal Resources were subject to applications for new Prospecting Rights, of which applications in respect of 1,463 Mt have initially been refused and are the subject of ongoing review and discussions with the relevant authorities.
Consistent with the principles adopted in the reporting of mineral resources in South Africa previously described in the introduction, Anglo Coal currently expects that the outcome of such review and discussions will be favourable.
Audits were carried out in 2005 on the following operations and project areas: South Africa: New Vaal Mac West Project and Mafube expansion Project.
Australia: Lake Lindsay Project, Moranbah North, Dartbrook and Drayton.

The figures reported represent 100% of the Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources, the percentage attributable to Anglo American plc is stated separately.
Mining method: UG Underground, OP Open Pit.
TCu total copper, ICu insoluble copper total copper less acid soluble copper, ASCu acid soluble copper.
1 Los Bronces Sulphide Flotation : Reserve metal gains result from conversion of resources to reserves based on new drilling information.
2 Mantos Blancos Sulphide Flotation : Reserve metal loss due to transfer to vat leach process.
3 Mantoverde Oxide Heap Leach : Ore loss due mainly to change in pit design in order to optimise waste stripping.
4 Mantoverde Oxide Dump Leach : Metal gain results from relatively high carbonate-content material, previously considered waste, now being amenable for the dump leach process.
5 Collahuasi: In the 2004 Annual Report, only the attributable tonnage was stated.
6 Collahuasi Sulphide Flotation : Metal decrease due to mining depletion and transfer of ore to low grade sulphide.
7 Los Bronces Sulphide Flotation : Measured and Indicated Resources have decreased due to conversion to reserves as well as a change in the classification methodology, inherited from the previous owner.
The significant movements of material to Inferred resources which are not reported, are expected to be reversed with the current and future in-fill drilling programs.
Furthermore, although not reported, the total Inferred Resources have increased due to new information from the recent drilling campaign.
The Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources of the following operations were audited during 2005 by third party, independent auditors: El Soldado and Mantoverde.

102 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2005 Base Metals continued For the polymetallic deposits, the tonnage figures apply to each metal.
1 Black Mountain Broken Hill Deeps : In 2004 Broken Hill and the Deeps orebodies were reported combined.
With the shift in mining operations to the Deeps orebody, the Broken Hill Ore Reserves have been closed off and re-allocated to Mineral Resources.
Ore Reserves contain 12.8 Mt of silver ore at 54 g t as a by-product.
2 Black Mountain Swartberg : Changes to the method for calculating the economic cut-off has led to a decrease in the Swartberg Ore Reserve.
Ore Reserves contain 0.3 Mt of silver ore at 81g t as a by-product.
3 Lisheen: Improved grades from drilling in the Bog Zone satellite orebody resulted in a net metal increase in the Ore Reserve.
4 Skorpion: New information from infill drilling has resulted in a decrease in reserve tonnes but an increase in grade.
Net effect is an overall decrease in contained zinc metal.

1 The decrease in Mamatwan Ore Reserves is due to the introduction of a boundary pillar as a result of a change in the mining plan.
Mamatwan tonnages stated as Wet Metric Tonnes, while Wessels is Dry Metric Tonnes.
In the 2004 Annual Report, only the attributable tonnage was stated.
2 The Ore Reserves reported are stated with total tonnage but report the grade values only above the nominated cut-off of 40% Mn product grade.
The grade is reported using beneficiated grades, as beneficiated grades are used in mine scheduling, quality control and blending rather than in situ grades.
3 The Ore Reserve grades and tonnages are reported after crushing, washing and screening.
4 Hotazel Manganese Mines report Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources as inclusive of those Mineral Resources modified to produce the Ore Reserve JORC, Mamatwan tonnages stated as Wet Metric Tonnes, while Wessels is Dry Metric Tonnes.

1 Sishen Iron Ore Mine: Ore Reserve tonnage increased significantly due to the inclusion of the jig plant ore. An estimated 500 Mt of the total Mineral Resource is banded iron formation BIF material of which around 55% can be blended into the jig plant feed, the remainder will be stockpiled.
All stockpiled BIF at the end of the mines life is excluded from the reported Ore Reserves.
The 2005 Total Saleable Product tonnes comprise the following: 600 Mt at 65.7% Fe from the DMS plant and 243 Mt at 64.0% Fe from the jig plant.
2 Thabazimbi Iron Ore Mine: Mining depletion of 3 Mt accounts for most of the decrease in Ore Reserves.
2.95 Mt Inferred Mineral Resources are included in the pit shells, these are not included in the Ore Reserve figures reported.
3 Sishen South Iron Ore Project: Not reported in 2004.
Estimates are for a 9 Mt per annum open pit operation.
4 Grootegeluk Coal Mine: Re-configuration of the beneficiation capabilities to create a higher-value product resulted in an increase in the Saleable Coking Coal of 8 Mt and a decrease in the Saleable Thermal Coal of 20 Mt.
5 Leeuwpan Coal Mine: The Reserve estimate includes 53.4 Mt Proved and 16.2 Mt Probable Coal Reserves that occur in an area where Prospecting Rights are under appeal.
These Coal Reserves are quoted pending the outcome of the appeal SAMREC 5.5.
The decrease in the Coal Resource see footnote 18 resulted in a concomitant decrease in Coal Reserve.
6 Tshikondeni Coal Mine: Coal Reserves formerly reported for an area not included in the Mine Lease Area have been excluded 0.2 Mt from the 2005 estimate.
7 Inyanda Coal Advanced Project : In 2004 reported the attributable %.
8 Rosh Pinah: Mining depletion 0.6 Mt and the addition of Ore Reserves from the conversion of Mineral Resources delineated during the intensive exploration programme in 2005 explain the increase in Ore Reserves.
9 Glen Douglas Dolomite Mine: The deepening and subsequent redesign of the pit resulted in the increases of 7.7 Mt metallurgical and 1.2 Mt aggregate dolomite.
10 Bridgetown Dolomite Mine: The Ore Reserve was depleted by mining activities 0.3Mt, however, changes in saleable tonnes are due to an increase in fines production at the plant.
11 Hillendale Mine: The decrease in Ore Reserves is due to mining depletion 8.3 Mt and a change to the mining boundary in relation to the mining fence 2.2 Mt.
Leucoxene was not reported in 2004.
is included as an Ore Reserve in 2005 pending the approval of the Mining Right.
As the Mining Right for Fairbreeze C Ext.
has not yet been granted the Measured Mineral Resources have been converted to Probable Ore Reserves SAMREC 5.1.
Ore Reserves were estimated using a cut-off of 3% Ilm, not 1.5% Ilm used for Fairbreeze C. All valuable heavy minerals for Fairbreeze C and C Ext.
and ilmenite for Fairbreeze A and B can be estimated with the highest confidence Proved.
Fairbreeze A and B zircon, rutile and leucoxene are estimated with lower confidence Probable.
Therefore, the Proved and Probable grades for zircon, rutile and leucoxene relate to 17 Mt and 164 Mt respectively.
13 Jurien: Proved Ore Reserves have been downgraded to Probable Ore Reserves with the updating of geological models and Mineral Resources estimates.
14 Dongara: Reported as Magnetic Minerals, Ticor in 2004.
Proved Ore Reserves have been downgraded to Probable Ore Reserves with the updating of the geological models and Mineral Resource estimates.

114 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2005 15 Sishen Iron Ore Mine: The significant increase is due to the inclusion of jig plant ore whereby lower Fe-grade rocks can be beneficiated to a saleable product using jig technology.
Additional resources with a grade 60% Fe that have underground mining potential outside the optimised pit, are reported separately in 2005.
16 Thabazimbi Iron Ore Mine: Allocation of 37.6 Mt from 2004 Mineral Resources to mineral inventory partly explains the decrease in 2005.
17 Sishen South: 133 Mt were allocated to mineral inventory.
Remaining Inferred Resources are material to the Project and are 42 Mt at 62 %Fe 18 Leeuwpan Coal Mine: Additional drilling led to an updated geological model and resulted in a decrease of Coal Resources 18 Mt.
See note 5 for comment on Prospecting Right.
19 Tshikondeni Coal Mine: The Coal Resources formerly reported in an area not included in Mine Lease Area, have been excluded in the 2005 estimate 0.3 Mt.
