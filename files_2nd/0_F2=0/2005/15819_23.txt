These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tomkins plc as of December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005, January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 4 to the financial statements, in fiscal 2005 the Company 1 changed the presentation of its consolidated statements of cash flows to include the cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities of discontinued operations within the respective categories of operating, investing, and financing activities of the Company, and 2 separately restated the presentation within its statement of changes in shareholders equity.
Fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 have been retroactively restated to reflect these changes.
As discussed in Note 18 to the financial statements, the Company early adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
