A loan from a subsidiary, previously held as a current liability under UK GAAP, has been reclassified as a non-current liability under IFRS to more accurately reflect the terms of the loan.
Given that the company has elected to retain UK GAAP carrying values of property, plant and equipment including any historic revaluations as deemed cost on the date of transition to IFRS there is no difference between cost and valuation on an IFRS basis.
Accordingly, the UK GAAP revaluation reserve has been transferred from other reserves to retained earnings.
Treasury shares formed part of retained earnings under UK GAAP.
Under IFRS, these amounts have been recategorised as part of other reserves.
33 b Dividends received Under UK GAAP final dividends proposed by subsidiaries were accrued as income immediately in the financial statements of Provident Financial plc.
Under IFRS, dividends receivable from subsidiaries can only be recognised when they have been paid.
The adjustment in the reconciliations above therefore represents the reversal of accrued income in respect of dividends receivable from subsidiaries.
33 c Retirement benefits The adjustments reflect the write off of the companys SSAP 24 prepayment and the recognition of the companys share of the group IAS 19 pension deficit on the balance sheet.
See note 32 d for further information.
33 d Share-based payments The adjustments reflect the companys share of the group share-based payments charge.
See note 32 e for further information.
33 e Derivatives The adjustments represent the recognition of the companys derivative financial instruments at fair value.
See note 32 f for further information.
33 f Dividends paid The adjustments represent the reversal of the companys proposed year end dividend.
See note 32 g for further information.
