The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2005 45 Note 2 Additional consolidated income statement Additional income statement information is provided as a useful guide to underlying trading performance.
The adjustments from the statutory income statement are to aid understanding of the income statement and should be read in conjunction with, rather than as a substitute for, the reported information.
DPP Restaurants Limited DPP has been consolidated as a subsidiary under IAS 27 throughout the year even though The Restaurant Group plc TRG or the Group legally only held 19.9% of the issued share capital as detailed further in note 11.
As TRG has subsequent to the year end acquired full control of DPP, the trading performance of DPP has been shown separately due to the different shape that this division will have going forward.
Non-trading items include redundancy and restructuring costs incurred following the acquisition of Blubeckers Limited and redundancy costs incurred in DPP Restaurants Limited, profits and losses made on disposal of businesses and property, plant and equipment, and finance charges arising on the remeasurement of swap instruments.

The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2005 53 11 Post balance sheet events a DPP Restaurants Limited On 17 November 2004, The Restaurant Group plc the Group or TRG announced that it had been granted an option to take full control of DPP Restaurants Limited DPP, operators of the Deep Pan Pizza chain of restaurants.
This option became exercisable on 31 December 2004, and, under IFRS, the Group was required to consolidate 100% of DPP, even though the option had not been exercised.
Consequently the Groups results for 2005 have included 100% of the losses made by DPP, although legally TRG only owned 19.9% of DPP.
On 12 January 2006, the Group announced that it had acquired full control of DPP for a nominal sum.
TRG originally sold 52 branches to DPP Restaurants Limited in 2001.
Subsequently DPP has disposed of 19 units eight of which have been to TRG.
Those units which have been converted into TRG brands have shown an average sales increase of over 100%.
b Return of value and share consolidation Following the disposal of Caffe Uno to Craftbutton Limited in December 2005 see note 15 for further details the Group announced that it would make a return of value to shareholders.
On 7 February 2006 the Group announced a special dividend of 16p per share totalling 34.8m which was paid to shareholders on 9 March 2006.
At an Extraordinary General Meeting on 23 February 2006, shareholders granted approval for a share consolidation whereby nine existing ordinary shares were exchanged for eight new ordinary shares.

Interest is accruing on the outstanding balance of 10.375 million disclosed as a non-current receivable at LIBOR.
A profit of 1.6m was made on disposal.
The disposal of shares in Est Est Est Restaurants Limited qualifies for substantial shareholding exemption, and consequently no tax charge has been recognised in respect of that profit.
The analysis of assets and liabilities sold and consideration received is detailed below: 000 Property, plant and equipment 14,492 Stock 157 Trade and other receivables 287 Cash and cash equivalents 11 Trade and other payables 283 Deferred tax 1,719 Net assets 12,945 Gross profit arising on disposal 3,137 16,082 40% of profit not recognised following investment in Living Ventures Limited 1,255 Provision against warranty claims 300 Net profit arising on disposal 1,582 Sale proceeds Cash consideration received 6,000 Deferred consideration 10,375 Professional fees 293 16,082 13 Acquisition of 40% stake in Living Ventures Limited The Group has recognised a profit of 1.6m following the disposal of Est Est Est Restaurants Limited to Living Ventures Limited on 31 March 2005.

This unrecognised profit was 1,255,000 as disclosed in note 12.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2005 54 Notes to the accounts continued 14 Acquisition of Blubeckers Limited On 21 June 2005 The Restaurant Group plc completed the acquisition of 100% of the ordinary share capital of Blubeckers Limited for 22.75m, and a further payment of 4.3 million for the repayment of intercompany debt.
Blubeckers Limited operates two restaurant brands, Blubeckers and Edwinns, and at the date of acquisition had 17 restaurants in the south of England.
In the six months that Blubeckers was a subsidiary of the Group it contributed 1.3m to net profit.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2005, Group revenue including DPP Restaurants Limited would have been 310.8m and profit before tax including DPP Restaurants Limited would have been 32.5m.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities: Recognised Fair value Carrying values adjustments amounts 000 000 000 Property, plant and equipment 19,884 36 19,848 Stocks 287 115 172 Trade and other receivables 200 123 77 Cash and cash equivalents 938 938 Trade and other payables 1,816 71 1,887 Deferred tax 226 2,370 2,596 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 19,267 2,715 16,552 Goodwill on acquisition 11,275 Consideration paid, satisfied in cash 27,827 Cash acquired 938 Net cash outflow 26,889 Following the acquisition there has been a programme of integrating operational and support functions into The Restaurant Group plc.
As a result of this, costs of 221,000 have been incurred.
These costs are considered as non-trading as they relate to the integration.
15 Disposal of Caffe Uno On 12 December 2005 the Group completed the disposal of 53 of the 59 sites that formed the Caffe Uno brand.
The associated business assets were sold to Craftbutton Limited for 33.025m, which was received in cash, less associated expenses including expenses pertaining to the return of value to shareholders.
The remaining sites will be sold or rebranded, and accordingly have been written down to their estimated realisable value.
The disposal was completed as an asset transaction and consequently there is a taxation charge arising on the profit on disposal.
A working capital adjustment has been made subsequent to the year end whereby Craftbutton Limited has paid the book value of identifiable working capital balances.

As such, it is not amortised but is subject to an annual impairment review.
This impairment review is based on a value in use calculation, whereby the discounted cash flow projections of the business are reviewed against the carrying value of the goodwill.
Cash flow projections are based on budgeted information as approved by the Board and with reference to the Groups three year business plan, with discount rates of 8% applied.
A growth rate beyond the forecast cycle of 2.5% has been applied.

Under these schemes the Remuneration Committee may grant options over shares in The Restaurant Group plc to employees of the Group.
The contractual life of an option is ten years.
Awards under the ESOPs are generally reserved for senior management level and above and 53 employees were eligible to participate at 1 January 2006.
Options granted under the ESOPs become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to growth in earnings per share exceeding RPI growth by more than 4% under the 1998 scheme 1 or 2 2% under the 2003 scheme.

Options were valued using the Stochastic option pricing model.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
As permitted by IFRS 2, only options granted since 7 November 2002 which were unvested at 1 January 2005 have been valued.
A reconciliation of the movement in outstanding share options under the ESOPs is provided below: At 1 January 2006 At 31 December 2004 Weighted Weighted average average exercise exercise Number price Number price Outstanding at the start of the year 5,304,658 77.5p 6,941,483 60.9p Granted 1,629,000 134.4p 1,975,000 97.7p Exercised 715,863 59.1p 1,172,186 53.5p Lapsed 512,531 91.1p 2,439,639 58.2p Outstanding at the end of the year 5,705,264 94.8p 5,304,658 77.5p Exercisable at the end of the year 169,439 65.8p 377,837 60.7p During 2003 the Group adopted the 2003 Executive Share Option Mirror Scheme.
The 2003 Mirror Scheme was introduced on similar terms to the 1998 Scheme save for certain changes which are incorporated into the 2003 Mirror Scheme.

The loan note is secured on the assets of Est Est Est Restaurants Limited but is subject to a prior ranking behind Living Ventures Limiteds bank.
Other details regarding interest and maturity are provided in note 18.
Financial liabilities The financial liabilities of the Group comprised: 2005 2004 000 000 Short-term borrowings at floating interest rates 1,845 5,134 Income tax liabilities 8,315 5,531 Trade and other payables 71,476 57,773 Short-term financial liabilities 81,636 68,438 Long-term borrowings at floating interest rates 11,000 7,000 Finance lease debt 2,696 4,431 Provisions 763 625 Long-term financial liabilities 14,459 12,056 Financial liabilities 96,095 80,494 Total financial liabilities attracting interest were 12,845,000 2004: 12,134,000.
Interest is payable at floating interest rates which fluctuate and are dependent on LIBOR or base rate.
The average weighted year end interest rate for these borrowings was 5.50% 2004: 5.60%.
Effective from 16 January 2003, the Group entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of 20,000,000 to be fixed at 4.55% per annum for a period of three years, terminating on 15 January 2006.
The Group also entered into an interest rate swap for a further notional amount of 20,000,000 to be fixed at 4.395% per annum for a period of three years, effective from 16 January 2003 which terminated on 15 January 2006.
This second interest rate swap provided the counterparty with the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a further transaction to renew the interest rate swap of 20,000,000 at 4.395% for a further two years, terminating on 15 January 2008.
This option was not taken up by the counterparty.
Effective from 16 January 2006, the Group entered into a new interest rate swap for an initial notional amount of 20,000,000, rising to 50,000,000 from 18 April 2006 until 16 January 2008, when it reduces to 30,000,000 until 16 January 2009, when it terminates.
The fixed rate for the duration of the three years is 4.695%.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2005 64 Notes to the accounts continued 29 Financial instruments and derivatives continued The Group has 69,000,000 2004: 63,000,000 of committed borrowing facilities in excess of gross borrowings at 1 January 2006 which are due to expire in 2008.
During the year the Group extended its principal banking facility from 70 million to 80 million.
In addition, the Group excluding DPP Restaurants Limited had a further 8,155,000 2004: 5,224,000 available with its overdraft facility which is renewable annually.
DPP Restaurants Limited had an overdraft facility of 625,000 as at 1 January 2006 2004: 800,000, of which nil was utilised at 1 January 2006 31 December 2004: 358,000. b Foreign currency exposure profile as at 1 January 2006 The Group has invested in and operates three restaurants in Spain, where the currency is the Euro.
Consequently the Group has a potential currency exposure on the translation of results from its Spanish operations, and translating the assets and liabilities from Euros to the Groups reporting currency, Sterling.
This exposure is reviewed on a regular basis, and is not considered to be material to the performance of the Group, or to the balance sheet.
c Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 2005 2005 2004 2004 000 000 000 000 Primary financial instruments held or used to finance the Groups operations: Cash and deposits 426 426 482 482 Overdraft loan maturing within one year 1,845 1,845 5,134 5,134 Borrowings maturing after one year 11,000 11,000 7,000 7,000 12,419 12,419 11,652 11,652 The Group does not hold any financial instruments for trading purposes.
The fair value of short term borrowings and cash at bank and in hand together with short-term non-interest bearing trade and other receivables and trade and other payables approximate to book values due to the short term maturity of these instruments.
As highlighted in note 18, book value approximates to fair value in respect of the non-current receivable of 10,375,000.
The Group has derivative instruments relating to interest rate swaps.
In accordance with IAS 39 this has been valued at 1 January 2006.
The fair value of this instrument was 7,000 2004: 127,000 and this is accounted for in the consolidated balance sheet.
Movements on the fair value are recorded through the consolidated income statement.
In accordance with the transitional provisions available under IFRS 1, the Group did not adopt IAS 39 until periods commencing after 1 January 2005.
Consequently, opening reserves were adjusted by the fair value of the interest rate swap on 1 January 2005 and net assets of the Group increased by 127,000, with an equivalent increase in equity.
As IAS 32 and IAS 39 have not been applied until periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005, comparative information for the period ending 31 December 2004 is based on UK GAAP.
d Credit risk The Group has credit risks on its trade debtors and the long-term receivable from Living Ventures Limited.
Due to the nature of the Groups business there are not significant exposures on underlying revenue trading.
Counterparties for cash and derivative balances are with financial institutions with strong credit ratings.

There are no restrictions imposed by the Groups operating leases, either in the current or prior year.
Included within the minimum rentals are amounts payable as concession fees.
These arrangements are principally in the Groups Concessions division, which operates on UK airports.
Within these concession arrangements there is usually a concession fee for each unit which is based on the revenue derived from that unit.
In addition, the Group has a current commitment to minimum rent payments of 58,631,000 in respect of Caffe Uno sites which are being assigned or sublet to Craftbutton Limited following the disposal of the Caffe Uno business on 12 December 2005.
Under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement with Craftbutton Limited, the purchaser has the economic liability of the lease, although the Group will remain the head lessee until such time that the leases are assigned.
The comparative 2004 information reflects the consolidation of DPP Restaurants Limited under IFRS.

33 First time adoption of IFRS The Group reported under UK GAAP in its previous published financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The analysis below shows a reconciliation of profit and net assets as reported under UK GAAP at 31 December 2004 to the revised net profit and net assets under IFRS reported in these financial statements.
In addition, there is a reconciliation of profit under pro forma UK GAAP to the profit reported under IFRS in these financial statements, to highlight the impact of the adjustments.
It should be noted that the proforma UK GAAP numbers for 2005 are based on accounting policies that had been adopted at 31 December 2004 and do not take into account changes in UK GAAP which took effect from 1 January 2005.
The rules for first time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS 1, First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
IFRS 1 states that a company should use the same accounting policies in its opening balance sheet and throughout periods presented in its first IFRS financial statements.
The opening balance sheet date 1 January 2004 is reconciled from UK GAAP to IFRS below.
The standard requires these accounting policies to comply with IFRSs effective at the reporting date of the first published financial statements under IFRS, which is 1 January 2006.
IFRS 1 allows exemptions from the application of certain IFRSs to assist companies in the transition process.
TRG has taken advantage of the exemption of adopting IAS 32, Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation and IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement from 1 January 2005 with no restatement of comparative information in the financial statements.
TRG has also applied IFRS 2, Share-based payment to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.

This expense, which is primarily in relation to employee option and performance share schemes, is recognised over the vesting period of the scheme.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption available under IFRS 2 which allows the measurement of this expense to be calculated only on options granted after 7 November 2002.
The Group has principally adopted the Stochastic model for the purposes of computing fair value under IFRS.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2005 69 33 First time adoption of IFRS continued b IAS 17, Leases requires that the land element of leases on land and buildings is considered separately for the purposes of determining whether the lease is a finance or operating lease.
A majority of the Groups buildings are on leases of 25 years or less which may be classified as operating leases under IFRS.
This treatment is consistent with UK GAAP.
There are a small number of leases greater than 25 years and where there is an element of financing built into the rental payment cycle, where the buildings element of the leases have been reclassified as finance leases based on the criteria set out in IAS 17.
As a result, the Groups IFRS balance sheet includes additional tangible fixed assets and additional finance lease obligations.
The main impact on the income statement is that the operating lease payment charged to operating profit under UK GAAP is replaced with a depreciation charge of the asset in operating profit and a financing charge interest expense.
Whilst the total charge for a lease over the life of the lease will be the same under UK GAAP and IFRS, the profile of the charge is different, with the charge being more front loaded under IFRS.
c In December 2001 TRG disposed of the Deep Pan Pizza business for a consideration of 3.3 million of which 1 million was paid on completion with the balance to be paid on a deferred basis.
Since then, a further 1.8 million has been received, leaving an outstanding balance of 0.5 million.
The business was sold to a new company, DPP Restaurants Limited DPP, which has traded as Deep Pan Pizza.
DPP faced a challenging trading environment during the latter part of 2004 and sought to counter this through a programme of estate rationalisation, and in so far as its financial resources have permitted, by investing in and refreshing some restaurants.
On 17 November 2004 TRG announced that it had deferred settlement of the outstanding consideration due from DPP and had taken a warrant incorporating an option exercisable in certain specified circumstances to convert its outstanding 0.5 million deferred consideration balance into new DPP ordinary shares at par.
The option became exercisable on 31 December 2004 but TRG chose not to convert the warrant during the financial year ended 1 January 2006.
As the option became exercisable on 31 December 2004, under IFRS the balance sheet for DPP is required to be consolidated although TRG did not have control of that company.
Under IAS 27, the Group was required to consolidate the results and balance sheet of DPP, regardless of whether the option has been exercised or not.
Under IFRS, there is a requirement that if a company can exercise theoretical control over another entity through an option, it should consolidate the entity concerned.
IAS 27 specifically notes that the intentions of management and the financial ability to exercise control are not considered in assessing whether potential voting rights constitute control.
Following the consolidation of DPP, goodwill of 0.8 million was written off through the income statement.
This was a one-off charge, recognised at the theoretical time of acquisition under IFRS.
d Under IFRS, a deferred tax liability in respect of capital gains that have been rolled over into replacement assets was accounted for.
Under UK GAAP it was not necessary to provide for this.
During 2005 113,000 of this was unwound.
Deferred tax is also realised in the balance sheet for other IFRS adjustments.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2005 70 Notes to the accounts continued 33 First time adoption of IFRS continued e IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement address the accounting for, and reporting of, financial instruments.
IAS 39 sets out detailed accounting requirements in relation to financial assets and liabilities.
All derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair market value whilst other financial instruments are accounted for either at amortised cost or at fair value depending on their classification.
The Group took advantage of transition rules to defer the transition to IFRS for the implementation of IAS 32 and IAS 39 to 1 January 2005.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps held by the Group as detailed in note 29 is required to be recognised on the balance sheet.
Movements in the fair value of the swaps is recognised in the income statement.
In accordance with the transitional arrangements under IFRS, the opening balance sheet for 2005 included the market value of the swaps, which resulted in an asset of 127,000 as at 1 January 2005, with a resultant increase in reserves.
f IAS 10, Events after the Balance Sheet Date requires that dividends declared after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a liability at that balance sheet date as the liability does not represent a present obligation as defined by IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Accordingly dividends provided for at each respective balance sheet date but which had not been approved by shareholders have been reversed.
The comparative numbers are in accordance with those announced to the London Stock Exchange on 27 June 2005 save for certain consolidated entries in respect of DPP Restaurants Limited the company which is required to be consolidated under IAS 27 following the finalisation of that companys financial statements for the period to 31 December 2004.
These entries are, in effect, adjustments on acquisition and the associated goodwill has been written off to reserves in December 2004.
The net reduction in consolidated reserves of the Group at 31 December 2004 as a result of these entries was 256,000.
The treatment is consistent with that adopted for the acquisition of DPP Restaurants Limited as disclosed in the announcement of 27 June 2005 made by The Restaurant Group plc.
Cash flow statement Under IFRS, the cash flow statement contains certain presentational differences to those previously presented under UK GAAP.
The underlying financial information remains on a consistent basis, other than the inclusion in the IFRS cash flow statement of the overdraft held by DPP Restaurants Limited.
In the IFRS cash flow statement, this is reflected as a net cash outflow on acquisition, representing the overdraft facility of DPP Restaurants Limited recognised in the consolidated accounts under IFRS.
This balance was 358,000 at 31 December 2004.
