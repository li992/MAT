In addition the tax rate would be impacted by the extent to which losses are available to offset taxable income.
The group will benefit from recent tax rate reductions in South Africa, Mexico and the Netherlands and proposed reductions, if made, in Germany and India.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates other than in the case of the groups captive insurance company where cumulative deferred tax of 0.8 million 2004 0.4 million has been provided on an accrued dividend.

employees of the company and some of its UK subsidiaries.
Consequently the company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities and so the company accounts for its contributions to the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
The cost of the companys contributions to the scheme amounted to 12.3 million 2004 12.1 million.
The company also operates the UK post-retirement medical benefits scheme note 11c i which includes some of its employees and a few employees of its UK subsidiaries.
The costs of this scheme are borne by the company and so the schemes liabilities are included in the companys balance sheet.

Interest free financial assets are shares held in publicly quoted companies and an investment in Conduit Ventures Fund.
20b Currency exposures After taking into account the effects of forward exchange contracts the group does not have any significant currency exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
Johnson Matthey 70 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2005 20c Maturity of financial liabilities 2005 2004 million million In one year or less, or on demand 230.6 142.2 In more than one year but not more than two years 90.4 66.4 In more than two years but not more than five years 165.7 210.9 In more than five years 163.1 184.9 649.8 604.4 20d Undrawn committed borrowing facilities 2005 2004 million million Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 54.0 25.4 Expiring in more than two years 54.1 34.8 108.1 60.2 20e Market price risk The group monitors its interest rate and currency risks and other market price risks to which it is exposed primarily through a process known as sensitivity analysis.
This involves estimating the effect on profit before tax over various periods of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
Most of the groups borrowings and deposits are at floating rates.
A 1% change in all interest rates would have a 1.1% impact on profit before tax, exceptional items and goodwill amortisation.
This is within the range the board regards as acceptable.
The main impact of movements in exchange rates on the groups results arises on translation of overseas subsidiaries profits into sterling.
The groups largest exposure is to the US dollar since Johnson Mattheys largest single overseas investment is in the US.
A 5 cent 2.7% movement in the average exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling has a 0.8% impact on total operating profit before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation.
The group is also exposed to the euro.
A 5 cent 3.4% movement in the average exchange rate for the euro against sterling has a 0.6% impact on total operating profit before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation.
This exposure is part of the groups economic risk of operating globally which is essential to remain competitive in the markets in which the group operates.

The fair values of the bonds and interest rate swaps are calculated by discounting future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates prevailing at the year end.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts represents the unrealised gain or loss on revaluation of the contracts to year end exchange rates.
The fair value of all other financial instruments is approximately equal to book value due to their size, short term nature or the fact that they bear interest at floating rates.
Annual Report and Accounts 2005 71 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2005 20g Gains and losses on hedges Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
These forward contracts are revalued to the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date and any aggregate unrealised gains and losses arising on revaluation are included in other debtors other creditors.
At maturity, or when the contract ceases to be a hedge, gains and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
Interest rate swaps are occasionally used to hedge the groups exposure to movements in interest rates.
The interest payable or receivable on such swaps is accrued in the same way as interest arising on deposits or borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value prior to maturity.
