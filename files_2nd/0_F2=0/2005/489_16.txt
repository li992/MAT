Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the mid-market rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Other exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments The principal derivative instruments utilised by the Company are interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
These instruments are used for hedging purposes in line with the Company's risk management policy and no trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
Interest differentials are taken to net interest receivable in the profit and loss account, and premiums and fees are amortised at a constant rate over the life of the underlying instrument.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
