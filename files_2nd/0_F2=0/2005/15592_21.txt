At the date of the last actuarial valuation, the market value of the schemes assets was 1,576m and the actuarial value of these assets represented 91% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings and pensions in payment.
The actuarial shortfall of 159m will be met via increased contributions over a period of ten years, being the expected average remaining service lifetime of employed members.
