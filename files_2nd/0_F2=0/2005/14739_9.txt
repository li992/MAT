Scottish and Southern Energy Annual Report 2005 Directors Responsibilities 31 The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the statement of auditors responsibilities included in the Independent Auditors Report on page 39, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and of the auditors in relation to the Accounts.
The Directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss for the financial year.
The Directors are required to use a going concern basis in preparing the Accounts unless this is inappropriate.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the company and which enable them to ensure that the Accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They have a general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the company and the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and the other irregularities.
The Directors consider that, in preparing the Accounts on pages 40 to 61, the company and the Group have used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all accounting standards which they consider to be applicable have been followed.
