The Absa brand has a carrying value of 174m as at 31st December 2005 and is being amortised over a period of ten years.
The discount rate used in the intangible asset valuations for Absa was based on the cost of equity adjusted for risk and ranges from 13.7% to 16.1%.
In the case of brands, the pre-tax royalty rates were estimated to be 1.5% based on similar financial services transactions, information about marketing expenditure on the brands and consideration of the unique factors relating to the brand that third parties would consider.
Cash flows for customer lists were based on historic revenues and customer numbers adjusted for expected attrition and taking account of applicable costs to determine expected margins.
These margins varied, depending on the nature of the customer relationships.
A similar approach was applied to core deposit intangibles with cash flows being calculated by charging an appropriate cost to the identified spread, on a historical margins basis.
In all the calculations, the rate of tax was estimated to be 31.6% of operating profit.
Impairment charges on internally generated and other software reflect impairment of certain capitalised IT assets following a review of the future economic benefits likely to be generated by them.
Barclays had a collaborative arrangement in South Africa with Standard Bank.
Following the Groups acquisition of a majority stake in Absa, Barclaycard 3.5 and Standard Bank agreed terms for Barclaycards exit from the arrangement leading to the impairment of the unamortised portion of the licence.
Impairment charges detailed above have been included within other operating expenses.
