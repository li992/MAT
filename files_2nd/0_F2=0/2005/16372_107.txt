There are, however, a 1 January 2005. number of minor differences under IAS 19 that give rise to small variations in the gures previously reported.
The most significant Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of these changes are the use of the government bond rate as the Under IFRSs, from 1 January 2004 onwards, we no longer apply discount rate for calculating pension liabilities in countries where systematic amortisation to goodwill and intangible assets with an no AA corporate bond rate exists and the required use of bid value indefinite life, but instead review these assets for impairment on at to measure plan assets rather than mid-market value.
The amortisation charge under previous GAAP for all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in 2004 was In addition, deferred tax balances arising in respect of pension assets 1 040 million.
On disposal, goodwill acquired and written off on and liabilities are no longer netted off against those pension balances, acquisition prior to 1 January 1998 are no longer reinstated as part but under IFRSs are classied together with other deferred tax of the profit or loss on disposal.
The deferred tax balance relating to pensions under previous GAAP amounted to assets of 1 445 million and liabilities of 252 We have applied the exemption in IFRS 1 relating to business million as at 1 January 2004 and assets of 1 519 million and combinations and therefore the carrying value under previous liabilities of 208 million as at 31 December 2004.
GAAP as at 31 December 2003 of 13 457 million for goodwill is its deemed cost at the date of transition to IFRSs.
Under IFRSs, the The impact of the change in the remeasurement of plan assets to a deemed cost of indefinite lived intangibles at the date of transition to bid value basis was a decrease of 34 million as at 1 January 2004 IFRSs is the original cost at which these assets were initially recognised and a decrease of 36 million as at 31 December 2004.

The writeliabilities did not change at 1 January 2004 and increased by back of accumulated amortisation on these assets results in a deemed 15 million as at 31 December 2004.

These changes resulted in an additional of 1 million.
impairment charge for SlimFast amounting to 200 million in the year to 31 December 2004.
Deferred tax Under IFRSs deferred tax is recognised in respect of all taxable Software temporary differences arising between the tax base and the Under IFRSs we capitalise the costs of purchased and internally accounting base of balance sheet items.
This means that deferred tax developed software that meet the criteria for capitalisation established is recognised on certain temporary differences that would not have by IAS 38.
This software is amortised over its useful life, typically a given rise to deferred tax under previous GAAP.
The net book value of purchased and internally developed software as at 1 January 2004 and at 31 December The additional deferred tax included in the balance sheet under IFRSs 2004 amounted to 103 million and 166 million respectively: amounted to a net movement excluding reclassications of 1 095 the amortisation charge for the year ended 31 December 2004 million as at 1 January 2004 and 1 068 million as at 31 December amounted to 21 million.
Included in these amounts is a deferred tax liability relating to intangible assets trademarks and unpatented technologies which Development costs were recognised at the time of the Bestfoods acquisition.
As the The IFRS standard on intangible assets, IAS 38, requires development Bestfoods acquisition was a share-based transaction, these intangible costs to be capitalised where certain specic criteria are met.
Costs assets have a zero tax base.
IAS 12 requires that a deferred tax liability may only be capitalised once the ow of economic benets is assured.
amounting to 1 144 million as at 1 January 2004 and 1 071 million For Unilever this is evident only shortly before a product is launched as at 31 December 2004 is recognised in respect of these intangible into the market and the level of costs incurred after these criteria have assets.
Normally, recognition of this deferred tax liability would lead to been met is not significant.

Recognition of this new deferred tax oil palm trees, at fair value less estimated point-of-sale costs.
Any liability under IFRSs therefore resulted in an equivalent reduction in changes in the fair value of such biological assets are recognised in equity at the transition date.
Point-of-sale costs include all costs that would be necessary to sell the assets, excluding costs necessary to get them to market.
The fair value of tea bushes and oil palm trees as at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004 was 29 million and 33 million respectively.
The net effect on the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004 was a credit of 5 million.

Deferred tax balances arising in respect of Derivative financial instruments pension assets and liabilities are no longer netted off against pension We use certain derivative financial instruments for the purposes balances.
This has led to the overall reclassication of deferred tax of hedging foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
IAS 39 requires balances within the balance sheet.

Joint ventures and associates Under IFRSs we continue to account for joint ventures and associates Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale using the equity method.
However, the presentation of the results of We have applied the provisions of IFRS 5 with effect from 1 January joint ventures and associates has changed, as IAS 1 requires that the 2005.

Our share of joint venture turnover in 2004 amounted to 197 million, and operating Other profit from joint ventures amounted to 44 million.
Under IFRSs our turnover excludes the share of turnover of joint ventures.
Foreign currency translation differences Applying the exemption under IFRS 1, we measure and record all Dividends cumulative foreign currency translation differences arising after the Under IFRSs proposed dividends do not meet the denition of a transition date of 1 January 2004.
These differences are classied as liability until such time as they have been approved by shareholders at a separate component of equity.

The proposed final dividends for 2004 amounted to 1 215 million.
As at 1 January 2004 Leasehold land the proposed final dividends for 2003 amounted to 1 120 million.
Under IAS 17 leases relating to land are generally classied as These amounts have been reclassied from current liabilities to operating leases because land has an indefinite economic life.
Leasehold land usually requires a premium to be paid in advance.
Under previous GAAP we capitalised this payment within xed assets Financial instruments including preference shares as property, plant and equipment and depreciated it over the length From 1 January 2005 Unilever has applied IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Under IFRSs this premium is classied as a prepayment restatements were made to the income statement for the year ended within trade and other receivables due after more than one year.
