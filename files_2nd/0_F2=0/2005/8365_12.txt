This was necessitated by lower than expected trading results in the period since acquisition.
The goodwill impairment was based on a calculation of the recoverable amount based on value in use, using projected cash flows for the Fastech CGU discounted by a pre-tax rate of 12%.
The charge of 2.0m represents the shortfall of the recoverable amount to the carrying value.

Description of borrowings In December 2004, the Group refinanced its existing 300m secured facility with a 300m non-secured facility.
The facility was for five years expiring on 15 December 2009, with the option to extend this for a further two years.
The facility was extended by a year in 2005.
The facility comprises three tranches.
Facility A is now a 56m multi-currency term loan with bi-annual amortisations over the remaining four years.
Facility B is a 150m multi-currency revolving credit, available up to 15 December 2010.
Facility C is a 364 day, 80m multi-currency revolving credit facility, with the option to convert this into a one year loan by the end of the 364 day period.
Advances under Facilities A and B bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR as adjusted plus a margin of 0.45%.
The margin over LIBOR is in the range of 0.6% to 0.4% in accordance with a leveraged grid.
Advances under Facility C initially bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR as adjusted plus a margin of 0.35%.
The margin over LIBOR is in the range 0.5% to 0.3% in accordance with a leveraged grid.
At 31 December 2005, the margin was 0.35%.
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities, which mature in 2010 amounted to 95.5m 2004: 135.1m of which 5.8m 2004: 5.0m has been utilised for letters of credit and guarantees.

The outcome of such litigation and the timing of any potential liability cannot be readily foreseen, as it is often subject to legal proceedings.
Based on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Group in the foreseeable future.
The provision for claims of 8.0m 2004: 4.8m represents an estimate of the amounts payable in connection with identified claims from customers, former employees and other plaintiffs and associated legal costs.
The timing of the cash outflow relating to the provisions is uncertain but is likely to be within one year.
Details of contingent liabilities in respect of claims are set out in note 27.

None of the zero coupon redeemable preference shares were allotted at 31 December 2005, or 31 December 2004.
Ordinary shareholders have a right to attend and vote at a general meeting and may receive a dividend, if declared.
Rights are determined by ordinary resolution of the members.
Preference shareholders have the right to a return of capital on winding up but receive no priority over ordinary shareholders with respect to repayment of capital paid up and have no further rights to participate in the profits or assets of the company.
At 31 December 2004, the Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT, held 87,000 ordinary shares of the company at a cost of 0.1m which was included within retained earnings.
In 2005, these shares were utilised on exercise of share options see note 25.
At 31 December 2005, no shares were held by the ESOT.
The ESOT is managed and controlled by an independent offshore trustee.
The total ESOT costs charged to the Group profits for 2005 were 15,000 2004: 15,000 of which 7,000 2004: 6,000 was interest expense.

Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations as well as the translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net investment in these operations.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of the cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.

22 Employee benefits Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
In most locations, these are defined contribution arrangements.
However, there are significant defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom and in Hong Kong.
These two are funded schemes, with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Other funded defined benefit schemes are not considered to be material and are therefore accounted for as if they were defined contribution schemes.
The schemes in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong were closed to new entrants with effect from 1 April 2002 and 1 December 2002, respectively.
In 2005, 45 former Avecia employees had the option to transfer past service pension benefits to the UK scheme following an acquisition which took place on 13 May 2004.
Approximate assets and liabilities in respect of the 34 members who have elected to transfer are included in the IAS 19 figures below.
The Group recognises any actuarial gains and losses, in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.

The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the plans investment portfolio.
Where investments are held in bonds and cash, the expected long-term rate of return is taken to be the yields generally prevailing on such assets at the balance sheet date.
A higher rate of return is expected on equity investments.
This is based on an out-performance assumption over gilt yields.

In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of services received in return for share options granted to employees, is measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
In accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2, the recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to share option grants made prior to 7 November 2002 which had not vested by 1 January 2005.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Black-Scholes formula, a financial model used to calculate the fair value of options.
During the year ended 31 December 2005, the Group recognised an expense of 1.9m 2004: 1.0m in respect of outstanding share awards granted from 7 November 2002 onwards.

Current share options are granted under a service condition and a non-market performance condition.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement for the services received.
There are no market conditions associated with the current share option grants.

Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
a Credit risk Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are with counterparties who have sound credit ratings.
Given their high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
b Interest rate risk Hedging The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that between 30% and 80% of its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is on a fixed rate basis.
Interest rate swaps, denominated in various currencies, have been entered into to achieve an approximate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure within the Groups policy.
The swaps mature over the next two years and have fixed swap rates ranging from 2.9% to 3.6%.
At 31 December 2005, the Group had interest rate swaps with a notional contract amount of 110.4m.
The Group designates interest rate swaps as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of swaps at 31 December 2005, was 1.7m comprising assets of 1.7m and liabilities of nil.
These amounts were recognised as fair value derivatives.
Under the interest rate swap agreements, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets at 31 December 2005, is set out below: Effective At floating Total carrying interest rates interest rates Interest free amount Financial assets m m m Short term deposits and cash : Sterling 4.7% 0.8 0.8 US dollar 3.1% 5.7 3.2 8.9 Chinese renminbi 1.5% 15.7 15.7 Hong Kong dollar 2.2% 3.6 3.6 Euros 2.0% 1.2 4.0 5.2 Other currencies Various 13.1 3.5 16.6 40.1 10.7 50.8 Investment in associates: US dollar 0.7 0.7 Total financial assets 40.1 11.4 51.5 Short term deposits are overnight deposits bearing interest at rates fixed daily in advance.
