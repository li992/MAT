AstraZeneca Annual Report and 100 Form 20-F Information 2005 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 14 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES CONTINUED Foreign currency risk The US dollar is the Groups most significant currency.
As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures are managed against US dollars accordingly.
Approximately 53% of Group external sales in 2005 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a significant proportion of manufacturing and R&D costs were denominated in sterling and Swedish krona.
In addition, surplus cash generated by business units is converted to, and held centrally in US dollars.
As a result, operating profit and total cash flow in US dollars will be affected by movements in exchange rates.
This currency exposure is managed centrally based on forecast cash flows for the major currencies of Swedish krona, sterling, euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen.
The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated significantly by the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar.
During 2005, we hedged extreme movements in exchange rates using currency options.
From 2006 onwards, we will hedge only if there is a significant change or anticipated change in our risk position.
Strict monitoring of currency exposures and correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval.
It is our policy neither to engage in any speculative transactions nor to hedge currency translation exposures arising from the consolidation of nonUS dollar subsidiaries.
Key controls, applied to transactions in derivative financial instruments, are to use only instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue all financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options only to offset previously purchased options.
In addition, the transaction exposures that arise from non-local currency sales and purchases by subsidiaries are, where practicable, fully hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Credit risk Exposure to financial counterparty credit risk is controlled by the treasury team centrally in establishing and monitoring counterparty limits.
Centrally managed funds are invested entirely with counterparties whose credit rating is A or better.
External fund managers who manage $3,444m of the Groups cash are rated AAA by Standard & Poors.
There were no other significant concentrations of credit risk at the balance sheet date.
All financial instruments are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice and are not backed with cash collateral.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments recorded in the balance sheet.
15 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Interest rate risk The interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Group, along with their effective interest rates and periods in which they reprice, as at 31 December 2005 and at 31 December 2004 are set out below.
In the case of non-current financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps which convert the debt to floating rate.
2005 2004 Effective Less than Effective Less than interest rate Total one year interest rate Total one year %$m$m %$m$m Financial liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings Current see below 90 90 see below 142 142 Non-current 4.91% 1,111 1,111 3.32% 1,127 1,127 1,201 1,201 1,269 1,269 Financial assets Fixed deposits 4.46% 1,549 1,549 3.16% 1,065 1,065 Cash and cash equivalents 3.92% 4,979 4,979 2.02% 4,067 4,067 6,528 6,528 5,132 5,132 The current interest bearing loans and borrowings comprise short term bank borrowings and overdrafts, bearing interest at rates set by reference to applicable local rates.
The financial assets principally comprise cash on overnight deposit or held directly with third party fund managers and short term investments with an average maturity of 85 days.
The main benchmark rates for US dollar financial assets are the relevant LIBID rates.
In addition to the financial assets above, there are $75m of other current and non-current asset investments on which no interest is received.
After taking into account the effect of the interest rate swaps, the financial assets and liabilities above all reprice or mature within one year and as such are exposed to changes in floating rates of interest.
Financial Statements 101 15 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Foreign currency risk 100% of the Groups major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
As a result, as at 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004, there were no material monetary assets or liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of the Group companies concerned, having taken into account the effect of forward exchange currency contracts that have been used to match foreign currency exposures.
Additionally, movements in exchange rates outside specified limits in respect of approximately 95% of cash flows for three of the Groups principal currency exposures sterling, Swedish kronor and euros settling during 2005 were hedged using purchased currency options.
The policy has been modified for 2006 and as such no hedges were outstanding at 31 December 2005.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market rates and prices.
Changes to the value of the financial instruments are normally offset by our underlying transactions or assets and liabilities.
The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period.
Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date.
For long term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2005, with all other variables held constant.
Because all our debt was hedged effectively to floating rates in 2005, changes in interest rates will not change the carrying value of debt after interest rate swaps.
Based on the composition of our long term debt portfolio as at 31 December 2005, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $10m in interest expense being incurred per year.
The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2005, with all other variables held constant.
The 10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.

None of the financial assets or financial liabilities have been reclassified during the year.
Carrying values are equivalent to fair values for all years presented.

Consequently, an impairment loss of $16m has been recognised in the income statement.
Credit risk accounts for $2m of the fair value change of the 5.4% callable bond and $3m of the 7% guaranteed debenture.
Changes in credit risk have no material effect on the fair value of any other financial liabilities.
The change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk.
With respect to the repayment amounts at maturity of the financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the 7% guaranteed debenture was $287m 2004 $287m, the 5.4% callable bond was $750m 2004 $750m, the bank overdrafts were $84m 2004 $140m and the other loans were $6m 2004 $2m.
