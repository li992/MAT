Share based payments The Group recognised total expenses of 39 million 2004: 39 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year including 2 million in respect of Europe Beverages 2004: 1 million.
The Group has a number of share option plans that are available to Board members and certain senior executives: the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Bonus Share Retention Plan BSRP and the Discretionary Share Option Plans DSOP, full details of which are included in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 41 to 56.
The Group also has a share option scheme for all employees of the Group.
All Options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
The Group has an International Share Award Plan ISAP which is used to reward exceptional performance amongst employees.
An expense is recognised for the fair value at the date of grant of the estimated number of shares that will be awarded to settle the options over the vesting period of each scheme.
Share award fair values The fair value is measured using the valuation technique that is considered to be the most appropriate to value each class of award: these include Binomial models, Black-Scholes calculations and Monte Carlo simulations.
These valuations take into account factors such as non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioral considerations.

This is determined through analysis of historical evidenced exercise patterns of option holders.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous 3 years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of nontransferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The BSRP is available to a group of approximately 155 senior executives including the Executive Directors.
The maximum number of shares awarded in respect of 2005 is 3,141,237 2004: 1,417,545.
Also during the period, matching awards were made over 815,279 shares 2004: 724,571.
The fair value of the shares under the plan is based on the market price of the Companys ordinary shares on the date of the award.
Where the awards do not attract dividends during the vesting period, the market price is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid during the expected life of the awards.
Awards made under this scheme are classified as equity settled.
The expense recognised in respect of these awards was 13 million 2004: 12 million.
Around 100 senior executives including the Executive Directors are granted a conditional award of shares under the LTIP.
The expense recognised in respect of these awards was 4 million 2004: 5 million.
DSOP and share save plans, details of which are set out in b, c and d below, resulted in a charge of 21 million in 2005 2004: 22 million.
